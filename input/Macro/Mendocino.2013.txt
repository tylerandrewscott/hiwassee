To the Honorable Board of Supervisors and Citizens of Mendocino County:
I hereby submit to you the Recommended Budget for Fiscal Year 2013-2014.
The Executive Office is pleased to submit to you a balanced budget for FY 2013-2014 which is largely a continuation of FY
2012-2013. The Recommended Budget is the initial budget for the County until the adoption of the Final Budget in
September of this year. This is a budget focused on system sustainability, investing in County infrastructure, employee
development and capacity enhancement, building the General Reserve, looking beyond the standard twelve-month
budgetary horizon and accomplishing these goals within the revenue framework available.
Major Changes and Important Issues
Capital Improvement Plan: In the 2012-2013 budget, the County was only able to allocate $105,000 toward the County’s
multi- million dollar list of Capital Improvement needs. This recommended budget proposes $1,316,036 be applied to
our Capital Improvement Plan to begin to address the priorities identified by the General Services Agency and the Board
of Supervisors. Many of these projects are long overdue, especially considering that major investment in capital
maintenance and improvements has been deferred since 2006, well before the recession.
Department of Transportation: In the FY 2012-2013 budget, funding to the Department of Transportation from Budget
Unit 1000 was reduced by $1,353,958 in order to pay down County debt. It is important to note that the FY 2013-2014
recommended budget includes restoration of funding to the Department of Transportation from Budget Unit 1000. This
restoration was directed by the Board of Supervisors during approval of the budget last year.
General Reserve: The Auditor’s Office has identified $1,717,866 in largely one-time unanticipated revenue from 2012-13.
In keeping with Board policy, this Recommended Budget includes placing this one-time revenue into the General
Reserve.
Appropriation for Contingencies: As in prior years, the Executive Office recommends placing funding aside for
unanticipated expenses. This recommended budget includes a contingency fund of $650,000.
Retiree Healthcare: In FY 2011-2012, the Board of Supervisors opted to retain a limited retiree health insurance program
through 2013. The CEO’s Recommended Budget includes $416,022 for retiree health care coverage through December
31, 2013.
Long Term Revenues: Revenues continue to inch upward but remain relatively flat. Discretionary revenue projections,
which include local property tax estimates, for FY 2013-2014 are only .3% above the prior year.
Summary of the Recommended Budget
The Recommended Budget for FY 2013-2014 totals $223,831,575 which represents an overall increase of 1.4% from the
prior fiscal year. This includes $156,835,009 in spending from the General Fund which is less than 1% of the overall
increase. There is a minimal increase in discretionary general fund revenues which are projected at $59,583,000 as
compared to $59,382,734 in last year’s Final Budget.
As in 2012-2013, the FY 2013-2014 Recommended Budget is balanced without drawing down reserves. In fact, the
reserves are growing stronger and so is the County’s future stability and sustainability. As we continue to see signs of an
improving economy both statewide and here in Mendocino County, we must remain cautious as locally derived revenue
remains stagnant while pension system and long-term health care costs continue to rise. Our multi-front battle to
contain or lower costs is working. We must continue to control costs, strengthen our reserves, and look for innovative
methods of doing business that will benefit the County of Mendocino now and into the future.
The County’s largest and most important revenue source comes from property taxes. Mendocino County has been
fortunate in that this important revenue source has not declined as of the presentation of this Recommended
Budget. Initial projections show Secured Property Tax Revenues remaining flat.
Sales tax growth has slowed significantly as compared to the FY 2010-2011 and FY 2011-2012. We are experiencing
some growth but at a slow rate. The County’s quarterly budget review process will be very important in terms of
monitoring these revenue levels and if there is a downward trend, the County may need to act by reducing down
expenditures.
Similar to the Sales Tax, this budget projects a modest recovery in the Room Occupancy Tax that is experiencing a
slow rate of growth. The County continues to partner with other organizations and agencies to market our tourist
destinations and is contributing approximately $325,000 towards these efforts in FY 2013-2014.
This budget continues to take a very conservative approach with more historical sources of County revenue. The
recession brought the Timber Yield Tax to unprecedented low levels, and while there was an increase in this
activity it is now clear that this revenue stream’s past importance as a major revenue stream has diminished for
the foreseeable future.
The County’s Budget Unit 1000 is composed of all the above revenue categories in addition to several others such
as tobacco settlement funds and interest income. Together these funds as represented in Budget Unit (BU) 1000,
compose the discretionary general fund revenues for the County and it is these revenues that the Board of
Supervisors wields the highest degree of authority over to appropriate. In FY 2012-13, we received a larger than
budgeted amount of Tobacco Settlement Funds which is reflected in the graph above and one-time proceeds from
the dissolution of Redevelopment. We do not expect that to happen again and moving forward, it is expected that
BU 1000 receipts will be largely static. The Executive Office will continue to monitor through the quarterly budget
review process.
Over the past decade the County’s General Reserve levels have been consistently under-funded and were even
drawn down during the height of the housing bubble. Throughout this period of time the County never achieved its
own Board directed level of reserves. Nationally accepted standards call for a reserve of between 8 and 15 percent
of the general fund, yet, the County had less than 2% across the entire general fund when it was needed most.
Since the end of FY 2011-2012, the County has been able to place unanticipated revenue into the General Reserve
at the close of each fiscal year. Currently, the estimated balance in the General Reserve on June 30, 2013 is
$4,541,741 which is nearing 50% of the Board’s recommended balance. This current CEO Recommended Budget
places an additional $1.7 million into the General Reserve. The actual amount of the contribution to the General
Reserve will be determined in the 2013-2014 final budget.
For the FY 2013-2014 Recommended Budget, the largest budgetary increase in terms of percentage is in the
Recreation and Culture category due to the addition of funding to the Museum for staff and college student
interns. The Debt Service percentage decrease is due to Certificates of Participation (COP) refinancing.
