We present to the Board of Supervisors a Fiscal Year 2016-2017 County of Imperial
Recommended Budget package that includes our Proposal to Balance and the backup schedules to the
budget all in accordance with the County Budget Act (California Government Code Sections 29000 -
29144 and 30200). For California counties the Act requires that we have in place a balanced
recommended budget by June 30 and adoption of an annual budget not later than October 2nd.
This budget year our plan is to present the Board a recommended budget and to conduct
budget hearings during the budget presentation. The budget hearings is a time for the Board to hear
comments from the public and or departments regarding revisions, reductions or additions to the
budget. Upon completion of the budget presentation and budget hearings we look to the Board to
provide the Executive Office and budget staff direction on budget adjustment requests that were
presented to the Board. In prior years, we closed budget hearings at the conclusion of presentations
and either held a special Board meeting to adopt the adjusted Recommended Budget or adopted the
budget at the following regular meeting. The plan, subject to Board approval, is to close the hearings
after the presentations and return on June 30 for a special budget meeting to adopt the revised
Recommended Budget as approved by the Board.
The Proposal to Balance included in your budget package reflects a carryover balance of $10
million from FY 2015-2016 and projected revenue and expenditures derived from budget worksheets
submitted by departments. In addition, we included a 10% transfer ($1,355,286) of 1991 Realignment
funds received by Behavioral Health and Public Health during FY 2015-2016 (W&I C 17600.20) and a
transfer from the County's Revenue Stabilization Reserve of $5,437,744. While the actual carryover is
not known until the third week in July the figure of $10 million is a conservative number that the
Auditor-Controller and my office feels is a safe assumption.
Our intent in presenting and adopting the budget much earlier than prior years is more of a
convenience for departments as it will allow departments the ability to start programs sooner, the
ability to hire or promote staff without having to wait three months into the fiscal year and the ability
of departments to bring to the Board program budget changes for which they just recently received
notice.

On or before July 22nd the County Auditor-Controller's office will provide the actual carryover
balance from FY 2015-2016. At that time my office will determine the next course of action based on
the carryover balance and its effect on the budget balancing proposal methodology presented in the
Proposal to Balance. Should there be a need to return to the Board it would be to:
1. Request approval to transfer additional funds from Revenue Stabilization.
2. Implement an across the board reduction in certain operational appropriations, i.e. Office
Expense, Professional & Specialized Services, Out of County Travel and Special Department
Expense.
3. Approval of filling of budgeted vacancies.
Background:
Similar to past years the budget process begins early February. My direction to budget staff
and departments was to submit "status quo" budgets requests. We did make allowances however for
salaries, benefits, Board approved contracts/agreements/MOU's, changes in funding of programs, loss
reserves and ITS and Communications service charges. Departments were to submit Budget
Augmentation Requests for all other increases and or additions to their budget. Budget staff
developed a schedule of the augmentations requests for my review and funding recommendation.
Departments were informed of my recommendation and those who would like to have their request
for funding reconsidered will have an opportunity to address you today.
In developing our Proposal to Balance, we used a General Fund budget summary report from
ONESolution that provided revenue and expenditure numbers of all General Fund budget units. The
report showed that total expenditures exceeded revenue by $16,384,440. In FY 2015-2016 that
amount was $10, 7 17, 330. While we have averaged a carryover balance above $10 million our
conservative assumption is $10 million as stated earlier.
Before going into what makes up the difference you need to know that the augmentations presented
are not part of this revenue versus expenditure difference and does not include capital
purchases/projects. They are however included in the Proposal to Balance.
The following information is provided to explain some of the difference:
1. Countywide salary and benefit costs for FY 2016-2017, including merit increases for eligible
employees and the Board approved 2. 5% Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA ) totals $136, 497,600.
This is $8, 587,926 or a six (6) percent increase over 2015-2016. There was no increase in the
Employer Retirement Contribution Rates for FY 2016-2017 however, there were changes in the
Pension Obligation Bond (POB ) rate and Retiree Health rate. POB decreased and Retiree Health
increased slightly. The Net Cost to the General Fund for salary and benefits is $2.8 million.
2. Countywide operational costs excluding salary and benefits we estimate based on the monthly
average will exceed FY 2015-2016 by $12, 871,904 or an increase of 5.8%. The Net Cost to the
General Fund is $4,247,942.

Requested Action:
1. Acknowledge receipt of Recommended Budget for Fiscal Year 2016-2017 and related backup
schedules.
2. Accept Fiscal Year 2016-2017 Proposal to Balance subject to Board revision
3. Conduct Budget Hearings to address public comments and department appeals to nonrecommended
budget augmentations.
4. Close Budget Hearings and provide direction to Executive Office on adjustments to FY 2016-
2017 Recommended Budget.
5. Schedule Special Meeting for June 30 to adopt County of Imperial FY 2016-2017 budget as
revised.
