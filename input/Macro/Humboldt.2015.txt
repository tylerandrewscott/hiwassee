Welcome to Humboldt County’s budget for Fiscal Year (FY) 2015-16. I would like
to thank the community for their participation in the live interactive community
budget meeting held on February 28th. I would also like to thank our county
department heads and staff for their participation in the budget process. And I
would like to thank your Board for your leadership as the county continues to search
for a road to financial recovery.
The proposed budget totals $318,655,867. This is an increase of $13.1 million over
the prior year, due principally to $8.9 million in public safety expense funded by
Measure Z, and Health and Human Services costs for increased employee costs such
as health insurance and retirement. The proposed budget for the General Fund, the
fund that contains the county’s discretionary dollars, is $111,803,172 in revenue and
$114,883,535 in expenditures. This means there is a General Fund total deficit for
FY 2015-16 of $3.08 million. Of this $3.08 million, $1.48 million is a structural
deficit, and the remaining balance is for one-time costs such as $1.2 million for
contingencies and $400,000 for a contribution to the General Reserve as approved in
the FY 2014-15 first-quarter and mid-year budget reports.
The road to financial recovery remains elusive. While we proposed a budget for FY
2013-14 that contained a General Fund deficit of $2.9 million, restraint on the part
of departments and unexpected positive revenue news resulted in an actual loss to
fund balance of only $800,000. Similarly, although we proposed a FY 2014-15
budget with a General Fund deficit of $2.75 million (itself a small step in the right
direction), current estimates point to a reduction in fund balance of only $1.3 million
by June 30, 2015.
Unfortunately, new costs for FY 2015-16 are leading to a recommended budget with
another deficit of $3.08 million. Given the positive results we have experienced
over the past two years compared with our initial budget projections, I believe this
recommendation better serves the community’s needs than would a new round of
service reductions. However, this remains an unsustainable budget picture and staff
will continue to work to address it—including tackling rising retirement costs.
In FY 2014-15 the county began to chart a new course by engaging in systems
review to help the budget deficit. There was a course adjustment early on in FY
2014-15 with the passing of the county’s half-cent sales tax measure, Measure Z.
While Measure Z is anticipated to bring in $8.9 million in revenue for our
community in FY 2015-16, it does not solve all of the county’s problems. Measure
Z was not designed to fill the structural gap in the county’s General Fund. Measure
Z was designed to provide funding for essential services such as Sheriff’s deputies
and prosecutors in the District Attorney’s Office. You will see recommended
expenditures that fulfill this promise throughout this budget proposal, with a
complete listing in the Appendix.
The Board of Supervisors appointed a Citizens’ Advisory Committee that has
played an integral part in reviewing $18.66 million in Measure Z funding requests.
The entire committee met nine times between February and May 2015. In early
May 2015, the committee submitted their Measure Z funding recommendations of
$8.9 million to the County Administrative Office (CAO) for inclusion in the
proposed budget. I want to personally thank the members of the committee for their
time and dedication to this process. Each member of this committee served on a
volunteer basis and dedicated numerous hours to this new and exciting endeavor. I
would also like to thank CAO staff Elishia Hayes and Nicole Morrow for staffing
these committee meetings. Because of all of these efforts, the FY 2015-16
proposed budget includes $1.5 million for the District Attorney’s Office, $602,724
for Probation and $3.4 million for the Sheriff. In addition, other local agencies will
receive Measure Z funding: $10,452 for Area 1 Agency on Aging; $267,543 for
K’ima:w Medical Center; $400,000 for the Eureka Police Department; and $2.6
million for rural fire.
While the county was able to pass Measure Z, it lost the ability to claim federal
Title IV-E dollars for Probation’s case management services, a loss of over
$700,000. The Citizens’ Advisory Committee has recommended over $600,000 in
funding for Probation services, but this money is to restore services that have
previously been cut. Probation faces an additional challenge of more than $700,000
due to loss of Title IV-E funding. These funds support services that have not yet
been reduced—Probation has backfilled this revenue loss with a trust fund that is
now depleted. As noted in the third-quarter budget review, I do not believe it is
possible to completely replace this $700,000 loss with additional General Fund
dollars. However, approximately $575,000 is recommended through a combination
of a $300,000 reduction in General Fund Contingencies and a $275,000 increase in
deficit spending.
Beyond the recommendation to fund a portion of Probation’s additional funding
request the proposed budget includes other on-going funding requests for General
Relief, Courts-County Contribution, Inmate Medical and UC Cooperative
Extension. These additional funding requests, with the exception of Probation and
UC Cooperative Extension, are state mandated and therefore we are not in a
position to deny funding.
In closing, I would like to thank the staff of Management and Budget Team: Cheryl
Dillingham, Amy Nilsen, Elishia Hayes and Sean Quincey for their hard work and
perseverance in putting this FY 2015-16 proposed budget together. In addition, I
would also like to thank the Auditor’s Office for assisting with the budget
development process and their continued cooperation with our budget efforts.
