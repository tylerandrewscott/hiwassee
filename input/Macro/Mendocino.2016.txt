It is my pleasure to present the FY 2016-17 Proposed Budget to your Board. This year’s budget
development included three public workshops with the Board and multiple discussions during
other Board meetings, regarding funding priorities for next year and future years.
The FY 2016-17 Proposed Budget is structurally balanced and allows the County organization to
provide core services, while utilizing one-time funding for critical infrastructure investments
and community programs. It is an accomplishment of this Board that our finances are vastly
improved from only a few years ago. However, we must remain prepared for an economic
downturn due to signals in the national, state, and local economy. Given our ability to garner
information on a state and national level, this budget was prepared taking a fiscally conservative
approach.
The Proposed Budget includes the information that you are familiar with, as if you were
approving the Recommended Budget. Additionally, this year the Proposed Budget includes the
Schedules 1-4, & 9. Normally these are not provided in June, but are prepared after the Board
approves the Recommended Budget. Having the Schedules this early will provide your Board
with additional information prior to Budget Hearings on June 7th and 8th. After the Board
formally adopts the budget on June 21st, the Executive Office will finalize the FY 2016-17
Adopted Budget book.
Lastly, it is with pride that I inform you Mendocino County received the Distinguished Budget
Presentation Award again this year. This award, from the Government Finance Officers
Association, is the highest form of recognition and represents a significant achievement by
Mendocino County.
I appreciate the Board’s interest in the County’s finances and continued commitment to fiscal
restraint and prudence. As always, if you have any questions on my recommendations, please
feel free to contact me or Assistant CEO Alan Flora.

This report includes adjustments recommended to the Board of Supervisors. A summary of the major adjustments is
included in this section, with a detailed list following.
Labor Agreements
In FY 2015-16 the Board approved several labor agreements with employee bargaining units which included
employee stipends. These agreements reflect a dedication from the Board and the importance of investment in
County employees, in a sustainable way so as not to deteriorate the County’s financial health. For FY 2016-17 the
Proposed Budget includes $544,882 allocated to departments to cover these employee stipends. The $200,000 of
General Fund dedicated to the Board’s Retention Pay Program is included as part of the total $500,000
Contingency. This program continues into the second and final year of the SEIU labor agreement.
BU 1000 Discretionary Revenue
The Auditor-Controller’s projections are the same as third quarter, with the difference of $6,758,535 being the shift
of Proposition 172 funding from BU 1000 directly to the Public Safety Budget Units: District Attorney - BU 2070,
Sheriff-Coroner - BU 2310, Jail - BU 2510, and Probation - Budget Unit 2560. These budget units have also had
their Proposition 172 funds decreased from the amounts included in the Department NCC assignments based on
the Board direction to provide $564,874 of Proposition 172 funding to support Fire Districts. This funding is
appropriated in BU 4016 - Emergency Medical Services.
The Auditor’s projections for discretionary revenue include modest increases in property tax revenue with a slight
regression in room occupancy tax revenue due to a number of one time corrections in FY 15-16, and a continued
slight decline in sales tax receipts. A detailed breakdown of discretionary revenue projections is included on page
31.
Budget Unit 1000 includes transfers of General Fund dollars to other funds. The Proposed Budget includes total
transfers of $11,195,411 to the Department of Transportation, the Library, the Debt Service Fund, the Vehicle
Replacement Fund, the IT Reserve, and the Capital Improvement Fund. These transfers are further detailed in
various charts included in this report.
Debt Mitigation & Elimination
Reserves & Contingencies
A portion of the available fund balance is recommended to be utilized to strengthen several reserve funds. The
budget includes recommendations to increase the General Fund reserve by $126,325 from $11,500,000 to
$11,626,325. This reserve is the County’s primary protection against an economic downturn or significant
emergency. While the General Reserve is significantly healthier than several years ago, it is still well below optimum
levels.
There is a continuing concern about the health of the County’s pension plan, and the large unfunded liability with
the plan. In addition, due to the GASB 67/68 requirements effective in 2015 for net pension reporting; liabilities
are now listed on financial statements. The Pension Gap Reserve was increased to $3,650,000 in FY 2015-16 to
provide for unanticipated fluctuations in County pension contributions. The employer rates for FY 2016-17 declined
slightly over the prior year and use of the Pension Gap Reserve is not recommended at this time. Additionally, the
Proposed Budget does not include recommendations to increase the Pension Gap Reserve.
The County is required to maintain a Teeter Fund reserve to provide funding to taxing entities, regardless of
delinquencies. The Teeter Fund reserve protects the General Fund in the event of an additional property tax decline
and recession that would require additional funding. The Teeter Fund reserve’s current balance is $2,000,000.
The Proposed Budget does not include recommendations to adjust the Teeter Reserve.
The Proposed Budget includes a $500,000 appropriation for contingencies. Contingencies are used for unexpected
expenses that arise during the year. This amount would be the first source of additional funding tapped before an
14
emergency or economic disaster required the use of the General Reserve. Due to Board priorities for funding road
projects and providing funding for emergency services, only $500,000 is recommended for the Contingency. This
amount includes $200,000 provided for the second year of the Board’s Retention Pay Program. This funding will be
utilized to provide retention payments to eligible employees in the General Fund.
The additional funding provided to reserves and contingencies is all one time money from projected fund balance
carryover.
Investment in County Roads
The Proposed Budget recommends including $2,400,000, of which $1,365,464 is one-time funding. The
Proposed Budget recommends including an additional $411,685 of one-time funding for corrective maintenance.
Similar to FY 2015-16, the Director of Transportation will make recommendations for critical roadways to focus on
with the additional corrective maintenance money.
Investing in the Organization & Infrastructure
The FY 2015-16 Proposed Budget includes a variety of funding to invest in the organization. While an important
part of investment in the organization is directly related to salaries and benefits for employees, there are many other
aspects involved in providing a positive, efficient, and productive work environment for employees and the public.
This includes the County’s infrastructure such as facilities and vehicles required to conduct County business. The
Proposed Budget includes cost of living salary adjustments approved by the Board for various labor groups,
including funding for one-time stipends and the Board’s Retention Pay Program. The Human Resources Department
is pursuing many initiatives to better promote the County organization and our open positions and better position
the County to create a competitive edge in attracting new employees. Some of these investments include adding
funding for an expanded training program, software upgrades to shorten the recruitment process time, creation of a
new job fair, and other events to recruit employees. Funding previously appropriated in the Executive Office for the
Leadership Coordinator is moved to Human Resources in support of the County’s Leadership Initiative.
The Proposed Budget includes funding for an additional Deputy Probation Officer to be located on the coast.
Funding for this officer was initially requested of the Community Corrections Partnership (CCP), however a reduction
in FY 2016-17 funding required use of General Fund dollars to support this position. As the Board has directed an
on-going review of services provided on the coast, this analysis by various departments could result in the
recommendation to balance additional resources currently allocated to the inland areas.
Fleet
As with the FY 2015-16, the Fleet Division continues to focus on replacing older, higher mileage vehicles. In
addition, a concerted effort towards standardization of vehicle types based upon reliability, fuel efficiency and ease
of maintenance remains a priority and is being implemented.
For FY 2016-17 and beyond, an added focus will be on alternative fuel vehicles, such as plug-in hybrid and all
electric, and the related infrastructure and staff skills needed to transition from fossil fuels. Electric vehicle charging
stations in Ukiah, Willits and Fort Bragg will allow for the inclusion of electric vehicles in the fleet, which will result in
lower fuel and maintenance costs as the County shifts from traditional fossil fuels to alternative fuels. Standardizing
the fleet with reliable and efficient vehicle types also remains a priority, which, in turn, will further reduce costs
associated with the upkeep and maintenance of the County’s 265 vehicles. The FY 2016-17 Proposed Budget
includes $120,000 for vehicles. This is less than in previous years, and less than the recommended $290,000 per
year in the CIP, due to competing priorities for funding. Very few vehicles were purchased in FY 2014-15, with the
money carried over into FY 2015-16. This allowed for the purchase of 43 vehicles in FY 2015-16, 19 with general
fund dollars, 14 for HHSA, and 10 for the Sheriff’s office. If additional fund balance is realized when the 2015-16
fiscal year is closed, additional vehicle replacement should be a priority investment.
The Executive Office performed an analysis of the fleet over the past year and looked at a variety of options,
including ways of more efficiently utilizing rental vehicles through Enterprise. This has resulted in a “pool” of five
rental vehicles provided on site at the County Garage. They vehicles can be reserved through the County vehicle
reservation system. This was implemented due to Department concerns over customer service shortcomings at the
15
rental company, unpredictability in available vehicles and their cleanliness, and the extra time and inconvenience
required to pick up and drop off vehicles at the rental office.
Capital Improvements
The Capital Improvement Plan includes a total of $6,452,487 for projects in FY 2016-17. This includes new
General Fund dollars of $1,836,573 for new projects and an anticipated FY 2015-16 carryover amount of
$2,379,780. The majority of this funding is from the two large roof projects budgeted in FY 2015-16 that are in
process, but will be completed in FY 2016-17. These projects make up over $2,000,000 of the total. Additional
detail on the projects included in the CIP, are provided on pages 35 - 38.
Economic/Business Development
The Board directed additional focus be placed on support for business development and encouraging economic
investment in the County. Many incentives to development and investment require a change in practices and/or
regulations, and not necessarily a direct financial investment of dollars by the County. Some work has been
completed towards these goals and have included an existing commitment or partnership incorporated in previous
budgets. These commitments remain in place (i.e. the Economic Development Financing Corporation (EDFC)), and
are expanded with additional investments as outlined below. Additional incentives and changes in the regulatory
frame work will be developed by staff as directed by the Board in the coming fiscal year.
? Broadband Expansion– The Proposed Budget includes a total of $55,000 in one-time funding for the
broadband contract (an increase of $15,000 for additional support)
? Permit Fee Waiver Program - The Proposed Budget includes $50,000 to backfill a loss of revenue in PBS for
a Permit Fee Waiver Program based on Board direction
? Support New Housing Development – The Proposed Budget includes $75,000 in one-time funding for an
economic and housing analysis; economic demographic profile $5,900
? Grant Writer Program – The Proposed Budget includes $100,000 for a contract for a grant writer that would
support all County departments
Support for Emergency Services
The Proposed Budget shifts $175,000 from County Public Safety Departments to Emergency Medical Service, BU
4016 for Fire Districts (CSA #3 funds) based on Board direction; and adds $200,000 for grants to ambulance
providers also based on Board direction. The Proposition 172 funds are now being reflected in the Public Safety
budget units; District Attorney, BU 2070; Sheriff-Coroner, BU 2310; Jail, BU 2510; and Probation, Budget Unit
2560. As detailed in BU 1000 above, these budget units have also had their Proposition 172 revenue decreased
proportionately to provide $175,000 to the Fire Districts (CSA #3 funds) in BU 4016 based on Board direction.
Additionally, the Board directed that $200,000 be included in the Proposed Budget to provide support for
ambulance providers in the County. One-time funding is used for the grant to support ambulance service in BU
4016 – Emergency Medical Service.
Homeless Issues
The Proposed Budget recommends adding $100,000 of one-time funding to Social Services Administration, BU
5010 for addressing issues of chronic homelessness in the community. The Board will provide direction in
developing a plan of use of these funds later in the fiscal year.
Supporting Community Partners
The Proposed Budget includes funding for support of a number of community partners. Budget Unit 5010 includes
a total of $70,000 in funding, or $10,000 for each of the seven senior centers in the County. The County’s eight
Family Resource Centers are funded a total of $142,318 for service enhancement. This funding is provided through
Child Abuse Prevention, Intervention, and Treatment (CAPIT) funding; Community Based Child Abuse Prevention
(CBCAP) funding; and Promoting Safe and Stable Families (PSSF) funding. The Laytonville Health Start FRC,
Gualala Action Network, and Round Valley Indian Health Center are provided a total of $90,000 for enhancement
of mental health services in the communities they serve.
16
Support of these programs should be seen as one-time support and may not continue from year-to-year if the
County cannot continue to support its core services. These funds are intended for an enhancement of services and
should not be relied upon by organizations for support of core operations.
Cannabis Program
The State Medical Marijuana Regulation and Safety Act, adopted in 2015, provides for a comprehensive regulatory
framework, including license categories for cultivation, nursery, manufacturer, testing, dispensary, distribution, and
transportation. When fully implemented, except for limited exceptions for qualifying patients and primary caregivers,
the above marijuana related activities will be defined as “commercial cannabis activity” and will require state
licenses which will be issued beginning on or after January 1, 2018. State licensees operating in Mendocino County
must first obtain a license or permit from the County. Mendocino County currently has regulations in place for
cultivation, but does not otherwise have formal regulations for related activities. On November 3, 2015, the Board
approved the formation of a Marijuana Ad Hoc Committee to review “Mendocino County's 9.31 Medical Marijuana
Cultivation Ordinance and report back to the Board with recommended changes by the end of the year”; however,
the ad hoc continued into 2016. In order to protect the general public health, safety and welfare, a marijuana
cultivation urgency ordinance was brought forward by the ad hoc on May 16, 2016, and adopted by the Board on
May 17, 2016.
On March 15th, April 18th and May 19, 2016, the Marijuana Ad Hoc brought forward various recommendations to
consider in the development of a permanent updated 9.31 cultivation ordinance. In addition, the Board gave
direction in May 2016, to initiate the development of a marijuana facilities ordinance to address dispensaries,
manufacturing, laboratories and distribution. Following Board direction in June 2016, and the results of a
California Environmental Quality Act initial study in September 2016, it is anticipated the ordinance will go before
the Planning Commission in November 2016 and before the Board for adoption in December 2016 and January
2017. The tentative launch date for the cultivation program is February or March 2017.
Based on this timeline, additional staff will be required in the Agriculture Department to administer the program as
required by State law. The Proposed Budget includes funding for five staff members to support the program. The
on-going program will be funded by permit fees established by the Board of Supervisors; however some General
Fund money is required to cover program start-up costs of $97,709. This will allow the Agriculture Department to
hire staff in December to prepare for program start-up in early 2017. The budget anticipates permit fees to cover
the on-going program costs through the second half of the fiscal year.
