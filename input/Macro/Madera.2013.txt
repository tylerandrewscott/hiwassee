The Recommended Proposed Budget for Fiscal Year 2013-14 is a balanced budget that provides funding consistent with your Board’s priorities, including an attempt to begin to restore funding levels within the Public Safety Departments. Funding for most General Fund Departments has increased as a result of the elimination of the Furlough Program. Restricted funding for Health and Welfare programs continues to increase this fiscal year, but is dictated by the State and Federal Governments without much discretion at the local level. Though cost-cutting efforts continue as guided by your Board’s adopted Three-Year Cost Reduction & Containment Plan, revenues are projected to fall short of expenditures again in 2013-14 by just under $3.0 million.
COMMENTS ON THE 2013-14 RECOMMENDED PROPOSED BUDGET
In order to address this anticipated deficiency in revenues while minimizing the impact to service levels, this budget utilizes approximately $3.0 million from special, limited one-time funds. The continuation of a selective hiring freeze is recommended again in 2013-14 as a cost containment measure. It is important to note that the Proposed Budget is consistent with your Board’s direction to avoid the use of the limited Teeter Fund reserve and borrowed funds to finance the operations of the County.
Much progress has been made since the revenue shortfall was projected as high as $12.3 million during the 2010-11 Fiscal Year. Since then and through a series of strategic cost-cutting measures and reorganizations authorized by your Board, the revenue shortfall has been reduced significantly from $6.2 million in 2012-13 to a projected $3.0 million. One-time funds and limited designations are again recommended to balance the budget and compensate for the remaining revenue shortfall. As outlined in your Board’s adopted Three-Year Cost Reduction & Containment Plan, reliance on limited designations and one-time funds to balance the budget should be eliminated or significantly curtailed by 2014-15 to prevent depletion of these funds.
Governor Brown signed the 2013-14 State budget into law on June 27, 2013, with only a few of the legislative changes included in the County of Madera’s Recommended Proposed Budget. Part of the State Budget impacting counties is still being modified through trailer bills and will be brought before your Board once details are finalized.
The following are general comments concerning the Recommended Proposed 2013-14 General Fund Budget:
The 2013-14 General Fund Budget has an overall increase of $8.1 million from the 2012-13 Fiscal Year. Following is a brief recap of General Fund functions and other points of interest:
? The General Government category reflects an increase of $0.6 million over Fiscal Year 2012-13. The increase is primarily a result of the elimination of the Furlough Program and includes the transfer of four positions from the Department of Social Services to the Information Technology Department.
The Public Protection category has increased $2.7 million over Fiscal Year 2012-13. The increase is primarily due to the following: elimination of the furlough Program; phased-in operation of the Correctional Facility expansion, including six additional positions; additional positions for the Sheriff’s Department and District Attorney’s Office; and increased costs associated with the Public Defender’s contract.
? The Health and Sanitation category has increased $0.7 million over Fiscal Year 2012-13. The increase is primarily due to the increased funding in Behavioral Health Services and Health Department programs.
? The Public Assistance category has increased $3.2 million over Fiscal Year 2012-13. The increase in this category is generally in the Welfare-Assistance Programs and their administration, and is generally financed by State and Federal funds.
? The Education category (Library and Agricultural Extension) has increased $59,816 over Fiscal Year 2012-13. This increase is primarily due to the elimination of the Furlough Program
? A Reserve for Information Technology System (IT)/Asset Replacement is recommended to be established for $0.9 million within the General Fund. Over the last several years, many IT-related needs have been deferred as a result of the fiscal crisis. Though $0.9 million is not sufficient to address all of those needs, the reserve is recommended to be established so that the County can begin addressing some of the critical needs. One of the largest pending IT projects under consideration is the replacement of the County’s Financial & Personnel Management System. When a new system is recommended later in Fiscal Year 2013-14, your Board will be asked to approve the designation of some portion of this reserve to finance the project.
? The ending Fund Balance resulting from 2012-13 operations, which acts as a funding source to start the 2013-14 Fiscal Year, is estimated at $2,050,000. The Auditor’s Office is scheduled to complete the final June 2013 fund balance calculation after the close-out of the 2012-13 fiscal year, which is expected to be in September. As a result of the Auditor’s Office implementation and completion of an accrual basis of accounting for expenses and revenues, limited use of contingencies, the transfer of one-time revenues, lower encumbrance levels and economic revenues exceeding projections, the previous years’ residual available Fund Balance from 2011 and 2012 was calculated at $6.1 million.
The Public Employees’ Retirement System (PERS) recently notified the County that the miscellaneous employees rate will increase from 18.986% to 20.505% for Fiscal Year 2013-14. The current PERS rate for Law Enforcement employees is 23.100% and will increase to 24.061%. It is anticipated that the rates will increase again in the 2014-15 Fiscal Year.
? Employee Compensation Increases All compensation adjustments that have been agreed to in a Memorandum of Understanding have been budgeted in the individual Departmental budgets.
? The eighth annual debt service payment for the new Government Center is $1,677,032, and this payment is included in this budget.
? At the preparation of this budget, there were approximately 212 discretionary and 215 subvented positions that are vacant from the approximately 1,485 County authorized positions. The 2013-14 County Budget currently has 158 discretionary positions that are recommended to remain vacant and unfunded for Fiscal Year 2013-14.
? Appropriations for Contingency is budgeted at $2,624,416 (1.5% of the General Fund budget) which is deficient for a General Fund Budget of $175 million. A prudent reserve is approximately 3% or $5.3 million. Additionally, funds are included in the contingency account to cover actual costs associated with the two change of venue homicide cases being handled by the District Attorney and the Public Defenders’ Offices, payout costs related to retirements; and other unanticipated events. This reserve amount may change at Final Budget depending on any reductions in State funding or changes in Fund Balance. It is proposed that from July 1, 2013, to at least June 30, 2014, a strict “Selective Hiring Freeze” be continued and managed by the County Administrative Office.
? All previous fiscal commitments by your Board have been included in this Budget.
