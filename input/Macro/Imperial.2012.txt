Honorable Board Members:
Preparation of this year's budget began in early February shortly after the Governor's office
released its 2012-2013 budget proposal. At that time the State of California shared in its Proposed
Budget that it faced a $9.2 billion deficit, which grew to $15.7 by May. And just last week, while the
State passed a balanced budget, it relies on a November ballot initiative- California Sales and Income
Tax Increase Initiative- to balance. Such uncertainty with the State budget makes it difficult to prepare
a proposed balanced county budget as many of our programs rely on state funding.
Notwithstanding, as required by the State Controller's County Budget Act, we submit to you a
2012-2013 Proposed Budget that, with recommended budget adjustment, is balanced. Developing a
proposed budget when our county faces uncertainty as to whether there will be the funding available to
operate certain programs mandated by state or federal statutes is challenging to say the least.
$376,466. Those augmentations are as follows:
Parks and Recreation
Replacement of Redhill Park's
Electrical main breaker boxes
Sheriff
Increase to CFMG for inmate health care per terms / conditions of contract

With an a deficit of $1,743,127 and recommended augmentations of $376,466, it is necessary to
transfer $2,119,593 from the Revenue Stabilization Reserve to balance the budget.
The proposed budget reflects 2,141 position allocations with 75 vacant funded positions and
307.5 vacant unfunded positions.
Should the board accept the presented proposal to balance, the next step is to assist the Auditor's
office to determine the Carryover from FY 2011-2012. The Carryover balance should be determined by
July 23, 2012. Thereafter, staff will work to finalize and prepare the budget for Budget hearings. At the
very latest budgt:t ht:arings art: expected to begin August 14, 2012. With a final budget to be presented
on or about August 21, 2012.
Requested Action:
