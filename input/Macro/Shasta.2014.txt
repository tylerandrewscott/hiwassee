This document represents Shasta County's Recommended Fiscal Year 2014-15 Budget, pursuant to
Section 29062 of the Government Code. The budget Is created from a process that includes
requests prepared by the operating and support departments of the County, review and
recommendations from my office, and compilation by the Auditor-Controller.
The Recommended Budget totals $415,898,763, Including Total Governmental Funds,
$341,671 ,092; Internal Service Funds, $35,479,826; Enterprise Funds, $28,706,394; and Special
Districts and Other Agencies governed by the Board of Supervisors, $10,041,451. The budget
represents the efforts of my staff and managers of the County's many departments who worked
diligently to prepare a budget that reflects departmental needs and program funding requests as well
as the CEO's recommended appropriations for the next fiscal year.
This document Is an administrative tool that provides the framework under which the County will
operate for the fiscal period. Absent mandates, the budget Is a vehicle by which the Board of
Supervisors provides philosophical direction for programs lmpor1ant to the local community.
The budget process, and the ultimate adoption of a balanced budget, requires the cooperation,
dedication, and labor of many individuals. I would like to extend my thanks to all department heads,
and their staff, for the common effort they commit to this annual process. All are to be commended
for their service and dedication to the County of Shasta and Its citizens.

On February 25, 2014, the Board of Supervisors received the FY 2013-14 Mid-Year Report, and
approved the following principles for the FY 2014-15 Budget:
 Continue the Controlled Hiring Process approved by the Board in December 2007.
 Approve no new programs or new positions that are not clearly revenue supported.
 Review all grant funded positions. The Board has consistently maintained that the County will
not preserve positions that have lost grant funding.
 The County administers many costly State programs. We have limited ability to raise
revenues to offset any loss in State and Federal funding. We will avoid back-filling reductions
in such funding when legally permissible, and continue to seek relief from unfunded State
mandates.
 Continue to evaluate all contracts with community providers and agencies to evaluate if
services could be reduced or provided by existing county staff.
 The CEO will review all requests for capital assets and computer equipment. Approval will be
granted if the cost of the equipment is fully revenue offset or is critical to program operations.
 As a baseline, direct departments to prepare a budget with a three percent (3%) increase in
County Contribution or General Fund Net-County-Cost. As the full impact of the State budget
is realized further cost containment measures may be necessary.

Realize salary and benefit savings through collaborative bargaining with our labor partners.
 Review all positions vacant over 18 months.
 Encourage expenditure reductions in the current fiscal year to create carry-over funds for
2014-15.
The Recommended FY 2014-15 General Fund Budget is $71.5 million, which is essentially status
quo when compared to the adjusted FY 2013-14 budget. The prior fiscal year included a one-time
appropriation ($2.0 million) for the County’s match for the Adult Rehabilitation Facility.
Annually, the Auditor-Controller calculates the County’s Maintenance of Effort (MOE) for public
safety. The FY 2013-14 adopted budget for all the public safety departments exceeds the adjusted
MOE Base by $23,675,193. The County subsidy to the combined health and human services
programs has been held static over the last several years.
LONG-RANGE PLANNING
There has been no significant improvement to revenues, and the County continues to adhere to
conservative spending due to the continued economic downturn. Taking a proactive approach to
spending reductions in the past several fiscal years has helped keep the County solvent; but, absent
sustained annual revenue growth more reductions may be necessary each fiscal year.
Balancing service delivery with available resources will continue to be a challenge to the County for
many years.
DISCRETIONARY REVENUE
The national, state, and local economic downturn resulted in a decline in property values, lagging
sales of consumer goods and services, and a steep decline in interest rates. Shasta County
continues to experience the unprecedented loss of discretionary revenue. In the prior year the
County realized one-time revenue due to the dissolution of redevelopment agencies. It is anticipated
that revenue will stabilize in FY 2014-15. The dissolution of redevelopment agencies may have
some yet unknown positive impact on the General Fund, as a minimal amount of tax increment may
accrue to the General Fund.

The County’s Community Corrections Partnership Executive Committee (CCPEC), chaired by the
Chief Probation Officer, approved their FY 2014-15 budget at their February 19, 2014 meeting and
included it in their respective FY 2014-15 budget requests. Funding for FY 2014-15 is expected to
be $7 million and appropriations are requested at $8.6 million, balanced with use of $1.6 million in
carryover AB109 Restricted fund balance. Projected fund balance at the end of FY 2014-15,
including FY 2013-14 growth funds to be received in FY 2014-15, is $2.1 million. For a second year,
the CCPEC approved FY 2014-15 funding augmentations in the District Attorney’s and Public
Defender’s budgets as they were responsible to staff nearly all revocation hearings beginning July 1,
2013 as part of the continued transfer of state responsibilities to counties; this includes all Mandatory
Supervision, all Post Release Community Supervision (PRCS), and most of state Parole’s
revocation hearings, as well as the Probation revocation hearings they have always staffed.
Additionally, felony case filings continue to increase and the District Attorney and the Public
Defender will also play crucial roles in the two new specialty courts (Behavioral Health Court and Re-
Entry Court) that were implemented in January 2014. The CCPEC approved the additional revenue
because the 2011 Realignment allocation to the District Attorney and Public Defender (which is
separate from the AB 109/CCP allocation) does not even fund full-time attorney position and does
not include any funding for support staff, training, equipment, supplies, etc.
The state and a nine-member CEO workgroup are currently working on new CCP and DA/PD
funding allocation methodology for FY 2014-15, and growth fund allocations (however, the state
Department of Finance has the authority to make the final determination on the growth allocations).
The Governor’s 2012 November ballot initiative, called the Schools and Local Public Safety
Protection Act of 2012, included a Constitutional Amendment to protect realignment funding for
counties and was approved by the voters on November 6, 2012. The Constitutional Amendment
protects the state funding source for 2011 Realignment revenue which comes from Vehicle License
Fees (VLF) in the statewide amount of $453.4 million and 1.0625% of the state’s sales and use tax
(SUT) that would have ordinarily gone to the state general fund. Both of these funding sources,
though now constitutionally protected are not stable, as receipts are directly related to the health of
the economy, and the ever-changing allocation methodology.
As reported in the media, the Governor is under pressure to release an additional 10,000 inmates
from prison by February 28, 2016 to meet the Three-Judge Panel’s order to reduce state prison
capacity to 137.5 percent of designed capacity. Therefore it is possible that we could see the AB
109 population grow to levels higher than estimated with no additional funding.
Finally, the state is projecting a decline in AB 109 funding. When the state originally projected AB
109 population numbers associated with the implementation of AB 109, the two largest components
were (1) the offenders who now serve time for lower-level felonies in county jails and (2) the PRCS
population who are now supervised county probation departments following release from state
prison. The latter cohort was expected to diminish in the fourth year of implementation (FY 2014-15),
and the state assumed a commensurate drop in funding. It now appears, however, that counties are
seeing a flattening1 – but not a significant drop – in the PRCS population. The table below details 

CSAC believes that counties are at a critical stage in building long-term programming and
supervision capacity at the local level and will advocate for the state to provide funding to shore up
the $87 million FY 2014-15 gap, and to sustain funding levels to ensure programmatic stability into
the next fiscal year.
The State plans to accelerate early releases of “non-violent” and “Non-sex-offender” second strikers;
the Governor’s May Revise did include a one-time statewide payment in the amount of $11.3 million
to go directly to Probation Departments to supervise these early released second-strikers on Post
Release Community Supervision.
The Governor is proposing legislation that would require any offender sentenced under realignment
with a sentence of ten years or more to serve their sentence in state prison instead of at the local
level. Former state prisoners are staying in local jails for longer periods of time (exacerbating
existing capacity issues), in facilities not designed for such long commitments.
If approved by the legislature, Governor’s May Revise will benefit counties as follows:
 Funds for CCP implementation grants, to assist counties in their efforts to update and report
to the state on their CCP Plans; $100,000 for Shasta;
 Additional funding for the Governor’s Reentry Proposal, whereby state prisoners with mental
health issues being released from prison will have access to services 6 to 12 months prior to
release;
 Additional funding to city police departments for realignment related impacts ($27.5 million in
FY 2013-14, $40 million in 2014-15);
 Additional funding for the Governor’s Recidivism Reduction Fund which provides funds for
“State Reentry in the Community,” which provides a variety of reentry programs to state
prisoners who are one year from release; CDCR and county probation departments will work
with these offenders prior to release, and contemplates that probationers and parolees could
be referred to these facilities or programs by the probation officer, the parole agent, or the
court;
Finally, the CDCR has agreed to reduce the Fire Camp contract rate to $10 per day per inmate
(while in training, the rate is $81 per day per inmate).

Receipts from Public Safety Augmentation Proposition 172 sales tax have not shown any growth in
the current year; receipts to date are just one percent above the prior year. The County’s pro-rata
share of this sales tax was decreased for a second year (from 0.004889 to 0.004734) in mid-year,
and the State recouped over $187,000 with the 5th distribution. We are cautiously optimistic the
receipts will at least meet the budget target.

The General Reserve is approximately $10.5 million. This is 3 percent of total Government Funds
appropriations ($341.6 million). The Board established a policy for budgetary reserves in
December 2007. The goal is to attain a Reserve of 5 percent of estimated financing uses, less
designations for reserves and capital projects, but no less than $10 million.
YEAR-TO-YEAR COMPARISON
Departments were directed to submit a budget request with a target of 3 percent growth in the
General Fund contribution or Net-County-Cost, which could be achieved by spending reductions in
FY 2013-14. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2014, the General Fund is projected to realize a 12
percent reduction in expenditures, and a reduction to the net-county-cost ($10 million).
The Recommended FY 2014-15 General Fund Budget is $71.5 million, which is essentially status
quo when compared to the adjusted FY 2013-14 budget.
In the aggregate, the Recommended FY 2014-15 budget for select budget units, excluding special
districts, totals $405.7 million, which when compared to the 2013-14 Adjusted Budget, is an increase
of $2.3 million, or less than one percent.
The following Table compares by Fund the 2013-14 Adjusted Budget (at 01/31/2014), versus
estimated expenditures at 6/30/2014, with the 2014-15 Adopted Budget for select budget units.

OVERVIEW OF SELECT BUDGET UNITS
AGRICULTURAL COMMISSIONER/SEALER OF WEIGHTS & MEASURES
There have been relatively few statutory or regulatory changes that have impacted the department
during the past year. SB 485 became law and changed how the cooperative state/county
Weighmaster inspection program is managed. This bill requires Sealers to add several additional
inspection requirements to their Weighmaster inspections in order to confirm that junk dealers are in
compliance with newer requirements that apply to the buying and selling of non-ferrous metals. This
bill is meant to be an additional tool to fight the proliferation of metal thefts in the state.
The department plans to present an amendment to the Board of Supervisors before June 30, 2014
to amend the department’s current fee schedule. If approved, these changes should add
approximately $33,000 in fee revenue to the department annually.
ASSESSOR
The function of the Assessor is to produce an annual assessment roll that reflects the taxable values
of land, improvements, and personal property by the Assessor’s parcel numbering system or
account numbering system. In addition to the taxable value, the roll must also indicate the current
status of ownership; the owner’s mailing address and the existence of any exemptions. To
accomplish this, the Assessor must discover, classify and appraise all locally assessable property
according to constitutional, statutory, and administrative requirements. In addition to preparing the
annual local assessment roll pursuant to Section 601 of the California Revenue and Taxation Code,
the Assessor must produce the supplemental assessment roll as provided in Sections 75 through
75.8 of the Revenue and Taxation Code.
For 2013-14 there were 108,643 locally assessed properties in Shasta County with a taxable value
of $15,058,743,748 generating more than $150 million in property tax revenue for use by Shasta
County agencies that include: County government, the three cities, school districts, and other local

taxing agencies. These figures represent an increase of 2.79 percent in taxable value and property
tax revenue over the previous year.
CAPITAL PROJECTS
The Capital Projects budget (Land, Buildings and Improvements) includes 7 projects totaling $2.2
million: 1) Placer Street DPW Upper-N Remodel, $363,548; 2) MHSA Breslauer Remodel, $1.3
million; 3) Mental Health Building Roof, $25,000; 4) Opportunity Center Transit Shelter, $50,000;
5) Jail Phase-1 Hot Water System Upgrade, $185,000; 6) Social Services Cascade Building
Addition, $250,000; and 7) Facilities Management Building Roof, $45,000. Each project is funded by
a dedicated funding stream and none require a General Fund contribution.
Additionally, planning is underway for a new adult rehabilitation facility. This multi-year project
includes appropriations of $2 million in 2014-15. When fully built-out the project is estimated to cost
$22.5 million, with a County-match and in-kind match of $2.5 million. The County-match has been
fully appropriated.
COUNTY FIRE
Appropriations are requested at status quo for the FY 2014-15 Requested Budget, or $6.3 million.
Salaries and Benefits are also status quo at $360,436. Services and Supplies are requested at $1.4
million, a 3.1 percent reduction compared to the FY 2013-14 Adjusted Budget. Other Charges are
requested at $3.7 million, a 14.8 percent increase ($485,652) due to increased Central Service A-87
charges and a requested increase of $440,230 (13.8 percent) in the CAL FIRE administrative
contract in order to fund Engine 43, and related staff, located at the CAL FIRE station on Airport
Drive (this is a county-funded engine). The CAL FIRE contract amount is an estimate and could
change slightly due to actual services provided during the fiscal year. CAL FIRE annually bills the
County for contract services on an actual cost basis and in FY 2013-14 the contract was budgeted at
$3,192,238 but projections for actual costs are currently at $2,560,000.
The department has requested $800,000 in replacement capital assets for FY 2014-15, a decrease
of $426,933, or 34.8 percent, from the FY 2013-14 Adjusted Budget. The requests for FY 2014-15
replacement capital assets include one fire engine for Airport Station 43, one water tender for
Volunteer Fire Company (VFC) 33 Bella Vista, two four-wheel drive trucks for administration (one for
training and one for fleet), and two Lifepak (15 cardiac monitor defibrillators) for VFC 11 Hat Creek.
Revenue totals for FY 2014-15 are requested at just over $5.2 million, an increase of 14.5 percent,
or $666,282 from the FY 2013-14 Adjusted Budget. This is primarily due to a one-time prior period
expenditure adjustment (Risk Management rate refund) in the amount of $324,743 and an additional
request of $711,899 in General Fund transfer-in support above the recommended three percent
increase, to fund Engine 43 (this is a county-funded engine located at CAL FIRE station on Airport
Drive) for the entire 2014-15 fiscal year.
The FY 2014-15 Requested Budget General Fund support is $2,493,446 compared to $1,729,657 in
the FY 2013-14 Adjusted Budget (compared to $1,651,657 in the FY 2012-13 Adjusted Budget
which was increased by $78,000 to fund the increased Volunteer Firefighter Per Call Stipend from
$6 to $12 as approved by the Board on January 15, 2013). General Fund support had declined from
a high of just over $2.1 million in FY 2007-08 to $1.6 million in FY 2012-13. However, County Fire
continued to provide the same level of services to communities by relying on fund balance.
Continued reliance on fund balance to balance the budget could cause the department’s fund
balance to be depleted by FY 2015-2016 and/or could eventually impact services in the future. The
department requests a use of fund balance for FY 2014-15 in the amount of $1,105,534 but projects

to return $856,251 to fund balance at the end of FY 2013-14. If the department ends FY 2014-15 as
projected there will be approximately $1.15 million remaining in fund balance.
The CEO recommends reducing the General Fund transfer-in by $411,899, or 16.5 percent, which
will increase the department’s use of fund balance in the same amount. This General Fund support
will still allow for a three percent increase over the FY 2013-14 Adjusted Budget, as well as a onetime
augmentation of $300,000.
ELECTIONS
Because elections now generally occur once per fiscal year, the prior high/low cycle of budgeting
has evened out. Now, variation comes over a longer period of time – the four year election cycle.
Larger financial need occurs in the Presidential years (divisible by four) which have traditionally
higher voter turnout as compared to the Gubernatorial years.
In the 2014-15 Requested Budget the department assumes that there will be one election, the
regularly scheduled Gubernatorial General Election in November, 2014.
HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES
The combined budgeted fund balance draw for FY 2014-15 from the Social Services, Mental Health,
and Public Health reserves is approximately $3.9 million, which is $1.7 million higher than the
projected draw for FY 2013-14. The requested HHSA budgets are conservative; however, the
reserves could become too low to sustain future years of fund balance draw absent revenue growth
or relief from non-mandated services.
There are continued immediate concerns relative to the Mental Health budget. If anticipated
revenues don’t materialize, HHSA will need to consider taking action in addition to what is proposed
in the FY 2014-15 budget. The HHSA budget request for FY 2014-15 includes a proposal to transfer
approximately $1.3 million from Social Services 1991 realignment and $481,412 from Social
Services 2011 realignment to Mental Health to offset a shortfall in the hospitalization and institutional
care areas of the Mental Health budget as well as continued delays in receipt of cost settlement
revenue. Since March 2012, costs for acute hospitalization and Institutes for Mental Diseases
(IMDs) have stayed at the higher levels. Costs in these categories are projected to be approximately
$1 million higher in the current year and $1.2 million higher in the budget year than the FY 2012-13
actual expenditures. Most of the IMD cost is ineligible for Medi Cal reimbursement and, thus, must
be supported within department realignment funds. Efforts to curb costs in this area have been
somewhat successful and will continue, but the number of people presenting at local hospitals and
the length of their treatment, due to seriousness of their illness, have made costs difficult to control.
Another significant concern is the responsibility for those with mild to moderate diagnosed mental
health illnesses. Currently, services for this population are administered by health plans, while
counties, through managed care, are responsible for those diagnosed with severe mental health
illnesses. With the State’s continuing efforts to divert costs to counties, discussions are occurring
about shifting responsibility for those with mild to moderate diagnosed mental health illnesses to
counties with no additional funding attached. Shasta County is working closely with the County
Mental Health Director’s Association (CMHDA) to participate in these ongoing discussions and
ensure county mental health departments’ are represented.

INTERMOUNTAIN FAIR
In FY 2011-12, the California Department of Agriculture, Division of Fairs and Expositions funding
was eliminated from the state budget. Since this loss of funding the Intermountain Fair has been
using fund balance to balance their budget. On January 28, 2014, the Board of Supervisors
approved the County to enter into an agreement with the Intermountain Fair Heritage Foundation to
lease the Intermountain Fair Grounds and operate the annual County fair.
PUBLIC DEFENDER
The FY 2014-15 budget requests appropriations of $3.77 million, which is $245,449, or 7 percent,
more than the $3.52 million FY 2013-14 Adjusted Budget. Salaries and Benefits are requested at
almost $3.2 million, compared to $2.94 million in the FY 2013-14 Adjusted Budget, primarily due to
the one-time increase in Other Post-Employment Benefits (OPEB), and standard increases in
retirement and health insurance. Services and Supplies are requested at $514,357, status quo.
Central Services A-87 charges have increased 19.2 percent over the FY 2013-14 Adjusted Budget,
from $60,764 to $72,436.
Revenues are requested at $214,556, which is $20,839, or 10.8 percent, more than the FY 2013-14
Adjusted Budget. This increase is due a one-time Risk Management rate rebate in the amount of
$61,433. More importantly, there is a projected 12.2 percent decrease in Public Defender 2011
Realignment revenues, from $94,536 to $83,123, which includes estimated growth funds to be
received in FY 2014-15 in the amount of $17,782 (down from $23,919 in FY 2013-14), along with a
31.2 percent decrease in realignment revenue allocated from the Community Corrections
Partnership (CCP) Executive Committee in the amount of $45,000 (from $91,808 in FY 2013-14) to
help fund an extra-help Social Worker position ($36,000) and financial support to help fund one fulltime
attorney position and one full-time social worker position dedicated to realignment ($9,000); the
department is using $87,877 in realignment restricted fund balance leaving a $14,719 balance. The
net county cost is requested at $3.55 million, which is a 6.7 percent increase ($224,610) from the FY
2013-14 Adjusted Budget. However, due to thoughtful and efficient operations throughout the year
the department projects $124,552 in savings at the end of FY 2013-14.
Except for two minor technical changes that do not change the net county cost, the CEO
recommends the budget as requested by the department head, including extending the sunset date
for the CCP-funded attorney to June 30, 2015.
PUBLIC SAFETY
As a starting point the public safety departments - District Attorney, Juvenile Rehabilitation Facility,
Probation, and the various Sheriff’s budget units, including the Jail, were directed to budget for a
three percent increase in General Fund support and decrease Public Safety Augmentation (Prop
172) revenue in the same amount that was offset by the one-time Risk Management rate rebate,
$2.7 million. The District Attorney, Chief Probation Officer, and the Sheriff have worked diligently to
provide a FY 2014-15 budget that protects public safety and fulfills their core missions with
consideration for the County’s overall fiscal health.
Funding for public safety subvention programs such as booking fees, small and rural sheriff’s grants,
COPS, SAFE, CalMMET, juvenile reentry, juvenile justice, Youth Offender Block Grant, and juvenile
probation is now funded with 2011 Realignment and the funding source is constitutionally protected
via Proposition 30 approved by the state’s voters on November 6, 2012. State revenue projections
have been realized and stable since FY 2011-12.
Total Adopted FY 2014-15 appropriations for the public safety group are $63.4 million, an increase
of $3 million from the current year primarily due to the new and expanding county duties and 

obligations related to 2011 Realignment (such as continuing to expand enrollment at the Community
Corrections Center/Day Reporting Center and the Sheriff’s Work Release Program, implementing
two new specialty courts (Behavioral Health Court and Re-Entry Court), as well as increasing
enrollment of low-level offenders in to programs, services, and treatment) and increased operational
costs for the new Juvenile Rehabilitation Facility. Revenues from all sources total $57.1 million,
including $23.5 million from the General Fund and $10.8 million from Public Safety Augmentation.
To balance his budgets, the Sheriff will utilize a little over $2.6 million in fund balance, the District
Attorney will use $1.1 million in fund balance, and the Probation Department will use $2.5 million in
fund balance. However, of these amounts, which total a little over $6.3 million, $3.1 million is from
Restricted fund balance accounts such as 2011 Realignment, asset forfeiture, and SB 678 (revenue
from the state related to shared savings by reducing the number of adult felony probationers who
return to prison) and $1.6 million is from Public Safety Augmentation reserves ($348,943 in also
allocated for FY 2013-14 projected overages in the Probation, $267,337, and the Jail, $81,606,
budgets); therefore the three department’s request a use of Public Safety fund balance in the
amount of $1.3 million in order to balance their FY 2014-15 budgets and of this amount $1.25 million
is from FY 2013-14 projected budget savings.

The new Juvenile Rehabilitation Facility is opened and received juvenile wards on January 25, 2014.
This budget requests funding to operate the new facility (which is more than twice the size of the
former facility and can hold up to 90 wards, as compared to 56) for the first full FY. Total FY 2014-15
requested appropriations will increase by 13.5 percent, or $588,230, from $4.37 million to $4.95
million. Salaries and Benefits will increase by 14.2 percent, or $403,869, from $2.84 million to $3.24
million, primarily due to a request to add two new Juvenile Detention Officer I/II positions (five were
added in FY 2013-14), but also increases in termination/special pay, extra-help, overtime, worker’s
compensation experience, and a one-time increase in Other Post-Employment Benefits. Services
and Supplies will also increase by 10.1 percent, or $144,855, due to increases in miscellaneous
insurance, office expense, professional & special services, special department expense,
professional counseling services, and professional administration. A-87 Central Services Charges
will increase by 40.8 percent, or $39,506, from $96,758 to $136,264. No new capital assets or
equipment are requested.
Requested revenues of almost $4.18 million will increase by 8.2 percent, or $315,573, from the FY
2013-14 Adjusted Budget, which is primarily due to a one-time risk management rate refund in the
amount of $394,434. Proposition 172 support has decreased by $207,475, or 21.9 percent, but
General Fund support has increased by $73,209 (3 percent) from $2.44 million to $2.51 million. The
department requests to use $780,511 in fund balance in their FY 2014-15 Requested Budget, of
which $180,752 is Youthful Offender Block Grant restricted fund balance, leaving a request of
$599,759. This budget was balanced in FY 2013-14 by using $569,645 in Proposition 172 Reserves
and is projected to end the FY on budget.
The CEO recommends increasing the Prop 172 support in the amount of $599,759 to balance this
budget.

The Department of Public Works consists of the following divisions: Facilities Management, Fleet
Management, Road Operations, and County Service Areas.
The FY 2014-15 Road Fund includes expenditures in the amount of $21.9 million and revenues in
the amount of $17.7 million. Expenditures exceed revenues by approximately $4 million and will be
covered by fund balance. Some of the larger projects that the department plans to undertake in FY
2014-15 are: Hawthorne Avenue Shoulder Widening, Dry Creek Road Widening, Smith Bottom
Road at ACID Canal Bridge Replacement, and Old Oregon Trail Left Turn Lane Addition. The
department is also adding an Assistant Engineer position to assist with the increase in water quality
mandates.
The Facilities Management Division is financed through charges for service to user departments
and does not receive General Fund support. The Division has requested that its singular Structural
Crafts Worker be reclassified to a Mechanical Crafts Worker. The Division will also be replacing the
asphalt shingled roof of their shop with a metal roof.
Effective July 1, 2013, the Facilities Management Division of Public Works took over the
management of all of the County’s fleet operations. Fleet had previously been managed by the
Department of Support Services. In order to reduce the Division’s retained earnings, rates charged
to departments that utilize Fleet’s services have been decreased.
The County Service Area Administration budget reflects the fiscal activit

adjunct departments. Building and planning activity is relatively stable and the department is
concentrating on several projects, including the General Plan. A General Fund contribution of
$455,000 is budgeted for the General Plan update. Fund balance will be utilized to offset any
revenue shortfall.
General Plan Update
By law, each California County must adopt and maintain a comprehensive, long-term general plan
that governs physical development and land use within its boundaries. Shasta County has adopted
a five year interval for review. The last comprehensive General Plan was adopted in 2004. On
March 23, 2010 the Board of Supervisors elected to proceed with a limited General Plan update
which will address the critical greenhouse gas requirement in a new air quality element and will
include the mandatory housing element update with integration of both elements into the rest of the
General Plan as needed. The update will include editorial updates to policy language and to County
profiles (population, economic trends, etc.). The total estimated cost of the limited General Plan
update is $552,000. Each fiscal year we increase the appropriation from General Revenue to
Planning to offset the expense of the update, but we only transfer actual expenses. To date,
approximately $40,500 has been spent on the update.
TITLE III PROJECTS
Title III was extended by Congress for FY 2013-14. Last year, it was anticipated that FY 2012-13
would be the last year for the Secure Rural Schools Act. With the extension, projects will be
awarded in July 2014. A budget amendment will be necessary to account for this extension. The
future of the Secure Rural Schools Act legislation is unknown.
TRIAL COURTS
The County worked closely with the City of Redding, the local Court, and the Administrative Office of
the Courts (AOC) on siting the new courthouse building. The County and the AOC executed a
Purchase Acquisition Agreement whereby the AOC exchanged its equity in the Main Courthouse
and Courthouse Annex, and the Justice Center, for the Public Safety Building. The agreement
allows each party to holdover in their respective buildings. The Adopted Budget includes $1 million
for activities related to relocating the Sheriff and the Probation Department from the Public Safety
Building. The start-date for construction of the new courthouse building has been delayed due to the
State budget. The CEO will work with the AOC to extend our holding over in the Public Safety
Building until, at a minimum, December 31, 2015. Future costs will include yet unknown expense to
relocate county-staff, although the CEO continues to research co-locating staff within available
County square footage. Upon completion of the new courthouse the Court will vacate the Main
Courthouse/ Courthouse Annex and Justice Center; the Department of Public Works has estimated
remodel of the Main Courthouse will cost upwards of $5 million.
VETERANS HALLS
Projects scheduled for FY 2014-15 include exterior painting of the Fall River Mills Veterans Hall,
parking lot re-striping and interior painting of the Burney Veterans Hall, and foyer door repairs of the
Redding Veterans Hall. In FY 2013-14 the heater at the Fall River Mills Veterans Hall was replaced.
organization, which provides operational and administrative support to the County Service Areas.
This budget unit is fully supported by administrative fees levied in the benefiting County Service
Areas.
RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
The Department of Resource Management consists of the following divisions: Air Quality
Management District, Building Division, Environmental Health Division, Planning Division and
Community Education Section.
Environmental Health is requesting, and the County Executive Officer supports the addition of an
Environmental Health Technician I/II to review Environmental Health permits and perform field work
that does not require a Registered Environmental Health Specialist certificate. The General Fund
continues to support one full-time Senior Environmental Health Specialist position that works on unreimbursed
community Environmental Health programs.
The Building Department serves as the code enforcement arm of the Resource Management
Department. This includes serving as the code enforcement officer for Medical Marijuana cultivation.
The Department is requesting, and the County Executive Officer recommends an increase in
General Fund support for the addition of an Agency Staff Services Analyst I/II and additional funding
for process service to address nuisance complaints generated by the cultivation of medical
marijuana. The Board approved the addition of a Building Inspector III in FY 2012-13 to address
nuisance complaints related to medical marijuana. The General Fund trans-in for the Building
Department has increased from $102,768 in FY 2012-13 to $264,011 for FY 2014-15.
The Planning Division serves as the land use information center for the County. This division of the
Department of Resource Management serves as an integral part of the “planning agency” for the
County, the agency being comprised of the Planning Commission, the Board of Supervisors, and 

adjunct departments. Building and planning activity is relatively stable and the department is
concentrating on several projects, including the General Plan. A General Fund contribution of
$455,000 is budgeted for the General Plan update. Fund balance will be utilized to offset any
revenue shortfall.

The Adopted Budget provides for a workforce of 1,927 full-time-equivalents (FTE’s). This includes a
net increase of 24 FTE’s. The sunset date for 2 positions will be amended; one is extended to June
30, 2015, and the other sunset date is removed. A new classification in the Health & Human
Services budget units, Fiscal Services Supervisor, is referred to Support Services-Personnel for
further study.
As of May 17, 2014, total vacancies were 211, or 11 percent. Some of the vacancies may be due to
the County’s Controlled Hiring Process. The CEO confers with Support Services weekly to review
all requests to fill positions. This is in part to reduce expenditures, but also to preserve positions for
employees facing a layoff situation.
The CEO will continue to review all requests for new positions to ensure they are offset by long-term
reliable revenue.

The Adopted Budget relies on $7.5 million of unallocated salary savings. This savings is realized
through normal attrition as well as by leaving positions unfilled. This mechanism allows departments
to submit balanced budgets pending resolution of yet unknown revenue shortfalls caused by the
State budget. Compared to Regular Salaries of $97 million, the unallocated savings is
approximately 8 percent. In the aggregate the anticipated savings are: Housing $34,157; General
Fund $249,292; Public Safety $1.1 million; and Health and Human Services $6.1 million.
EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
The cost of workers compensation insurance, CalPERS retirement, health insurance rate increases,
and retiree health care continue to impact the County. In March 2014 the Board of Supervisors
adopted a confidence level with a range between 80 to 90 percent for the County’s self-insured
workers’ compensation and liability insurance programs. The County is committed to maintaining a
prudent reserve.

COUNTY OF SHASTA BUDGET OVERVIEW, RECOMMENDED BUDGET FY 2014-15
Page - 21 -
The County’s employer share of CalPERS (“PERS”) retirement had already experienced volatility
due to the investment losses PERS experienced during the downtown in the market. In April 2012,
PERS announced an assumption change which included the reduction of the discount rate from 7.75
percent to 7.5 percent. Additionally, PERS changed other important benchmarks such as the
average mortality of retirees and their survivors. In April 2013, PERS announced a change in their
amortization and smoothing policies. That is, they will employ an amortization and smoothing policy
that will pay for all gains and losses over a fixed 30-year period with the increases or decreases in
the rate spread directly over a 5-year period. In March 2014, PERS again changed its actuarial
assumptions which will result in employer contribution rates increasing starting in 2016-17, with the
cost spread over 20 years with the increases phased in over the first five years and ramped down
over the last five years of the twenty year amortization period. Since 2010-11, on average the PERSMiscellaneous
rate increased less than 1 percent a year, and the PERS-Safety rate increased 2.5
percent a year. It is yet uncertain what impact pension reform will have on employee retirement.
The County successfully bargained reduced retirement benefits with labor, many of which are now
the state-norm. While beneficial to the County’s long-term fiscal health, these pension changes will
not realize an immediate financial benefit.
On the local level, the County has successfully negotiated with 9 represented bargaining units and 3
unrepresented bargaining units for wage and/or benefit concessions. Active employees now pay the
employee share of PERS retirement, and new hires will be working longer (to age 62 for
miscellaneous and 57 for public safety) and their retirement will be based on the average of high
three years (instead of highest year).
The County of Shasta provides post-retirement medical and dental benefits (OPEB) to eligible
employees who retire directly from the County. Eligible retirees pay a portion of the medical
premium based on the PEHMCA (CalPERS medical program) “unequal method.” The remaining
premium is shared by the County and active employees in accordance with bargaining agreements.
Like most governmental agencies, the County pays for these post-retirement benefits on a “pay-asyou-
go” basis. This means that OPEB costs are ignored while an employee renders service and
recognized only after the employee retires.
GASB 45 requires governmental agencies to conduct an actuarial valuation of the liability for OPEB
and report them on their financial statements. The Unfunded Actuarial Accrued Liability is the
excess of the Actuarial Accrued Liability over Plan Assets. This represents the amount of the
Actuarial Accrued Liability at the valuation date that still must be funded. The County’s estimated
Unfunded Actuarial Liability as of June 30, 2013, is $171 million.
Although GASB does not require governmental agencies to pre-fund their OPEB liability, Shasta
County is taking positive steps towards addressing OPEB. The County established two irrevocable
OPEB Trusts with initial funding of $6 million each; and implemented a charge, as a percent of
payroll, effective July 1, 2008. This percentage was increased to 2 percent effective July 1, 2013.
The combined assets of the two OPEB-Trusts, as of June 30, 2013, are $25 million. Additionally,
one-time additions to the OPEB-Trusts are made when funding is available; an additional $5.6
million will be transferred to the Trusts in July 2014.
We continue to advocate for legislative changes to PEMHCA to give counties greater flexibility in
establishing a tiered benefit system; and to work towards OPEB cost avoidance through labor
negotiations. Within available resources the County may incrementally increase the payroll charges
for OPEB to pass a portion of this expense to state and federal programs when appropriate.
