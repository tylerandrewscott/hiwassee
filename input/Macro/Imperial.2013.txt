The preparation of the 2013-2014 fiscal year budget began as usual in early
February approximately a month after the governor released his proposed budget for
the State of California. The Governor's budget of $96.3 billion, the third biggest ever,
that includes a $1.1 billion reserve, passed in both the House and Senate on June 14,
2013 by majority vote. While Governor Brown is expected to sign the budget before
July 1, the beginning of the new fiscal year; it is likely he will make some line item
vetoes.
The governor's budget includes new funding to help children of middle-class
families with tuition, childcare subsidies so that working families can continue working
and funding for dental services for the poor. In addition, there is funding to keep trial
courts open, more mental health funding and funding that provides a hand to welfare
recipients looking to jump to the middle class. All this while still beefing up K-12
education spending by billions of dollars.
Our proposed budget, which we submit to you today, as required by the State
Controller's County Budget Act, is also in balance at this time and relies on a carryover
balance similar to the Adopted 2012-2013 Final Budget of just over $10,000,000.
However, the development of the 2013-2014 budget was done in a manner different
than past years in that CEO budget staff were directed to use the 2012-2013 adopted
budget figures for each department while adjusting only for changes in salary and
benefit amounts either due to merit increases or benefit rate changes. There were
some increase or decrease changes made based on either funding, Board approval of
on-going contract costs or elimination of programs and or funding source.
Positives to the budget is that based on an estimate by County Assessor, Roy
Buckner, the tax assessment roll for 2013-2014 may see an increase of 3%,
approximately $390,000 as a result of renewable energy projects in Imperial County. In
addition, the Board of Equalization informed Mr. Buckner that Proposition 13
assessments will increase by 2%. Our Sales and Use Tax estimate also includes an
additional $1,000,000 in revenue over our normal budget figure of $3,000,000 based on
renewable energy project Public Benefit Agreements.

There is an augmentation included in our Proposal to Balance to fund a vacant
Juvenile Hall Officer position for $51,110. The position was approved for recruitment
after the salary worksheets for Probation had been completed and verified by Budget
and HR. This position had been vacant since 2012 and therefore not part of the salary
worksheets created and reviewed. Proposed funding of the position until the final
carryover fund balance is known would come from Revenue Stabilization Reserve if
necessary.
Therefore, we submit for your approval and adoption an overall County proposed
budget assuming the following:
Anticipated Beginning Balance:
Anticipated Revenue:
Total Available Financing:
Anticipated Expenditures:
$ 73,652,148
$345,986,844
$419,638,992
$353,864,900
The County General Fund proposed budget assumes the following:
Anticipated Beginning Balance:
(FY 2012-2013 Carryover)
Recommended General Fund Revenues:
Total Available Financing:
Recommended Expenditures:
Anticipated Surplus/Deficit:
$ 10,072,259
$205,760,489
$215,832,748
$215,832,748
$ - 0 -
The 2013-2014 Proposed Budget reflects 2,175 position allocations with 66
vacant funded and 318.5 vacant unfunded positions.
Should the Board decide to accept the proposed budget as presented, CEO
budget staff will then assist the Auditor-Controller's office in determining the actual
Carryover from FY 2012-2013. The Carryover balance should be determined by July
24, 2013. Thereafter, budget staff will work to finalize and prepare the budget for
Budget Hearings. We would expect the final budget to be completed by August 2, 2013
with budget hearings to begin on August 13, 2013. Final adoption of the budget is to
take place shortly thereafter.
Requested Action:
• Approve Proposed Budget and Proposal to Balance as submitted
• Schedule Budget Hearings to begin August 13, 2013
