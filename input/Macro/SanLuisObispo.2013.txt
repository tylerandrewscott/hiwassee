The Fiscal Year (FY) 2013-14 Proposed County budget is submitted for your review and
consideration. Your Board will review the budget in detail at public budget hearings, scheduled
for June 10 – 12, 2013, during which time you may add, delete, or modify the proposal as you
deem appropriate.
Introduction
This budget, as proposed by staff to your Board, is an effort to allocate scarce resources in an
effective and efficient manner in order to achieve the County’s vision of a safe, healthy, livable,
prosperous, and well governed community. This budget proposal complies with all aspects of
the State Budget Act (Government Code 29000 – 29144), Board adopted Budget Goals and
Policies, Budget Balancing Strategies and Approaches, and the Board’s priorities. All of these
guiding principles and strategies were utilized in an attempt to strike a balance between sound
fiscal management and the continued provision of programs and services to the public.
Striking this balance is as difficult as ever given the continued fiscal challenges facing the
nation, state, and our local communities.
This budget represents year six of the County’s seven year plan (commonly referred to as the
Seven Year Pain Plan). The intent of the plan is to incrementally and methodically close the
structural budget gap over a seven year period and maintain a high level of service to the
public. Your Board and County employees at all levels of the organization continue to do a
commendable job of implementing this plan as the structural gap is shrinking as envisioned.
FY 2013-14 represents year six of the Seven Year Pain Plan, which began in FY 2008-09.
The budget gap for FY 2008-09 was $18 million, $30 million for FY 2009-10, $17 million for FY
2010-11, $11.4 million for FY 2011-12, $2 million for FY 2012-13 and $2.2 million for FY 2013-
14. It was previously anticipated that FY 2009-10 would be the most difficult year from a
numbers perspective and this is holding true today. The structural gap is shrinking due to the
many actions taken by your Board and staff over the past five years. As you will note, the gap
for FY 2013-14 is slightly higher than the gap for FY 2012-13 but is within the range contained
in the forecast presented to your Board in October 2012.

The good news is that key economic indicators are showing signs of improvement. The
indicators include property, sales, and Transient Occupancy Taxes (TOT) as well as building
permits and planning revenue. In fact, the slight increase in projected property tax revenue
(2%) indicates a brighter outlook for the recovery of the local real estate market.
The Budget Gap
The budget gap for a Status Quo budget for the General Fund in FY 2013-14 is $2.2 million.
Generally speaking, a Status Quo budget is defined as one that takes current year staffing and
program expenditures and costs them out for the next year with no material changes (i.e.
inflationary increases only and no increases or decreases to staffing or program levels). It
also includes the reduction of grant funded programs and positions in instances where the
grants are no longer available.
This proposed budget includes the 2011 Public Safety Realignment (AB 109), whereby
responsibility for oversight of some prisoners and parolees transferred from the State to
counties. As a result, 28 positions were added mid-year to the FY 2011-12 budget (October
25, 2011) as was $4 million (annually) of associated revenues and costs. The transfer of
responsibility continues to have a significant impact upon the operations of the Sheriff-Coroner,
Probation, Health Agency, Public Defender, and District Attorney Departments. As reported
last year, the revenues appear to be generally approximate to the associated costs, however,
County staff will continue to keep a close eye on this balance for if revenues do not keep pace
with expenditures, this realignment could significantly increase the size of our budget gap.
In addition, there has been some discussion statewide as to whether the shifting of prisoners
and parolees to the counties has resulted in an increase in serious crime. There is some
anecdotal evidence to that effect, but others suggest it is too soon to arrive at a definitive
conclusion. The Public Policy Institute of California (PPIC) is proposing to perform a study to
assess the impact to counties as a result of Realignment. The suggestion is to examine 10
counties representing a cross-section of large and small, urban and rural. We made it known
to the PPIC that San Luis Obispo County would be willing to be one of the 10 test counties.
One of the primary reasons for the shrinking gap is the progress that continues to be made in
containing and reducing salary and pension costs. It’s been approximately three years since
your Board approved the “Three-Point Plan,” which includes a Tier 2 pension plan for new
employees, pension cost sharing for new and existing employees, and an updated approach to
setting salaries. As a result of the implementation of this plan, the County is saving over $26
million annually in labor costs.
In addition, the Public Employee Pension Reform Act (PEPRA) of 2013 became effective
January 1, 2013. The changes to public pension plans are applicable to all public employers
and the changes resulting from PEPRA, and approved by the Board of Supervisors, have been
incorporated into the San Luis Obispo County Pension Trust Plan, which is an independent
retirement system administered through the Pension Trust.
PEPRA is significant legislation for San Luis Obispo County as it imposes a new tier (Tier 3)
for employees entering service with San Luis Obispo County on or after January 1, 2013.
There are many facets to the PEPRA legislation, but for San Luis Obispo County it essentially
reduces retirement benefits below that of the existing Tiers 1 and 2 and increases the cost
sharing for employees who begin employment with the County on or after January 1, 2013. By
A-3
implementing Tier 3 and increasing the amount each employee contributes toward their
pension costs, the future fiscal liabilities for the County are progressively reduced as more new
employees enter into the system as Tier 3 employees.
Closing the Gap
The $2.2 million gap is closed by implementing the approaches contained in the Seven Year
Pain Plan referenced above. Consistent with the Board adopted budget polices, a combination
of short-term solutions and long term expenditure reductions are proposed to close the FY
2013-14 gap. The budget balancing strategies specify that as the Pain Plan progresses over
the years, an ever smaller portion of short-term funding is used to close the gap. The final goal
is to not rely on short-term resources at the conclusion of the Seven Year Pain Plan in FY
2014-15.
The target for FY 2013-14 is generally to use 10% of short-term funding and approximately
90% of long term solutions. The Proposed Budget for FY 2013-14 closes the gap consistent
with that target, although the short-term funding is slightly higher than 10%.
The $2.2 million of recommended expenditure reductions are in accordance with the priorities
provided by your Board. Meeting legal mandates, paying debt service, and public safety are
your Board’s highest priorities (in order). Also, this recommended budget allocates sufficient
funding in order to meet our legal mandates and to keep our creditors whole. Additionally, the
public safety departments are recommended for a higher level of funding as compared to most
other non-public safety departments.
It is important to note that while the budget gap continues to shrink, in order to close the gap
there will be reductions to programs and services, but the impacts are considerably less
compared to prior years. Latter portions of this budget message contain a summary of the
impacts and the departmental budget sections contain more detailed explanations.
The State Budget
In contrast to prior years, there is better financial news from the State. On January 10, 2013,
the Governor released his 2013-14 budget package and it reflects a significant improvement in
the state’s finances due to several reasons, as follows: 1.) The beginning of an economic
recovery; 2.) Prior budgetary restraint; and 3.) The voters’ approval of temporary tax increases
with the passage of Proposition 30. Passed in November 2012, Proposition 30 increases taxes
and, equally important to counties, constitutionally protects revenues associated with AB109
Realignment.
The Governor’s budget package projects General Fund revenues of $98.5 billion in 2013-14.
The budget also assumes $97.7 billion in General Fund expenditures, producing an $851
million operating surplus in 2013-14. Specifically, the Governor proposes $138.6 billion in
General Fund and special fund spending in 2013-14, up 4.5 percent from 2012-13. The budget
package estimates that the General Fund will end 2013-14 with a $1 billion reserve.
Generally speaking, a brighter fiscal outlook for the State is good news for counties. There is a
significant unknown related to the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), scheduled
for January 2014. At the time of this writing, it is still unknown how the ACA will procedurally
be implemented for California as it relates to the expansion of Medi-Cal. There are two options

under discussion at this time. The first option is one in which the counties take the lead in
implementation. In the second option, the State would be the lead. At this time it is speculated
that the State will take the lead role in implementation, but the details are unknown. In the
event the State is the lead in Medi-Cal expansion implementation, the prevailing belief
amongst counties is the State would look to reduce funding to the counties. The proposed FY
2013-14 budget for our county is structured as status quo until such time a decision is made
and details are forthcoming. Regardless of who takes the lead in implementation of ACA, it
more than likely will trigger a budget adjustment mid-year for FY 2013-14.
Summary of Expenditures
? The proposed FY 2013-14 budget for Total Government Funds is approximately $494.8
million, which is about a $4 million increase over the current year’s adopted budget
(reference the following chart for more detail). The primary reason for the increase is
the continued transfer of public safety responsibility and the associated costs and
revenues from the State to counties (commonly referred to as AB 109 public safety
realignment).
? The proposed General Fund budget is approximately $410.7 million, which is a $7.7
million increase compared to the current year’s adopted budget. Again, the primary
reason for the increase is the public safety realignment.
? Detailed information about budget changes can be found in the narrative information
provided for each fund center (please refer to the index for a listing of all fund centers).
The detailed information for each fund center includes a Department narrative as well
as a County Administrative Office (CAO) narrative. The former provides an overview of
key issues facing each department and the latter provides context to the numbers. The
approach in the CAO narratives is to convey what is changing from one year to the next
and the corresponding impacts to programs and services 

The Proposed Budget recommends 2,444.25 full time equivalent (FTE) permanent and limited
term positions. This represents a net decrease of two positions (-0.1%) as compared to the FY
2012-13 current year budget. All of these positions are vacant. It is worth noting that 24.00
positions were added mid-year FY 2012-13. The primary reason for the mid-year increase is
as a result of the 2011 Public Safety Realignment or grant funded positions.
It is also important to note that 13.5 FTE (87%) of the 15.5 FTE increase in positions are offset
by funding from the State and Federal government. The balance (2.0 FTE) are funded via
local funds for Veteran Services and for Code Enforcement (Planning & Building). Equally
important to note is the deleted 17.5 FTE are positions primarily funded through local
discretionary funds. This dynamic highlights the juxtaposition in which counties find
themselves. Counties are growing in the areas realigned by the State (i.e. transfer of
responsibilities from the State to the counties) and are still shrinking in the areas in which we
have local control.

Land Based Budgets – Net Decrease of 4.50 FTE positions:
The Land Based budgets are comprised of the Agricultural Commissioner, Planning and
Building, Community Development, Public Works Internal Service Fund (ISF), Public Works
Special Services, Roads, and Road Impact Fees.
Overall, General Fund support to the budgets within the Land Based functional area is
decreasing slightly, $236,767 or 1.5%, when compared to FY 2012-13 adopted levels.
Revenues, overall, are expected to increase by $1.5 million or 16.90% from FY 2012-13
adopted amounts for Land Based fund centers. This is primarily due to the $1.6 million, or
32%, increase in revenue budgeted for the Planning and Building Department.
Agricultural Commissioner
General Fund support for the Agricultural Commissioner is recommended to decrease $28,054
or 1%. Expenditures are recommended to increase $113,024 or 2%, primarily due to 2%
increase in salary and benefits expense. Revenues are recommended to increase by $141,078
or 4%, mainly due to a $99,777 or 12% increase in Federal revenue for the detection of
detrimental pests, especially the Asian Citrus Psyllid, based on a recent detection in Santa
Barbara County. Unclaimed Gas Tax revenue from the State is expected to increase $19,044
or 1%. In each of the past three fiscal years, San Luis Obispo County has submitted
documentation of economic hardship and obtained a waiver of this requirement, and has
continued receiving Unclaimed Gas Tax revenue. Based on the General Fund support
provided to the Agricultural Commissioner budget over the past five years, it is expected that a
waiver request will not be necessary in FY 2013-14.
Planning and Building
The level of General Fund support for Planning and Building is recommended to decrease
$125,404 or 2% compared to the FY 2012-13 adopted budget. Overall, recommended
revenues are increasing more than $1.6 million or 32% primarily due to the two large solar
plants under construction in the Carrizo Plain. An uptick in permit application activity is also
being seen as the County emerges from the recession. This increase in activity has also
influenced the increase in revenue, though to a much smaller extent than the large projects
noted above.
Recommended expenditures are increasing approximately $1.48 million or 13% compared to
the FY 2012-13 adopted budget primarily due to a more than $1.13 million increase in services
and supplies accounts. This increase is almost entirely in the professional services account,
and more than half of this increase ($750,000), is related to a contract with a firm to conduct
site inspections on the two large solar plants. Salary and benefit expenditures are increasing
$341,349 or 3% as compared to the FY 2012-13 adopted budget. Almost half of this increase
is due to the addition of two full-time Limited Term Land Use Technicians funded with
EnergyWatch grant funds in December 2012. In addition, the recommended budget includes
the conversion of 0.50 FTE Limited Term Resource Protection Specialist to a 1.0 FTE
Permanent Resource Protection Specialist to enable the department to meet its code
enforcement goals.
A-9
Roads
The recommended FY 2013-14 budget for Roads provides for a decrease of General Fund
support of $100,000 or less than 2% as compared to FY 2012-13 adopted amounts. Any future
reduction in funding for the pavement management program could have a negative impact on
the condition of County roads over the next 10 years. Projects for FY 2013-14 include the Tefft
Street/Highway 101 interchange and Buckley Road improvement projects, the River Road and
the La Panza Road widening projects. A complete listing of projects to be carried out by the
Roads division can be found in Fund Center 245 – Roads.
Public Protection – Net increase of 2.00 FTE positions:
The Public Protection Functional Area includes the Sheriff-Coroner, District Attorney (which
includes Victim-Witness), Child Support Services, Public Defender, Probation, County Fire,
Emergency Services, Animal Services, Waste Management, Grand Jury and the County’s
contribution to Court Operations. In keeping with the Board’s priorities, General Fund
reductions recommended for the Sheriff-Coroner, District Attorney, Probation and County Fire
are less than those recommended for most other departments. As in past years, the Board’s
intent is to give these four departments priority in the allocation of resources to ensure the
County continues to effectively protect public safety despite the financial hardships facing the
County in recent years.
The recommended General Fund contribution to Public Protection in FY 2013-14 is $74.9
million, an increase of $1.2 million dollars or 1.6% compared to the FY 2012-13 adopted
budget. Most of this increase is due to a $1million increase in General Fund support in FC 140
– County Fire, the result of an increase in planned expenditures for the replacement of fire
vehicles. The other significant contribution to the increase in General Fund support for Public
Protection is a $280,349 increase in FC 130 – Waste Management. This increase is primarily
due to a one-time revenue increase from the Los Osos Landfill designation to offset projects
budgeted in FY 2012-13. These projects are now funded with General Fund dollars.
Recommended revenues for the public protection budgets, totaling $57.8 million, are budgeted
to increase $4.6 million or 8% compared to FY 2012-13 adopted budget. Revenue from
Proposition 172, the half-cent sales tax dedicated to public safety, is on track to exceed the FY
2012-13 budgeted amount and is budgeted to increase in FY 2013-14 as well, by almost $1.8
million or 9%, compared to the FY 2012-13 adopted amount. Prop 172 revenue is allocated to
the Sheriff-Coroner, Probation, District Attorney and County Fire department and accounts for
$21.5 million or 46% of all revenue budgeted for these four departments.
A net addition of 2.00 FTE is recommended to be added to the Position Allocation List (PAL)
for Public Protection in FY 2013-14:
? -0.50 FTE Economic Crimes Officer position to reduce General Fund support in FC 132
– District Attorney
? +1.00 FTE Correctional Technician position in FC 136 – Sheriff-Coroner supported by
State SLESF/COPS revenue
? +0.50 FTE Emergency Services Coordinator position FC 138 – Emergency Services to
help meet new Federal requirements for nuclear power plant emergency planning 

+1.00 FTE limited-term Deputy Probation Officer III position FC 139 – Probation funded
by State funding received by the San Luis Obispo County Chiefs of Police to serve as a
liaison between Probation and city law enforcement for three years.
County Fire
General Fund support is budgeted to increase $1,093,646 or 8% for County Fire. The increase
is the result of an increase in planned expenditures for the replacement of fire vehicles of
$1,256,312 over the amount for similar expenses in the FY 2012-13 adopted budget. The
replacement of County Fire vehicles is funded from a budget designation set up for this
purpose. If these expenses were removed from the budget, the amount of General Fund
support recommended for FY 2013-14 would decrease $114,040 or 1% compared to the prior
year adopted budget. No service level impacts are expected to result from the decrease in
General Fund support.
District Attorney
General Fund support for the District Attorney’s Office in FY 2013-14 decreases $66,961 or
less than 1% from FY 2012-13. Revenues increase $263,145 or 4%. The biggest contributor to
the increase in revenue is Prop 172 (the ? cent State sales tax for public safety). This revenue
source is budgeted to increase $239,624 or 9% over the FY 2012-13 adopted level and
mitigates declining revenues in other accounts. Expenditures increase $196,184 or 1%
compared to the FY 2012-13 adopted budget as a result of increases in salary and benefit
expenditures. General Fund salary and benefits expense of $212,987 is offset by budgeted
reductions including salary savings of approximately 1.25% and the elimination of a vacant
half-time Economic Crimes Officer position. No service level impacts are expected from these
expenditure reductions. Three positions were added to the DA’s Position Allocation List in midyear
FY 2012-13: a 0.50 FTE Deputy District Attorney II position and a 0.50 FTE
Victim/Witness Assistance Coordinator position, both supported by AB 109 – Public Safety
Realignment funding; and a 1.00 FTE District Attorney Investigator position offset by an
increase in expected revenue from the DA’s Real Estate Fraud fee.
Probation Department
General Fund support for the Probation Department is recommended to increase $48,054 or
less than 1% over the FY 2012-13 adopted level. Revenues are recommended to increase
only $36,430 or less than 1% and total expenditures are recommended to increase $84,787.
Salary and benefits expense increase $595,353 or 3%. Nearly half of this is due to an increase
of $258,538 in workers compensation charges for FY 2013-14. Services and supplies
expenses decline $516,756 or 12%, mainly due to the elimination of $400,000 of expense
budgeted in the prior year for contract expenses associated with the Day Reporting Center.
This item was planned for FY 2012-13 but was not implemented. The offsetting funding from
AB 109 Public Safety Realignment revenue was redistributed by the Board of Supervisor in
mid-year FY 2012-13 to support priorities in other departments. The impact of the loss of this
revenue on the overall budget for Probation in FY 2012-13 is offset by increases in other State
funding sources, including a $281,478 or 9% in Prop 172 revenue, the ? cent sales tax for
public safety, resulting in a small net increase in overall revenue.
A-11
Three positions were added to Probation’s Position Allocation List in mid-year FY 2012-13: a
1.00 FTE Program Manager position to supported by SB 678 community corrections incentive
funding from the State; and a 1.00 FTE limited-term Deputy Probation Officer III position
funded by State funding received by the San Luis Obispo County Chiefs of Police to serve as a
liaison between Probation and city law enforcement for three years.
Sheriff-Coroner
General Fund support is budgeted to increase $182,248 or less than 1%. Total expenditures
are recommended to increase $2,296,272 or 3% compared to the FY 2012-13 adopted level.
Salary and benefits expenditures increase $1,829,940 or 3%. Approximately 40% of the
increase is due to an increase in workers compensation charges of $729,273. An additional
$313,941 is the result of four positions added in mid-year FY 2012-13: a 1.00 FTE
Correctional Technician position, a 1.00 FTE Department Automation specialist position, and a
1.00 FTE Program Manager position to support AB 109 - 2011 Public Safety Realignment; and
a 1.00 FTE Correctional Technician position supported by State SLESF/COPS revenue.
Services and supplies expense is recommended to increase $589,5041or 6% compared to the
FY 2012-13 budget. A substantial portion of the increase is $220,481 of increased expenses
for clothing and personal, food, household expense, and medical supplies resulting from the
growth in the jail population spurred by AB 109 Public Safety Realignment. Maintenance
contract expenditure increases, most of which are offset by State revenue, contribute another
$123,052 to the overall increase. Most of the remainder is a $177,527 increase in expenditures
for equipment replacement, including $47,160 for cell door replacements funded from the
Countywide Maintenance Fund.
Revenues are budgeted to increase $2,114,024 or 9% in FY 2013-14. The increase is due to
two main factors. The first is a projected increase in Prop 172 revenue (the State’s ? cent
sales tax for public safety), which is budgeted to increase $1,080,284 or 9% over the FY 2012-
13 budgeted level. The second is an increase in State Public Safety Realignment revenues,
which are budgeted to increase $1,157,960 or 9% overall.
Court Operations
The contribution from this budget to the General Fund is recommended to increase $359,098
or 319% compared to the FY 2012-13 adopted budget. The increase is due to rising revenues,
primarily those received from County Motor Vehicle/Criminal Fines, State Penalty
Assessments, Traffic School fees, and City Motor Vehicle Fines. This budget funds the
continuing County obligations to the California Superior Court. In the late 1990s, the State
passed the Trial Court Funding Act. This legislation revised the financial and operational
relationships between counties and courts by shifting the overall responsibility for court
operations to the California State Judicial Council. The financial arrangement that resulted
from the Trial Court Funding Act established a Maintenance of Effort (MOE) expense that
requires the County to pay a specified amount to the State of California, based on a formula, to
support Court Operations. Revenues received in excess of these budgeted expenses
contribute to the County General Fund.

Child Support Services operates almost entirely on revenue from State and Federal sources.
For several years, a minimal amount ($14,620) of General Fund support has been
recommended for this budget to offset some of the charges from the Sheriff’s department for
providing “service of process” –i.e., delivery of summons and complaints. However, in FY
2013-14, it is again recommended that the department not receive any General Fund support.
State and Federal revenue levels are consistent with FY 2012-13 adopted levels. Expenditure
levels continue to be down due to the reorganization of staff that occurred in FY 2012-13. To
date, it does not appear that the department’s reduced budget and the reorganization has
posed any service level impacts. To ensure that its performance isn’t impacted, the
department will continue to place a large focus on training and providing support to staff who
recently moved into new positions.
Health and Human Services – Net Increase of 7.0 FTE
The Health and Human Services (HHS) category includes Social Services, Public Health,
Behavioral Health, Law Enforcement Medical Care, Driving Under the Influence and Veterans
Services. Funding for community based organizations, indigent medical care and the County’s
contribution to the Community Health Centers for operation of outpatient health clinics is also
included in this area.
HHS programs are largely administered by counties on behalf of the State or Federal
governments. Historically, the State and Federal governments have not provided sufficient
funds to keep up with growing expenses. In doing so, they have put local governments in the
position of either cutting these programs or reducing other local services to pay for them.
During the recent economic crisis, the County has reduced expenditure levels in many of the
HHS budgets as our ability to make up the difference between rising costs and shrinking State
and Federal revenue with General Fund support has declined. It appears that the worst may
be behind us and this trend is beginning to reverse itself. This is in part a result of the 2011
realignment of funding sources and program responsibility of several health and human
services programs. The FY 2011-12 State budget and accompanying legislation included a
major realignment of public safety programs from the State to local governments. Several HHS
programs were realigned including mental health and substance abuse treatment programs,
Foster Care, Child Welfare Services and Adult Protective Services.
In the November 6, 2012 election, Proposition 30 was passed by the voters. Not only did this
initiative increase personal income tax rates on very-high-income Californians for a seven-year
period and increase the state’s sales tax rate by one quarter cent for four years, this measure
also put key provisions of the 2011 realignment of public safety, health and human services
programs into the State Constitution. These constitutional provisions ensure that counties will
receive on-going funding to support the programs that were realigned
In FY 2013-14, revenues of HHS programs increase approximately $6.3 million or 4% while
total expenditures increase more than $6.1 million or 4% compared to the FY 2012-13 adopted
budget. This results in a reduction in General Fund support of approximately $197,000 or 1%.
The most significant increase in General Fund support is in Behavioral Health largely due to an
increase in workers compensation charges and other variable benefit costs. The most
significant decrease in General Fund support is in the Foster Care budget, due to an increase
in Social Services Realignment revenue.
A-13
It is important to note that there are important changes that are expected to occur in the
coming year that have not been factored into the recommended budget. First, implementation
of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) is expected to occur during FY 2013-14 and is likely to have
significant implications for indigent medical care. The County should see a significant decrease
in expenditures for indigent health care once the majority of low income patients obtain health
insurance coverage, as early as January 1, 2014. However the exact amount is unknown and
potential reductions to State funding for indigent health care through the 1991 Realignment is
also unknown. Therefore the recommended budget assumes the status quo. Second, there
are two programs that will likely result in significant changes to the Behavioral Health budget
and potentially to the Department of Social Services budget. The first is the transition of
Health Families clients to Medi-Cal and the potential expansion of mental health services
required to serve this population. The second is a settlement of the Katie A. law suit which
sought to improve the provision of mental health and supportive services for children and youth
in, or at imminent risk of placement in, foster care in California. This may expand the mental
health services these youth are entitled to but the details of the settlement implementation are
still being worked out. Behavioral Health and the Department of Social Services are working
together to determine the potential costs and resource needs to address these two programs.
Staff will be bringing an item to the Board mid-year FY 2013-14 to provide more details on the
impacts of these new initiatives and request approval of needed position allocation changes as
well as budget adjustments to amend revenue and appropriation, as required.
Social Services
The overall level of General Fund support for the Department of Social Services is
recommended to decrease $349,467 or 5% compared to FY 2012-13 adopted levels. The
recommended budget for Social Services sets General Fund support at the minimum
contribution to leverage State and Federal programs that require matching funds from the
County.
The substantial decrease in General Fund support is due largely to changes in the way that the
In-Home Supportive Services (IHSS) program, which provides domestic and personal care
services to elderly, blind and disabled persons is funded. In FY 2013-14, the County’s share of
IHSS costs will be paid through a Maintenance of Effort (MOE) rather than being based on
caseload and authorized hours of care for elderly and disabled individuals. With the new
MOE, the County’s share of costs is capped and not impacted by an aging population. In
addition to the MOE, the implementation of a “Community First Choice Option” changed cost
sharing ratios and decreased the County’s share of IHSS costs from 17.5% to 15.4%. The
resultant savings from these changes have contributed significantly to the balancing of the
overall County budget.
In FY 2013-14, 7.0 FTE new positions are recommended to be added to the department's
Position Allocation List. The new positions include 3.0 FTE Social Workers, 1.0 FTE Social
Services Investigator, 2.0 FTE Program Review Specialists and 1.0 FTE Administrative
Assistant which will be distributed among the department's various programs to address
increases in workload. The addition of these new positions will not have any impact on the
department's level of General Fund support, as the incremental costs can be covered with the
department's existing allocations.

The Health Agency encompasses Public Health, Behavioral Health, the Medical Assistance
Program and the County Medical Services Program (both of which are indigent health care
budgets), Driving Under the Influence and Emergency Medical Services. In addition, Animal
Services is a division of the Health Agency, but is included in the Public Protection functional
group. The overall budget information that follows excludes the Animal Services budget.
Overall, total revenues for the Health Agency are increasing by approximately $3.2 million or
5% compared to the FY 2012-13 adopted levels. Total expenditures are increasing by
approximately $3.3 million or almost 4%. The recommended level of General Fund support
for the Health Agency is more than $16.27 million which is essentially flat compared to the FY
2012-13 Adopted Budget.
Behavioral Health
The recommended budget reflects an increase in revenues of approximately $1.7
million or 4%, an increase in total expenditures of more than $2.7 million or 5% and in
increase in General Fund support of $346,900 or 5% compared to the FY 2012-13
Adopted Budget. Several mid-year adjustments were approved by the Board in FY
2012-13, resulting in an increase of more than $2.56 million in revenue and
expenditures. These changes included an update to the Mental Health Services Act
and AB 109 plans, increases to the agreements with the Kinship Center and Family
Care Network, and other smaller adjustments. Compared to this adjusted FY 2012-13
budget, revenues are decreasing by $817,945 (2%) and expenditures are decreasing
$471,050 (less than 1%).
Included in the mid-year adjustments mentioned above was the addition of 10.00 FTE
associated with the MHSA and AB 109 plan updates, new mental health services for
Paso Robles School District and the conversion of temporary help to permanent staff at
the Psychiatric Health Facility.
One budget augmentation is recommended for Behavioral Health to increase one parttime
Mental Health Therapist IV to a full time position to increase outreach and mental
health services to veterans. This augmentation of staff and services was requested by
the Veterans Services Officer and will be funded with Mental Health Services Act
revenue.
Public Health
The recommended budget reflects a $999,225 or 5% increase in revenues, a $811,413
or 3% increase in total expenditures and a decrease in General Fund support of
$187,812 or 4% compared to the FY 2012-13 Adopted Budget. A portion of these
increases are due to Board-approved mid-year adjustments to the FY 2012-13 Adopted
Budget which added a total of $264,804 in revenue and expenditures and 3.0 FTE.
These mid-year budget adjustments were associated with increases in grant funding
from various sources such as the Nutrition Education Obesity grant, Office of Traffic
Safety grant and Public Health Emergency Preparedness grant.
Revenues are increasing primarily due to a net increase in Federal funding, a transfer of
Realignment Growth revenue from Department of Social Services trust, an increase in
Environmental Health fee revenue, and an increase in the California Children’s Services
allocation for FY 2013-14. Details are provided in the narrative for this fund center.
A-15
Total expenditures for this fund center are recommended at more than $21.7 million.
This reflects a reduction of $237,596 or 1% compared to the Health Agency’s requested
budget due a recommended reduction in General Fund support in the salary and benefit
accounts. The recommended reductions include the elimination of one vacant full-time
Public Health Nurse, which is expected to reduce service levels to low-income high-risk
pregnant women, first-time mothers and their infants. In addition, approximately
$162,000 in salary savings has been built into the recommended budget to reflect a
typical vacancy rate and Voluntary Time Off taken by Public Health department staff.
Law Enforcement Medical Care
Revenue is recommended to increase $359,185 or 61% and expenditures are
recommended to increase $312,390 or 14% compared to the FY 2012-13 Adopted
Budget primarily due to the AB 109 Public Safety Realignment revenue that was added
to the budget mid-year in FY 2012-13. Given the increase in the inmate population at
the jail and an increase in actual medical expenses, the Board approved an addition of
approximately $351,000 in AB 109 revenue to cover an increase of 1.5 FTE in
permanent staff and additional temp help as well as higher costs for pharmaceuticals,
medical supplies and contract physician hours.
A majority of the expenditure increase is in the salary and benefits accounts,
recommended to increase by $259,481 or 14%, reflecting the mid-year addition of the
1.5 FTE and additional temp help funded by AB 109 Realignment funds.
Recommended salary and benefit expenditures compared to the adjusted FY 2012-13
budget reflect a decrease of approximately $32,800 reflecting an assumption that the
law Enforcement Medical Care unit will realize a salary savings from vacant positions of
approximately 2%.
The level of General Fund support for Law Enforcement Medical Care (LEMC) is
recommended to decrease by $46,795 or 2% compared to the FY 2012-13 Adopted
Budget.
Indigent Medical Care
Funding for indigent medical care is included in two fund centers: the Medical
Assistance Program and the County Medical Services Program (CMSP). Costs for
indigent medical care appear to have leveled off after increasing significantly during the
recent economic recession.
As noted above, implementation of the Affordable Care Act is expected to have
significant implications for the indigent medical care budgets. The County could see a
significant decrease in expenditures for indigent health care once the majority of CMSP
patients obtain health insurance coverage, beginning January 1, 2014. The County may
continue to be legally responsible to provide health care for a residual indigent
population that cannot obtain coverage under Medi-Cal or Health Benefits Exchange.
Our current estimate is that this residual population may range from 500 – 650,
significantly less than the more than 3,200 clients currently served.

These changes have not been built in to the recommended budget due to the many
details regarding implementation approach, related expenditures and funding that have
yet to be worked out between the Governor, legislature and counties.
Veterans Services
The position allocation list includes an increase of 1.0 FTE for an additional Assistant Veterans
Services Officer (AVSO), noted above. This addition raises the total number of AVSOs to
three and the total number of departmental staff to five. The additional AVSO will help to
decrease the time between the filing of claims and the receipt of benefits. This addition
represents $60,766 of the $62,040 or 18% increase in General Fund support from FY 2012-13.
Community Services - Net Change of 0.0 FTE
Fund Centers represented in the Community Services functional area include Airports, Farm
Advisor, Golf Courses, Library, Parks, Fish and Game, and Wildlife and Grazing.
Airports
The Airport Services budget is an Enterprise Fund and as such is supported by revenues
generated through user fees. Excluding depreciation, the operating expense for FY 2013-14
is $3,391,628, an increase of $52.185 or 2% from the estimated amount or FY 2012-13.
Operating revenue in the FY 2013-14 budget is $3,398,415, a very slight increase of $8,739 or
less than 1%. Again this year, the Airport’s recommended FY 2013-14 budget identifies
expenditures exceeding revenues. The recommended budget identifies that the Airport plans
to use $268,000 of the $750,000 in Airport’s unrestricted cash balance to cover the gap
between expenditures and revenues. Although the Airport’s fiscal situation is more stable than
it was at the height of the economic downturn, the Airport’s long term fiscal stability will likely
depend upon the Airport’s ability to increase its revenues. Increasing passenger
enplanements and the ability to maintain and expand commercial air service at the San Luis
Obispo Airport is the key to revenue growth. There is a strong community demand for airport
services and Airport Management continues to work to increase commercial air service at the
San Luis Obispo Airport. The recommended budget maintains the current staffing and service
levels.
Parks
The total expense and total revenues for the FY 2013-14 Parks budget are recommended to
decrease by $1,000,526, or 10% as compared to the FY 2012-13 adopted budget. The level
of General Fund support is recommended to decrease by $479,378 or 11% as compared to
the FY 2012-13 adopted level $600,000 of the revenue and expenditure decrease and all of
the General Fund support decrease are related to the one-time addition of $600,000 in
General Fund approved as part of the final adopted budget for FY 2012-13. This one time
addition was made to assist Parks address deferred maintenance as well as support
improvements at County park and recreational facilities. Adjusting for the one time addition,
the General Fund support for this budget is increasing $120,622, a 3% increase. $80,000 of
this increase is a shift of General Fund from the Fund Center 113 General Services to Parks.
The shift in General Fund supports the grounds maintenance function that was transferred
from General Services to Parks during FY 2012-13. $27,500 in General Fund is being added
to this fund center to assist with marketing Parks campgrounds and facilities. $12,500 of these
funds is earmarked to assist with marketing County Golf Courses, Fund Center 427. Parks
revenues from fees are showing a slight improvement and the overall fiscal situation for the
A-17
Parks budget shows improvement as compared to the past several years. All existing staff
positions are funded and current service levels are maintained.
Golf Courses
The Golf Course budget is an Enterprise Fund and as such does not receive General Fund
support. Enterprise funds charge user fees for their services. During FY 2012-3, the number
of rounds played is showing a slight improvement and revenues are projected to be higher
than budgeted for the year. Golf operating revenues for FY 2013-14 are recommended for a
$66,720 or 3% increase over the projected revenues for FY 2012-13. Expenditure levels are
slightly less than revenues, and for the first time in several years, Golf will not have to use any
of its unallocated cash to cover its budgeted expense. A reduction in expense related to
countywide overhead charges is main reason for the improvement. The reduction in
countywide overhead expense is related to one-time adjustments and the relief created by the
reduction in this category of expense may not continue in future years. Maintaining a positive
fiscal balance will likely require continued improvement in the revenues derived from green
fees and other sources. The management for Golf is focusing on expanding the number of
golfers who use County courses. Management continues to use of promotions and marketing
activities to attract new clients. The recommended budget maintains current staffing and
service levels.
Library
The FY 2013-14 recommended budget for the Library reflects financing sources and
expenditures that are increasing $230,174 or 2%. General Fund support for the Library budget
is recommended at $607,139. This is an increase $91,018 of 17% over the FY 2012-13
adopted amount of $516,121 and represents 7% of the Library’s total budget of $8,665,045.
The Library is primarily dependent on revenue from property taxes to fund its operation.
Although the housing market remains sluggish, property tax revenues are budgeted to
increase approximately $200.000 in FY 2013-14, the first increase in five years. To achieve a
balanced budget, staff recommends cancellation of $100,000 in reserves, leaving a balance of
$932,331 in reserves. The recommended budget adds $100,695 to the materials budget, an
increase of 24% compared to the FY 2012-13 adopted budget. The recommended budget will
allow the Library to sustain current open branch hours
Fiscal and Administrative- Net decrease of 1.5 FTE positions
This functional area consists of the Administrative Office, Organizational Development,
Assessor’s Office, Auditor-Controller’s Office, Board of Supervisors, Clerk-Recorder’s Office,
and Treasurer-Tax Collector-Public Administrator.
Administrative Office
The level of General Fund support for this budget is recommended to increase $19,846 or 1%
compared to the FY 2012-13 adopted level. The increase in General Fund support is due
solely to a recommended one-time budget augmentation of $50,000 to cover the costs of hiring
a consultant to conduct an economic impact analysis of the Diablo Canyon Power Plant on
San Luis Obispo County. This recommended augmentation is included in response to
direction provided by the Board of Supervisors during a strategic planning session on February
19, 2013. If this augmentation had not been included, the recommended level of General

Fund support for the Administrative Office would be decreasing by $33,359 or 2% compared to
FY 2012-13 adopted levels.
Auditor-Controller
The level of General Fund support for this budget is recommended to increase $94,675 or 2%
compared to the FY 2012-13 adopted level. The increase in General Fund is due largely to
various salary and benefit adjustments resulting from the department filling positions at higher
levels in their career series’ than had previously been budgeted. These increases are partially
offset by the proposed elimination of 1.5 FTE positions. The FY 2012-13 adopted budget
included the addition of 2.0 FTE limited term positions to backfill for existing staff who will be
working on the Property Tax System Modernization project. In FY 2013-14, it is recommended
that 1.0 FTE limited term Accounting Technician position be eliminated, as the department has
determined that it does not need the position. In addition, it is recommended that a permanent
Auditor-Analyst III position be reduced from 1.0 FTE to 0.5 FTE as a budget reduction strategy.
It is not expected that the reductions to staffing levels will pose major service level impacts to
the community.
Support to County Departments- Net decrease of 5.0 FTE positions
This functional area consists of the Office of the County Counsel, General Services Agency,
including Fleet Services and Information Technology, Human Resources, Risk Management,
and the County’s Self Insurance programs. This functional area also included Reprographics,
which will be eliminated as of the end of the current fiscal year.
General Services
The level of General Fund support for this budget is recommended to increase by $224,766 or
3% compared to the FY 2012-13 adopted level. In FY 2012-13, the department shifted to a full
cost recovery method to determine charges to departments for services. This increased
departmental revenues by approximately $1.3 million, allowing for a concurrent reduction of
$1.3 million in General Fund support to the departments FY 2012-13 budget. However, the
department identified a calculation error in the methodology used to determine full cost
recovery resulting in the overstatement of revenues by $177,878, which impacted the change
in General Fund support in FY 2012-13 by the same amount. The recommended increase to
General Fund support in FY 2013-14 is due largely to this error.
The recommended budget includes reductions that decrease departmental expense by
$195,058. These reductions include the elimination of 2.0 FTE vacant Maintenance Mechanic
positions. The reduction of these positions may result in slightly longer response time to
emerging maintenance issues and some shifting of maintenance activities away from
preventative maintenance. The department identified the service level impact as minimal.
Other services will remain at current levels.
Information Technology
The level of General Fund support for this budget is recommended to increase $220,740 or 2%
compared to the FY 2012-13 adopted level. This increase is due largely to a decrease in
revenue received from the Superior Court for hosting the Court’s Criminal Justice Information
System on the County mainframe. Due to State budget challenges, the Court approached the
A-19
County with a request for relief from the approximate $440,000 in annual charges for use of
the mainframe. The County agreed to defer these costs in FY 2012-13 and FY 2013-14.
The decrease in revenue is partially offset by the recommended elimination of 1.0 FTE vacant
Senior Systems Administrator. The responsibilities of this position will be shifted to other
existing staff and as a result, it is not expected that this reduction will pose major service level
impacts.
Reprographics
In FY 2010-11 an independent consultant conducted a study and determined that the County
could reduce its print and copy costs by outsourcing those functions to a private vendor.
Based on this study, it was decided to eliminate Reprographics through a phased approach. In
FY 2012-13, a 1.0 FTE vacant Reprographics Technician was reduced from the department’s
PAL. In FY 2013-14, it is recommended that the remaining 2.0 FTE positions in Reprographics
be eliminated.
Overview of Financing/Revenues
State and Federal Revenue
State and Federal revenue at approximately $216 million, represent about 44% of the County’s
total financing. The recommended level is about $8.6 million more than FY 2012-13 adopted
budget, which is largely a result of the 2011 Health and Human Services Realignment funding.
State and Federal revenue is the single largest County revenue source. The majority of these
revenues are used to support statutory programs, such as health and welfare services and
some criminal justice programs. Generally speaking, these funds are restricted in use and are
not available for discretionary purposes.
Taxes
Property taxes, sales taxes, transient occupancy, and other taxes at approximately $150
million, represent about 30% of the County’s total financing. The recommended level is up
about $1 million as compared to the FY 2012-13 adopted budget.
Other Revenues and Financing
Other revenues at approximately $52 million represent about 11% of the County’s total
financing. The recommended level is approximately the same as the FY 2012-13 adopted
budget.
License/Permit Fees/Charges for Services
Licenses, permits, and charges for services at approximately $37.8 million, represent 8% of
the County’s total financing. The recommended level is $1.2 million or 3% higher than the FY
2012-13 adopted budget.

At approximately $5 million, this funding source represents about 1% of the County’s total
financing. The recommended level is approximately the same as the FY 2012-13 budgeted
amount.
Interest Earnings
At approximately $770, 000 interest earning represents about 0.2% of the County’s total
financing. The recommended amount is roughly the same as the FY 2012-13 budgeted
amount.
Fund Balance Available (FBA) and Use of Reserves
Fund Balance Available and the use of reserves represent the last two significant funding
sources for the total County budget. FBA is budgeted at $27.2 million (for all County funds not
just the General Fund) and represents approximately 6% of the County’s total financing and
the use of reserves at $4.3 million represents about 0.9% of the County’s total financing.
Reserves
The County has two types of reserves: general reserves and designations. General reserves
are not designated for a specific purpose. They serve to stabilize the County’s cash position
prior to the receipt of property tax revenues and more importantly provide protection against
downturns in the economy or against a major catastrophe if one were to occur within the
County. Designations are reserves that are set aside for specific purposes. These
designations help provide for the County’s long term financial needs.
In total, at the end of FY 2012-13, it is estimated that the County will have about $96 million in
total reserves and designations. Most of this amount is in designations for restricted and
specific purposes (i.e. not discretionary). For FY 2013-14, it is proposed that $4.3 million be
used to help fund the budget and that $11.1 million be added to the balances. The projected
balance at the end of FY 2013-14 is $102.7 million (a net increase of $6.8 million). Only
reserves and designations that are changing are included in the summaries below.
General Fund Reserves and Designations
The General Fund general reserve is recommended to increase $1 million to $9 million for FY
2013-14. It was last increased from $7.6 million to $8 million FY 2002-03.
Per the comprehensive depreciation and equipment replacement schedule, it is recommended
that $853,157 of the Fire Equipment Replacement designation be used in order to help fund
the replacement of Fire equipment. The new balance in the designation is projected to be
$113,765.
FB-2020 POB, a designation established in FY 2012-13 in order to help pre-pay some of the
County’s Pension Obligation Bond debt is proposed to be increased by $1.5 million. The new
balance in this designation is projected to be $6,188,657.
It is recommended that the Internal Financing designation be increased by $250,000 to $3.9
million.
A-21
Other (Non-General Fund) Reserves and Designations
Capital Projects: It is recommended that $50,004 of the Facilities Planning designation be used
to help fund capital projects recommended in the FY 2013-14 budget (reference capital
projects budget for the details). The balance in the designation is projected to be $6.2 million.
Additionally, $152,732 of the Los Osos Landfill designation is recommended to be used to help
fund work at the landfill. This will use all the remaining funds in the designation.
Roads: It is recommended that $944,564 be used to help fund the Roads budget. The
balance in the designation is projected to be $2.9 million.
Public Facility Fees (PFF): It is recommended that $616,700 of the County Fire PFF be used
to fund an expansion at the Meridian Fire Station and design work for a co-located dispatch
center, $380,000 of General Government PFF be utilized to help pay for debt service for the
New County Government Center and that $35,800 of Law Enforcement PFF also be utilized for
the co-located dispatch center. $326,500 is recommended to be added to the designations for
future use. This would result in a net decrease of $706,000. There are five different
categories of PFFs, which include general government, fire, public protection, library, and
parks. Please reference the PFF fund center (fund center 247) for more details.
County-wide Automation Designation: It is recommended that $569,875 be used to help fund
automation projects. The balance in the designation is projected to be $10.8 million.
Tax Reduction Reserves: It is recommended that $1,399,033 be added to this designation.
The balance in the designation is projected to be $13.5 million.
Traffic Impact Fees: It is recommended that $366,466 be used to fund Roads projects in areas
of new development. The balance in the designation is projected to be $4.5 million.
Driving Under the Influence: It is recommended that $5,600 of the General Reserve be used to
fund programs in this budget. Reference the Driving Under the Influence fund center (fund
center 375) for more details.
Library: It is recommended that $15,000 of the General Reserve and $85,000 of the Facilities
Planning reserve be used to help balance the Library’s operating budget. The use of these
funds would result in remaining balances of $34,690 and $692,510 respectively. Reference
the Library fund center (fund center 377) for more details.
Organizational Development: It is recommended that $95,787 be added to the General
Reserve, which would result in a balance of approximately $1.5 million.
Pension Obligation Bond (POB): It is recommended that $1,251,965 be added to this
designation in order to help pay for future pension debt service payments and for cash flow
purposes. The new balance will be $8 million.
Acknowledgements
Similar to prior years, I would like to thank all County employees for their hard work this past
year. There are several indicators that lead us to believe that general economic conditions are
improving. We are nearing the end of the Seven Year Pain Plan and the gap is being closed in 

accordance with the Plan. The improvement in the budget is a direct result of the many
policies and plans that have been created and implemented as well as the many sacrifices
made by all over the past five years. The entire organization deserves credit for the successful
progress towards the end goal of a sustainable budget.
I look forward to this next year as we continue to pursue our vision of a safe, healthy, livable,
prosperous, and well-governed community.
