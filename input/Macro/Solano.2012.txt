The FY2012/13 Recommended Budget for Governmental Funds totals $752,791,728 (Schedules 1 and 2). This amount
represents a decrease of $36.6 million, or 4.6%, when compared to the FY2011/12 Adopted Budget.
 General Fund totals $207,562,153, a decrease of $21.1 million, or 9.2%;
 Public Safety Fund totals $143,697,236, an increase of $6.3 million or 4.6 %;
 Health and Social Services Fund contains $269,005,706, a decrease of $2.9 million or 1.1%;
 Other Special Revenue Funds consists of $105,364,480, a decrease of $17.2 million or 14%;
 Capital Project Funds includes $6,844,625, a decrease of $2.1 million or 23.3 %; and
 Debt Service Funds total $20,317,528, an increase of $3.3 million or 1.4 %.
The Recommended Budget for Governmental Funds is financed by $51.2 million in Fund Balance, of which $32.6
million is from the General Fund. The General Fund Balance projection for FY2011/12 is slightly less than the ending
fund balance in FY2010/11 and should be considered an accomplishment, given the continued impacts of the recession
on County revenues and requests for various publicly funded assistance. The estimated FY2012/13 Fund Balance of
$32.6 million, coupled with the annualized ongoing reductions in operational expenses, will enable a balanced General
Fund FY2012/13 Budget. It is a testament to the year-round spending discipline exercised by the County Departments
and the hard choices made by the Board this year through the series of budget workshops focused on trimming the
County budget further, which enabled us to counter the losses of revenue and unanticipated program cost increases,
and prevent the size of the operational funding deficits in the General Fund, the Library Fund, and several other
operating budgets from increasing in FY2012/13.
The Recommended Budget provides for a workforce of 2,573.5 FTE positions, excluding extra help positions. This
reflects a net increase of 76.225 FTE from FY2011/12 Adopted Budget. The additional positions requested are related
to increases in service demands related to AB 109 Public Safety Realignment, health care reform and cost avoidance
measures, such as in Child Welfare Services and the Public Defender’s Office.
The FY2012/13 Recommended Budget uses prior-year savings, draws down from designated reserves but maintains
General Reserves to address the future, and relies on projected fund balances to fund County core services,
The Recommended Budget reflects a reduction in ongoing General Fund revenues of $174.2 million when compared to
the FY2011/12 Adopted Budget of $175.6 million. The reduction in General Fund revenues are related to lower interest
earnings, reductions in intergovernmental revenues and licenses, permits and franchise fees, and anticipated reduced
charges for services. Due to the State dissolution of Redevelopment Agencies in California, the County is uncertain if it
will receive the projected revenues from pass-through agreements, totaling $16.5 million in FY2011/12 and $16.5
million in FY2012/13. Currently, the successor agencies are submitting their Recognized Obligation Payment
Schedules (ROPS) to the State Department of Finance for final determination by June 1, 2012. It should be noted that
the Governor in his message with the May Revision Budget Report has proposed further program funding and program
administration changes as well as language to further clarify that obligations for former redevelopment pass-through
agreements between the redevelopments agencies and other taxing entities, such as the County, should be on the list
of Recognized Obligation Payments.
The Recommended Budget reflects reduced General Fund appropriations of $207.6 million compared to FY2011/12
Adopted Budget of $228.6 million. These reductions are related to the departments using Board-approved budgetreducing
strategies to decrease the overall cost of operations.
A Budget Summary narrative has been prepared and accompanied by a series of budget tables that are intended to
describe the budgeted expenditures and associated revenue used to fund the programs and services in the budget
units. The Recommended Budget narrative provides the following department information: the purpose; function and
responsibilities; significant challenges and accomplishments as identified by the department head; workload indicators
(where pertinent and relevant); a summary of significant adjustments to the operation or budget; summary of position
changes; and identification of pending issues and policy considerations as identified by the Department Head.
This is the second year that the Recommended Budget document was prepared early in the month of May to facilitate a
May release and longer review period prior to Budget Hearings in June. To accommodate the earlier release, we have
reflected in the department budgets only the known and approved State and Federal programs changes as of May 1,
which will take effect July 1, 2012. Other issues are noted in pending issues as state uncertainties.
Historically, the County Administrator’s Office prepares a Supplemental Budget document following the completion and
distribution of the Recommended Budget, as more of an administrative function, primarily to address accounting
notations. To the degree possible, the Supplemental Budget may reflect additional program and service changes
including possible reductions that can be expected based on the Governor’s May Revision released on May 14, 2012.
Unfortunately, we do not know the speed in which the California State Legislature will act on the Governor’s proposals
in the May Budget Revision. Given the State’s projected structural deficit of at least $15.7 billion, there remains a lot of
uncertainty and unknowns that could significantly distress the County’s FY2012/13 budget and several other
operational budgets. If this materializes in the coming weeks, the CAO and County Departments will return to the
Board with additional budget recommendations.
The FY2012/13 Recommended Budget addresses known revenue challenges and proposes reductions and
adjustments in operating expenditures to address these challenges, while allowing for some continued investments in
technology, training, and capital renewal. It still relies on one-time funding to close the operational funding deficit in the
General Fund, the Library Fund and several other operational budgets, which will require further cost containment
efforts in the coming year. As Washington, D.C., and Sacramento grapple with the consequences of a prolong
recession, a sluggish economic recovery and continuing budget deficits – given the range of budget-balancing concepts
being debated – we, locally, await the consequences of the resulting actions. What is certain is that County
Department Heads and the Board can anticipate the need for continued discussions and the potential for further
reductions in programs and services in FY2012/13.
