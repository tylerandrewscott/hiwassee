Submitted for your consideration and adoption is the Fiscal Year 2015-16 Recommended Budget,
prepared in accordance with your adopted Budget Policies. You are scheduled to begin public
hearings for all General Fund, Special Revenue Fund, Internal Service, and Enterprise departments on
June 15th and to adopt the budget on June 23rd.
The County continues to experience growth in a number of discretionary revenue sources including
property taxes, sales tax, and transient occupancy tax. Staff projects limited growth in property taxes,
the County’s largest discretionary revenue source. Property values are expected to continue to
increase, although at more moderate rates when compared to pre-recession highs. Because concerns
remain about the timing and sustainability of the improved economic conditions, the Recommended
Budget generally maintains General Fund programs at their current staffing and funding levels.
The Recommended General Fund Budget includes a $2.48 million (1.3%) increase in appropriations
compared to the FY 2014-15 Adopted Budget. This increase mainly results from salary and benefit
increases associated with negotiated Cost of Living Adjustments (COLAs) and a $5 million increase in
appropriations specifically for earthquake response and recovery. The increases are offset by a $7.3
million reduction in the projected transfer of excess Education Revenue Augmentation Fund (ERAF)
revenue to the Capital Projects Fund (Accumulated Capital Outlay division). When the budgets are
compared without the transfer of excess ERAF and earthquake recovery appropriations, the FY 2015-16
Recommended General Fund budget is slightly lower than the previous year (-0.3%). Negotiated
COLAs for Deputy Sheriff’s Association (DSA) and Napa Association of Public Employees
(SEIU/NAPE) employees, scheduled step increases, increased employee benefit costs, and other
operating cost increases are offset by decreases in Public Works projects and a $4 million decrease in
use of Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement funds that were transferred to the Capital Projects Fund
in FY 2014-15 to fund a portion of the remodel of the South County Campus for the Health and Human
Services Agency (HHSA).
The Recommended Budget reflects the elimination of 3 vacant positions and the addition of 8 full time
and 2 part time (0.5 FTE) positions. Recommended new positions and their funding sources include:
3.0 FTE District Attorney Investigator in District Attorney – Funded by General Fund net of
savings from Extra Help.
1.0 FTE Sergeant in the Sheriff’s budget – Funded by General Fund
1.0 FTE Account Clerk I/II in Corrections – Funded by Inmate Welfare Fund (15%) and General
Fund (85%)
3.0 FTE Correctional Officer in Corrections – Funded by General Fund
1.0 FTE (2 – 0.5 FTE) Office Assistant II in Planning, Building and Environmental Services –
Funded by General Fund and Fee Revenue
BUDGET PROCESS
The FY 2015-16 budget process began January 6, 2014, when your Board approved the FY 2015-16
Budget Policies and Calendar. Other steps in the process included:
• January 8th: Budget Orientation/Training for all departments.
• February 25th: Departments submitted their budget requests to the County Executive Office.
• March 17th: A Mid-Year Review of the FY 2014-15 budget status was presented to the Board.
• April 1st: CEO Analysts completed their initial review of departmental budget requests.
• April 21st: The Assistant CEO presented preliminary FY 2015-16 General Fund budget
projections and your Board held a Budget Study Session to provide input into the
Recommended Budget.
• New this year, the budget book includes selected Community Indicators and Performance
Measures in each Functional Area section. As discussed at the January 6, 2015 Board of
Supervisors meeting, the Performance Measures report for FY 2013-14 was delayed a year due
to the extra workload caused by the August 24, 2014 earthquake. Including selected
performance measures along with budget narratives provides an interim look at how County
services were performed. The full Performance Measures report will resume after the close of
FY 2014-15 and will incorporate data from both FY 2013-14 and FY 2014-15.

BUDGET POLICIES
As mentioned above, in January of this year, your Board adopted a set of Budget Policies to guide staff
in preparing the FY 2015-16 Recommended Budget. Using these policies as well as principles outlined
in the County’s Strategic Financial Plan, the General Fund budget is balanced and should remain
structurally balanced in coming years. Significant uncertainties remain regarding the continued
strength of the real estate market and its impact on property taxes, as well as growth in transient
occupancy and sales taxes. Excess ERAF, which has been a major source of revenue for the past several
years is no longer a viable revenue source due to State school financing changes. Use for ongoing
General Fund operations is discontinued beginning in FY 2015-16. In alignment with the policies, the
General Reserve and the Designation for Fiscal Uncertainty were fully funded in the current fiscal year.
To address response and recovery needs due to the August 24 earthquake, your Board authorized the
use of up to $13.9 million in General Reserve. Consistent with the policy, any FY 2014-15 revenue in
excess of expenditures and the amount needed to support FY 2015-16 budgeted appropriations will be
recommended to be used to rebuild the General Reserve to its policy level in advance of insurance and
FEMA/CalOES reimbursements.
Current policy guides that an Appropriation for Contingency is included in the budget at a minimum
of three percent of General Fund and Health and Human Services Fund appropriations. The
Appropriation for Contingency of $5,710,000 is included in the Recommended FY 2015-16 budget, fully
meeting the policy-level requirement.
The County’s Recommended All Funds Budget for FY 2015-16 totals $493,348,932 in appropriations.
This is a $25.3 million, or 5.4%, increase in appropriations compared to the FY 2014-15 Adopted Budget
appropriation level. A detailed comparison of the FY 2015-16 Recommended Budget’s appropriation
levels to the FY 2014-15 Adopted Budget follows:

In addition to the $2.48 million increase in the General Fund budget as described previously, the
primary reasons for the increase in the All Funds Recommended Budget compared to the FY 2014-15
Adopted Budget include:
• Increases in salaries and benefits resulting from negotiated memoranda of understanding with
the Napa Association of Public Employees (SEIU/NAPE) implemented in November 2014. In
addition, increases occurring in FY 2014-15 of 2.8% and 0.1% were not included in the FY 2014-
15 budget. An increase of 2.75% is scheduled for the first pay period of FY 2015-16. Thus the
FY 2015-16 budget reflects the effect of two years of increases. The estimated total cost of these
raises across all County budgets is approximately $5.9 million.
• A $26.3 million increase in Operating Special Revenue Funds appropriations based on the
following:
o Approximately $13.5 million in new or expanded Roads projects, including repair of
Silverado Trail between Dunaweal and Larkmead. The Roads Operations and
Maintenance (Division 20400) budget includes a transfer of more than $6 million to the
Roads Capital Improvement Projects (CIP) budget (Division 20405), causing the amount
to be budgeted a second time as part of the Roads CIP budget. Thus, the combined
effect on the budget is an increase of $19.5 million. Roads projects are described in more
detail in the Capital Improvement Projects section.
o Approximately $7.4 million in increased appropriations in HHSA. A portion of the cost
is related to negotiated COLAs as mentioned above combined with normal step
increases. In addition, an increase of approximately $2.5 million in the Health Care
Enhancement Program budget (Division 20007) reflects the transfer of funding to the
state required as match dollars necessary to participate in the Inter-Governmental
Transfer (IGT) funding program. The dollars are returned to the County when the IGT
revenue is received.
• A $4.8 million decrease in the Tobacco MSA/Special Projects budgets due to a one-time use of
funds used for improvements to the South County Campus transferred in FY 2014-15 and not
repeated in FY 2015-16.
• A $2.1 million increase in Non-Operating Special Revenue funds due to the transfer out of
special purpose funding resulting from increased revenue or use of fund balance for specific
programs.
• Internal Service Funds include Information Technology Services, Fleet Management,
Employee/Retiree Benefits, and Liability Insurance. Internal Service Fund overall
appropriations are projected to increase by $1.9 million. The majority of the increase is related
to Other Post Employment Benefits (OPEB). OPEB saw a significant increase in the budget year
due to actuarial changes extending mortality projections and eliminating an “implied subsidy”
for retiree health care. Retiree health care costs are “subsidized” by lower utilization by
younger, non-retired employees, so the Governmental Standards Accounting Board (GASB)
required that OPEB valuations be adjusted to phase out the subsidy, thereby more accurately
reflecting the true cost of retiree health care. The Liability Insurance budget increased by nearly
$300,000 to reflect expected premium increases. It is important to note, however, that the cost
increase is unrelated to the August 24, 2014 earthquake. In future years, insurance premiums
may increase due to experience.
The County’s Recommended General Fund Budget appropriation level for FY 2015-16 totals
$196,030,725. This is an increase of $2.48 million or 1.3%, compared to the FY 2014-15 Adopted Budget
appropriation level. A more detailed comparison of the FY 2015-16 Recommended General Fund
Budget to the FY 2014-15 Adopted General Fund Budget follows:
The primary reasons for the increase in both revenues and expenditures in the Recommended Budget
compared to the FY 2014-15 Adopted General Fund Budget include:
• The FY 2015-16 Recommended Budget reflects decrease of $495,230 (0.4%) in Discretionary
Revenue compared to the FY 2014-15 Adopted Budget level, largely the result of a reduction in
excess ERAF. Changes in budgeted revenue as compared to FY 2014-15 are:
o $2.4 million (4.7%) increase in Secured Property Tax revenue;
o $850,000 (5.3%) increase in VLF Swap Property Tax revenue;
o $430,000 (17.5%) increase in Triple Flip Property Tax revenue;
o $730,000 (48.7%) increase in Current Year Supplemental Property Tax revenue;
o $645,000 (9.3%) increase in Sales and Use Tax revenue;
o $876,000 (7.6%) increase in Transient Occupancy Tax (TOT) revenue; and
o $9.8 million (83%) decrease in excess ERAF.
In forecasting discretionary revenues for FY 2015-16, current year estimated revenue, rather
than Adopted Budget, is used as the basis for projection. Property Taxes were assumed to
increase by 4% from the current year estimated revenue; in FY 2016-17 by 4%; and in FY 2017-18
to 2019-20 by 5% annually. Sales tax was assumed to increase by 3% annually from current year
estimates for each of the five forecasted years, and Transient Occupancy Tax was assumed to
increase by 4% annually during the same five-year period. Future revenue assumptions are
based on continued economic growth and moderately escalating property values. In alignment
with direction from your Board, the FY 2015-16 Requested Budget assumes excess ERAF used
for operations is eliminated. Therefore, all excess ERAF will be transferred to the Accumulated
Capital Outlay Fund to be set aside for capital projects including construction of a new jail. Due
to the strength of the overall California economy and the Proposition 98 school funding
guarantee, it is unlikely that any excess ERAF will return to the County after FY 2015-16.
• Proposition 172 sales tax revenue for Public Safety is considered semi-discretionary as it may be
shifted between public safety functions. In the current fiscal year Proposition 172 revenue of
$14.4 million is expected, approximately $575,000 above budget, which includes a one-time
adjustment of $226,000. For FY 2015-16, a growth factor of 3% is assumed exclusive of the onetime
adjustment. This is consistent with other estimated sales tax growth.
• An increase in Housing and Intergovernmental Affairs of $1.4 million reflects the transfer of
Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds to build water storage tanks in the Lake
Berryessa area.
• A $1.5 million increase in the Appropriation for Contingencies. In FY 2014-15, the
appropriation was reduced to support costs in the Corrections budget to relocate inmates
during a significant construction project. The project did not materialize due to the earthquake,
and projected department expenditures for FY 2015-16 do not include this cost.
• A decrease of $7.3 million in General Expenditures to reflect a significant reduction in excess
ERAF, which by Board of Supervisors’ policy is transferred to Accumulated Capital Outlay
(ACO).
• An increase of $5 million for earthquake related expenditures.
• An increase of $1.6 million in appropriations in the Sheriff’s budgets reflecting negotiated wage
increases and funding for equipment and software to begin implementation of a body-worn
camera pilot project.
• A reduction of $6.2 million in Public Works projects reflecting a decrease in planned projects for
FY 2015-16.
FUND BALANCE, RESERVES AND DESIGNATIONS4
The Recommended General Fund Budget assumes a FY 2015-16 beginning fund balance of
approximately $51.7 million, a decrease of approximately $12.4 million, or 19.3%, from the FY 2014-15
actual beginning balance level5. The $51.7 million beginning balance is comprised of:
• $10.4 million in General Reserves. This represents approximately 3.9% of General Fund and
Health & Human Services Fund appropriations, not including the operating contingency, the
General Fund transfer to the Health & Human Services Fund and any transfer to the ACO
Fund. This balance reflects the authorized use of $13.9 million in General Reserve to support
the cost of earthquake response and recovery in anticipation of reimbursements from insurance
as well as FEMA/CalOES. Board Policy calls for maintaining the General Reserve at 10% of
appropriations, net of the exclusions mentioned above, and General Reserve is funded before
other use of excess revenues. Therefore, any excess revenues in both FY 2014-15 and FY 2015-16
will go first to restore the General Reserve to the policy level. Earthquake-related
reimbursements in future years will go to the General Fund provided that the General Reserve
is fully funded. The Recommended Budget adds $2.0 million to General Reserves.
• $3.6 million in a Reserve for Loans and Advances Receivable. This represents funds owed to
the County by the Napa Berryessa Resort Improvement District (RID).
• $28.4 million “assigned” (or designated) for various purposes. This includes $24.6 million
assigned for Fiscal Uncertainties, which represents approximately 10% of General Fund and
Health & Human Services Fund appropriations as described above. At the Recommended
level, the budgeted Designation for Fiscal Uncertainties will be approximately $2.1 million less
than the amount necessary to meet the Board’s goal (10% of appropriations as described above)
for this designation. Because of the need to restore the General Reserve, the Fiscal Uncertainties
may not be fully funded in the budget year. The assignments also include $1.5 million for
future Affordable Care Act (ACA) costs. In this Recommended Budget, a portion of the $1.5
million originally set aside by the Board is being used to fund a full time Human Resources
Assistant dedicated to tracking and analyzing data associated with ACA to ensure County
compliance. This position was originally planned for FY 2014-15, but is not expected to be filled
until late in the current fiscal year. Approximately $2.2 million is assigned for other designated
purposes or encumbered in various departments.
• The “available” balance of $9.5 million, which can be used to fund County programs. It is
important to keep in mind, however, that the above fund balance number is only an estimate.
The Auditor-Controller will determine the final fund balance number in the first quarter of FY
2015-16. Any revision to the Adopted Budget will be scheduled for your Board’s consideration
once the actual fund balance numbers have been established. If additional fund balance is
identified at that time, staff will recommend that it first be utilized to increase the General
Reserve.
SIGNIFICANT ISSUES
As the economy has improved over the past few years, the County has continued its prudent
budgeting practices in order to maintain structural balance. With the Board’s leadership, the County
adopted and has followed Budget Policies that have preserved a solid fiscal foundation. As the
economy continues to grow it is important for the County to address a number of significant unmet
needs and plan for expected increases in future pension and health care costs. The following issues will
need to be addressed in future fiscal years:
1. Roads: Public Works staff has identified the need for approximately $9.1 million dollars per
year in order to maintain a 70% Pavement Condition Indicator (PCI) on 416.8 miles of roadway.
The FY 2015-16 Recommended Budget includes $2,612,000 in General Fund appropriations for
this purpose. In line with your direction, this amount will increase to $3.2 million in FY 2016-
2017 and by an additional $560,000 the following year until the final General Fund
appropriation reaches $3.7 million in FY 2017-2018, the year before Measure T funds will
become available. Between Measure T funds, funding from outside sources, and the General
Fund contribution, revenues are estimated to equal the $9.1 million projected cost. Further
study will be needed to determine the ongoing cost to maintain the 70% PCI standard.
2. Capital Infrastructure Needs: The County continues to face many challenges as a result of aging
facilities. The acquisition of the new HHSA campus in December 2013 and the renovation that
will take place during FY 2015-16 will add new, more modern space to address future service
levels. Construction of a new jail remains a very high priority. Later this year, the County will
submit an application for $20 million in jail funding through the SB 863 process. The estimated
total cost is $60 million to construct a 96-bed facility that can be expanded during future
construction phases. The remaining $40 million will come from existing funding set aside in
Accumulated Capital Outlay, release of the Fiscal Uncertainties designation as the Health and
Human Services Fund builds up a separate Fiscal Uncertainty reserve, and, potentially, from the
sale of existing County real estate assets. It is important to note that the $60 million does not
include increases in ongoing operational costs associated with the new jail, particularly as a
split facility.
In addition, there are a number of costly renovations that need to be made on the County’s
remaining buildings which include: the Administration Building, Hall of Justice, Carithers,
Juvenile Justice Center, and Sheriff facility, exclusive of earthquake-related repairs. In the
County’s Five Year Capital Improvement Program covering Fiscal Years 2013-2014 through
2016-2017, the Public Works Department identified $132 million in capital projects. In coming
years, staff will need to develop a financial strategy to address these growing infrastructure
needs.
3. Employee Pension Costs: The County has made concerted efforts to proactively pay for
employee pension costs in a responsible manner. In addition, CalPERS has made significant
changes in amortization and smoothing policies and actuarial assumptions that will help
agencies address unfunded liabilities in a proactive manner. However, these changes will also
have significant financial impact on employer contribution rates in the coming years. In
February, the CalPERS Board of Administration voted to revise actuarial assumptions for
expected changes in retiree mortality, reflecting longer life expectancy. In addition in April
2013, the Board voted to revise average investment earnings assumptions, amortization and
smoothing policies in an effort to reduce market volatility. These assumption changes, which
go into effect beginning in FY 2015-16, will result in near and long term cost increases for
retirement benefits. Due to the assumption changes, combined employer/employee CalPERS
rates for miscellaneous employees are expected to rise from 25.8% in FY 2015-16 to 32.2% in FY
2020-21. Combined employer/employee CalPERS rates for safety employees are expected to rise
from 38.1% to 43.6% during the same period. The impact on the County budget will be less
than the impact on many of our neighboring cities and counties since the County shares rate
increases and decreases on a 50/50 basis with employees.
4. Use of Extra Help: Changes in laws have significantly affected the County’s use of extra help
(temporary, part time) staffing as an alternative to full time employees for limited term or
seasonal employment. In addition to the requirement to provide health insurance under the
Affordable Care Act, over the next two years, employers will have to provide paid sick leave
and family leave to part time employees meeting certain criteria. Combined with the changes
regarding the use of retirees, use of extra help employees is becoming more administratively
cumbersome and costly. Therefore, the Recommended Budget includes new positions to
implement a phase-out of extra help use where appropriate.
5. Other Post-Employment Benefits (OPEB): The County’s unfunded OPEB liability as of the June
30, 2013 valuation and using market value of assets at December 31, 2014 is $31.5 million. In the
last six years, since the Board adopted a policy to fund the OPEB liability, the County has
reduced its obligation by more than 50%. An actuarial assumption change removing an implied
health insurance subsidy for retirees increased the liability significantly. Had that not occurred,
the County’s plan would be 74% funded. The County will be contributing 7.8% of pay in the
Recommended Budget or approximately $8.3 million toward paying down this liability over the
next 14 years.
Given these issues and other fiscal risks the County may be facing, staff believes it would be prudent to
continue to be cautious, to control costs and to avoid major new investments in operating (non onetime)
programs. At the same time, given the nature of the General Fund’s fund balance and the
consideration and planning reflected in the County’s adopted Strategic Financial Plan, the County is
well positioned to respond in a careful and thoughtful way to the impact of an unexpected and
significant downturn in the economy.
OVERVIEW OF THE RECOMMENDED BUDGET
The following are some of the key issues associated with the FY 2015-16 Recommended Budget:
County-wide Issues
• As noted above, employee salary and related benefit cost increases are due to cost of living
adjustments, benefit increases and step increases.
• Consistent with the Board’s adopted Budget Policies, the Recommended Budget reflects
payments necessary to fully fund the County’s Other Post-Employment Benefit (OPEB)
unfunded liability on a 20-year amortization schedule. The Recommended Budget includes
contributions of 7.8% of pay or approximately $8.3 million toward paying down this liability
over approximately the next 14 years.
• The County continues recovery efforts related to the August 24, 2014 earthquake. In January,
the Board approved use of up to $13.9 million from the General Reserve to support the cost of
response and recovery efforts until reimbursements are received from insurance and
FEMA/CalOES. For FY 2015-16, an additional $5 million in appropriations is included in the
General Fund budget, reflective of anticipated costs in the budget year. However, that amount
is an estimate, and it will be necessary to adjust the budget later in the year as more is known
about the cost of reconstruction of damaged County buildings.
General Administration/Finance
The recommended General Administration and Finance All Funds budgets reflect total appropriations
of $106,612,703, an increase of $996,067; and total revenue of $162,505,722, an increase of $10,781,309. In
terms of the General Fund, Net County Cost for General Administration and Finance functional areas is
budgeted to decrease by $1,344,572. The following summarize the significant changes to the General
Fund budgets:
• The Human Resources Division of the County Executive Office has an increased Net County
Cost of approximately $87,000 primarily due to negotiated salary and benefit increases and
increases in recruitment costs and other hiring activities such as testing.
• The Appropriation for Contingencies has increased by $1.46 million for a total of $5.71 million.
This is consistent with Board of Supervisors’ policy to set aside a minimum of 3% of General
Fund appropriations for significant, unforeseen occurrences.
• Housing and Intergovernmental Affairs expenditures are increased primarily to reflect $1.5
million in CDBG funds that will be used to replace aging water tanks in the Lake Berryessa
area.
Non-Departmental budget units are as follows:
• The General Expenditures budget is decreased by approximately $5.7 million, primarily to
reflect the reduction in anticipated transfer of excess ERAF funds to Accumulated Capital
Outlay.
• In the Declared Emergency budget both revenue and appropriations are increased by $5 million
to reflect the projected cost and reimbursement of ongoing earthquake recovery activities.
• An appropriations increase of $1.6 million in the OPEB fund reflects changes in actuarial
assumptions that increased the total retiree health insurance liability. This increase is allocated
to County departments as an increased employee benefit cost. The County has spread the cost
of OPEB over a 20-year period, and the liability should be fully funded by FY 2029-30.
Community Resources/Infrastructure
The recommended Community Resources & Infrastructure All Funds budgets reflect total
appropriations of $148,927,458, an increase of $12,668,814; and total revenue of $107,781,306, a decrease
of $9,073,399. The resulting County Cost of $41.1 million is supported mainly by use of fund balance in
capital improvement and other special revenue funds.
In terms of the General Fund, Net County Cost for Community Resources & Infrastructure functional
areas is budgeted to increase by $1.4 million. The following summarizes the significant changes to the
General Fund budgets:
• A $705,443 increase in Net County Cost in the Public Works budget reflects negotiated wage
and benefit increases as well as increases in General Liability and costs related to the creation of
a groundwater management plan, and decreases in funding allocation that had supported
existing staff.
• An increase of $572,285 in Net County Cost in the Public Works Property Management budget
is due to salary and benefit increases as well as increased utility costs and costs associated with
servicing new space at the South Campus.
• The Public Works Projects division includes 16 projects, all of which are rollover projects fully
funded by the General Fund. The total impact on the General Fund is $1,246,441, a decrease of
$454,393 compared to FY 2014-15.
• An increase of $185,089 in Net County Cost in the Planning, Building and Environmental
Services (PBES) budget reflects negotiated salary and benefit increases as well as funding an
existing position for code enforcementas directed by the Board of Supervisors during the
Budget Study Session on April 21, 2015.
• An increase of $225,047 in Net County Cost in PBES-Environmental Health is due to an increase
in negotiated salaries and benefits that is higher than associated fee revenue. The County is
currently in the process of studying fees to align them more closely with the actual cost of
performing services, so revenue is expected to increase.
In terms of non-General Fund budgets, the following summarizes the significant changes:
• The General Fund Capital Improvements Project within the Capital Improvement Fund projects
a use of fund balance of $15.3 million for projects that carry over from previous years. The
largest of these are projects within the current jail, improvements to the South Campus for
Health and Human Services programs and costs for the new Staff Secure Facility. Only one
new project is budgeted, a security elevator upgrade in the Hall of Justice.
• The total FY 2015-16 Roads Operations and Maintenance budget includes $14.2 million in
appropriations and $6.8 million in revenue, a difference of $7.4 million. This includes a $6.5
million transfer to the Roads Capital Projects fund, and increase of $4.9 million over FY 2014-15.
Projected ending fund balance for FY 2014-15 in this budget is $4.3 million. Therefore, the
Roads budget is likely to end FY 2015-16 with negative fund balance. The Board of Supervisors
authorized a loan in FY 2014-15 from Accumulated Capital Outlay (ACO) of $3.5 million to
support existing projects that cannot reasonably be delayed. A repayment plan is in place to
replace ACO funds by FY 2018-19.
• The Animal Shelter shows an increase of approximately $122,467 in appropriations and an
increased General Fund contribution of $21,276. Increases are mainly a result of negotiated
salary and benefits increases and an increase in County A-87 charges due to a necessary change
in methodology that removed a previously unrecognized General Fund subsidy.
• The Napa County Library operations budget reflects an increase in appropriations of $380,973
mainly due to the transfer of funds for capital projects. There are currently two Library capital
improvement projects included in the FY 2015-16 budget that are continued from FY 2014-15.
Law/Justice
The recommended Law & Justice Departments’ budgets reflect a $1,705,326 increase in appropriations
and a $34,869 increase in revenue for an increase in Net County Cost of $1,670,456 or 7.8%. Both the
Law & Justice and Public Safety Departments continue to implement and strengthen programs to
manage the impacts of the 2011 Public Safety Realignment Act. Significant changes for FY 2015-16
include:
• The District Attorney budget reflects an increase in Net County Cost of $278,338 reflective of an
increase in salaries and benefits due to negotiated increases and the addition of three full time
Investigator positions to eliminate the use of seven extra help investigators. This is part of a
phase-in of use of regular staff instead of extra help due to law changes related to part time
positions.
Both revenue and appropriations are requested to increase by $233,217 in the District Attorney-
Consumer Fraud budget to reflect the addition of new positions approved by the Board in
March 2015. This budget is supported by fines and fees related to consumer protection actions
and there is no cost to the County General Fund.
• Net County Cost in the Probation budget has increased by $876,316 due to negotiated salary
and benefit increases as well as a significant revenue loss. Probation staff estimates that the loss
of federal Title IV-E revenue is $450,000 in the budget year. After a federal review of two
counties’ claiming practices in 2013, there have been significant changes to the definitions of
allowable activities and processes for reimbursement. Many of the activities that were
supported by this funding are mandated and cannot be discontinued.
• The District Attorney, Public Defender and Conflict Public Defender have high profile murder
cases pending. Appropriations do not fully reflect extraordinary costs associated with these
cases. As cases progress, the departments may return to the Board for additional appropriation
authority, if necessary, to address significant one-time costs.
• The Child Support Services budget request remains flat with appropriations and revenue
slightly below FY 2014-15 levels.
Public Safety
The recommended Public Safety Departments’ budgets include a $459,776 increase in appropriations
and a $28,726 decrease in revenues for an increase in Net County Cost of $314,552 and the Fire Fund
using approximately $173,000 of its available fund balance. Significant changes in these budgets
include:
• Intergovernmental Revenues are increased to reflect projected Proposition 172 revenue.
Charges for Services revenue in the Sheriff’s budget reflect a contractual increase for the
provision of law enforcement services to the City of American Canyon and the Town of
Yountville.
The Sheriff budget reflects an increase in appropriations of $926,277, mainly attributed to
negotiated salary and benefit increases. The budgeted appropriations also include the addition
of one Sergeant position to oversee transportation of Napa County Jail inmates. The
Department is also budgeting $185,000 for the replacement of obsolete portable and in-car radio
systems.
• The Corrections budget has an overall reduction in Net County Cost of $824,880 due to the
elimination of $1.25 million in appropriations in FY 2014-15 for the planned relocation of
inmates due to construction process. The appropriation reduction is offset by increases for
negotiated salary and benefits and the addition of two full time Correctional Officers to take
over Court Tunnel Security posts and one Correctional Officer to serve on the “in-county”
medical transport team along with Sheriff Deputies. Salaries and Benefits appropriations also
reflect the cost of a limited term Assistant Director of Corrections approved by the Board of
Supervisors in March 2015. This position was added to assist with operational oversight while the Director of Corrections is involved with the design and construction of a Staff Secure
Facility and securing funding for a new jail.
• The County’s current agreement with Cal-Fire for career fire service is budgeted to grow by a
negotiated annual increase of 5%, or $467,030, and by approximately $200,000 for a three-person
engine company at the Gordon Valley station during the winter months. The total contract for
FY 2015-16 is $9,807,629. The contract is developed assuming a worst case scenario in terms of
overtime and incident-related costs. In the past, actual expenditures are typically $500,000 to $1
million less than budgeted.
Health & Human Services
Overall, the HHSA appropriations total $100,494,168, an increase of $7.4 million from FY 2014-15.
Departmental revenues (excluding the General Fund contribution) are projected at $83,424,042, an
increase of $6.9 million over FY 2014-15. Highlights of the HHSA budgets include:
• The recommended General Fund contribution is $17,070,126 compared to $16,470,911 in FY
2014-15, which is $443,261 or 3% higher, due to an increase in A-87 charges.
• Appropriations in the Health Care Enhancement Program increased by $2.5 million, reflecting
higher salaries and benefits due to negotiated increases as well as $2.2 million in matching
funds that are sent to the state to draw down Intergovernmental Transfer (IGT) funds. The $2.2
million is returned to the County when the IGT revenue is received.
• Appropriations in the Public Health budget are higher by $982,214 due to negotiated salary and
benefit increases, as well as higher Information Technology and Liability Insurance charges.
The budget also includes an increase of $60,000 for services in support of Live Healthy Napa
County.
• Appropriations in Mental Health include an increase of $1,325,131, mainly attributed to
negotiated increases in salaries and benefits, Liability Insurance, and Information Technology
services. Revenue increases total $744,160 as a result of higher Realignment, Medi-Cal
administration, CalWORKS funding for a Mental Health counselor and a Crisis Triage Grant.
• Child Welfare Services appropriations are increased by $649,371 to reflect higher salary and
benefit costs due to negotiated raises, as well as an increase in indirect overhead and support
services costs.
• Appropriations in Self Sufficiency Services are requested to increase by $716,169 due to
negotiated salary and benefit increases as well as the cost of a position added in FY 2014-15.
• An increase in appropriation of $458,798 is requested in the HHSA Operations budget. The
increase is partially due to negotiated salary and benefit increases as well as reassignment of
other positions within the HHSA to this division. Increases are offset by a decrease due to a
one-time expenditure of funds in FY 2014-15 to rehabilitate transitional housing at Napa State Hospital for clients who are homeless and have serious mental illness as they step down from
higher levels of care.
• Beginning in FY 2014-15, HHSA began contributing $500,000 annually to offset the Debt Service
cost related to the 2014 Certificates of Participation that fund the cost of renovations necessary
for HHSA to occupy the new South County Campus.
STATE BUDGET IMPACTS
• On May 14, 2015, the Governor released his revised FY 2015-16 State Budget again reflecting
significant improvements in the State’s financial picture. The budget includes $6.7 billion in
increased revenue over the Governor’s January estimates, largely due to higher capital gains tax
revenue . Proposition 2, passed by the voters in November 2014 requires that “spikes” in
capital gains be used to pay down debts and liabilities and build reserves for future downturns.
The majority of the increased revenues will go to K-12 schools and community colleges under
the Prop 98 guarantee. The Governor’s revised budget includes $633 million to increase the
Rainy Day Fund and an additional $633 million to pay down debts and liabilities. The budget
commits to new spending in only three areas: creating a California Earned Income Tax Credit;
holding tuition at the state’s universities flat for the next two years; and providing health care
and other safety net services to undocumented immigrants who gain Permanent Resident status
under the President’s executive actions.
• For counties, the revised budget provides for the final payment on the Economic Recovery
Bonds, effectively ending the triple flip one year early. It also provides for the final
reimbursement for pre-2004 SB 90 mandated cost claims. This would add approximately $2
million to $3 million to Napa County resources in the form of a one-time payment, likely paid in
October. This amount was not included in the County’s FY 2015-16 Recommended budget and
could be set aside for future jail construction.
• The Proposed State Budget continues an emphasis on funding for Education. Although there is
not a direct connection for Counties, increases in school funding will result in an elimination of
excess ERAF funding returned to the County. For FY 2015-16, only $2 million in excess ERAF is
budgeted and would go entirely to Accumulated Capital Outlay.
• The revised budget also includes $2.2 billion in one-time resources to protect and expand local
water supplies, conserve water, and respond to emergency drought conditions.
• Staff will continue to evaluate the Governor’s revised budget as well as any legislative budget
actions and may provide an update during budget hearings if significant issues arise. We often
do not know what the ultimate impact of the State budget will be on the County until after the
County’s budget is adopted in June.
RECOMMENDED ACTION
Budget Hearings begin on Monday, June 15, 2015. At that time staff will present the Recommended
Budget and your Board will begin accepting general public testimony. Hearings on individual
department budgets will then commence. Once staff presentations and public testimony are
concluded, your Board will be asked to make decisions on appropriations, revenue and financing
levels, approve the capital assets and new positions and adopt any policy and other budget control
language.
It is recommended that your Board hold the scheduled hearings and then on Tuesday, June 23, 2015,
approve the recommended appropriations and revenue levels as presented, approve the recommended
positions, capital assets and policy items, and adopt the County of Napa Budget for FY 2015-16.
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
