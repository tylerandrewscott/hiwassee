To the Honorable Board of Supervisors and Citizens of Mendocino County:
I hereby submit to you the Recommended Budget for Fiscal Year 2014-2015.
The Executive Office is pleased to submit to you a balanced budget for FY 2014-2015. I would like to take this
opportunity to thank all of our County Departments for their assistance in providing information for the
development of this Budget. The Recommended Budget addresses the needs of the citizens of Mendocino County
with a focus on maintaining and improving County services, investing in infrastructure, long-term debt reduction,
employee development, and building and maintaining the General Reserve.
Summary of the Recommended Budget
The FY 2014-2015 Recommended Budget totals $227,550,301, which represents an overall increase of
approximately 1.0% from the prior fiscal year. The Budget includes $167,836,992 in General Fund spending.
The Recommended Budget allocates $1,863,339 to continue funding the Capital Improvement Plan (CIP) as
prioritized by the General Services Agency and the Board of Supervisors. The CIP includes infrastructure projects,
many of which have been deferred for several years. Projects include investing in a new County property tax
system, large scale maintenance projects, and facility enhancements.
In keeping with Board policy, this budget includes placing $234,336 in one-time, unanticipated revenue into the
General Reserve and an appropriation for contingencies of $650,000 for unanticipated expenses.
The County continues to see signs of a slowly improving economy. The projected increase in discretionary revenue
is similar to the growth we experienced last year. We do not anticipate seeing significant revenue increases any
time soon. Because the general cost of doing business will continue to rise, including the cost of health care and
pensions, we must remain cautious and look for innovative methods of doing business that will benefit the
citizens of Mendocino County now in the present, and into the future.
Executive Office staff will return to the Board of Supervisors for Final Budget Hearings September 8 – 10, 2014,
with a refined budget based on the FY 2013-2014 close-out and additional information relevant to the
development of the FY 2014-2015 Mendocino County Operating Budget.
The County’s largest and most important revenue source comes from property taxes. Initial projections show Secured
Property Tax Revenues making a very slow, but steady increase.
Mendocino County’s budgeted Sales and Use Tax revenue for FY 2014-15 is $3,950,000. This estimated figure is only
4.5%, or $176,000 more than Sales and Use Tax received seven years ago in FY 2007-08. We expect this revenue
source to continue to grow at a slow, but steady rate and we will continue to monitor the actuals on a quarterly basis.
Mendocino County’s projected Room Occupancy Tax revenue is anticipated to reach 2007-2008 levels by the end of
FY 2014-15. The County continues to partner with other organizations and agencies to market our tourist destinations
and is contributing approximately $366,000 towards these efforts in FY 2014-2015.
Timber Yield Tax revenue continues to come in at about 50% of the levels seen in 2007-08. We do not anticipate this
revenue source to return to historic levels, but to remain flat for the foreseeable future.
The County’s Budget Unit 1000 is composed of all the above revenue categories in addition to several others such as
Tobacco Settlement Funds and interest income. Together the funds represented in Budget Unit (BU) 1000, compose
the discretionary general fund revenues for the County. In FY 2012-13, we received a larger than budgeted amount of
Tobacco Settlement Funds which is reflected in the graph above along with one-time proceeds from the dissolution of
Redevelopment. We have not returned to revenue levels experienced prior to the Great Recession, however, we are
seeing a slow, but steady increase in discretionary revenues. We expect this to continue and do not anticipate the
growth rate to improve anytime in the near future. The Executive Office will continue to monitor through the
quarterly budget review process.
After the County’s minimal General Reserve was depleted during the Great Recession, the Board of Supervisors
directed placing unanticipated revenue into the General Reserve at the close of each fiscal year beginning in FY 2011-
12. The estimated balance in the General Reserve on June 30, 2014, is $8,790,508, which brings it nearer to the
Board’s recommended balance. The FY 2014-2015 contribution to the General Reserve will be determined in the FY
2014-2015 final budget.
