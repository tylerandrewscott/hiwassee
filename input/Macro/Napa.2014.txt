Submitted for your consideration and adoption is the Fiscal Year 2014-2015 Recommended Budget,
prepared in accordance with your adopted Budget Policies. You are scheduled to begin public
hearings for all General Fund, Special Revenue Fund, Internal Service, and Enterprise departments on
June 16th and to adopt the budget on June 24th.
The Recommended Budget reflects the continued recovery from the Great Recession that impacted the
nation, state and local economies over the past six years. The County is beginning to experience
growth in a number of discretionary revenue sources including property, sales, and transient
occupancy taxes. Staff is projecting limited growth in property taxes, the County’s largest discretionary
revenue source. Property values are expected to continue to increase, although at more moderate rates
compared to pre-recession highs. Because concerns remain about the timing and sustainability of the
improved economic conditions, the Recommended Budget generally maintains General Fund
programs at their current staffing and funding levels.
The Recommended General Fund Budget includes a 4.3% increase in appropriations compared to the
FY 2013-2014 Adopted Budget. This increase mainly results from the recognition of the anticipated
transfer of $9,312,066 in Excess Educational Revenue Augmentation Fund (Excess ERAF) revenue to the
Accumulated Capital Outlay fund that was not included in the FY 2013-2014 Adopted Budget. When
the budgets are compared without the additional transfer, the FY 2014-2015 Recommended General
Fund budget is slightly lower than the previous year. Negotiated salary cost of living increases for
Deputy Sheriff’s Association employees, scheduled step increases, increased employee benefit costs,
and other operating cost increases are offset by decreases in Public Work projects and Central Services.
The Recommended Budget also includes $1.25 million in one-time costs to relocate inmates during a jail
construction project scheduled for FY 2014-2015.
The Recommended Budget reflects the elimination of 2 vacant positions and the addition of 15 full time
positions. Recommended new positions and their funding sources include:
1.0 FTE Human Resources Assistant in Human Resources – Funded by Affordable Care Act
Assigned Fund Balance
2.0 FTE Custodian (Limited Term to June 30, 2016) in Public Works Property Management –
Funded by General Fund
1.0 FTE Supervising Building Maintenance Worker in Public Works Property Management –
Funded by General Fund
2.0 FTE Deputy Sheriff II – Funded by Overtime Savings in the Sheriff’s Budget in the General
Fund
1.0 FTE Animal Services Officer in Animal Services – Funded by General Fund and Animal
Services Contract Revenue
1.0 FTE Probation Officer I/II – Funded by 2011 Realignment
1.0 FTE Assistant Chief Probation Officer in Probation – Funded by General Fund
2.0 FTE Community Aide in HHSA Self Sufficiency – Funded by HHSA Allocations
1.0 FTE Office Assistant II in HHSA Operations – Funded by HHSA Allocations
1.0 FTE Office Assistant II in Building Inspection – Funded by Building Inspection Fees
2.0 FTE Building Inspector I/II in Building Inspection - Funded by Building Inspection Fees
BUDGET PROCESS
The FY 2014-2015 budget process began January 7, 2014, when your Board approved the FY 2014-2015
Budget Policies and Calendar. Other steps in the process included:
? January 9th: Budget Orientation/Training for all departments.
? February 26th: Departments submitted their budget requests to the County Executive Office.
? March 18th: A Mid-Year Review of the FY 2013-2014 budget status was presented to the Board.
? April 2rd: CEO Analysts completed their initial review of departmental budget requests.
? April 22th: The Assistant CEO presented preliminary FY 2014-2015 General Fund budget
projections and your Board held a Budget Study Session to provide input into the
Recommended Budget.
BUDGET POLICIES
As mentioned above, in January of this year, your Board adopted a set of Budget Policies to guide staff
in preparing the FY 2014-2015 Recommended Budget. Utilizing these policies as well as principles
outlined in the County’s Strategic Financial Plan, the General Fund budget is balanced and should
remain structurally balanced in coming years, albeit finely so. Significant uncertainties remain
regarding the strength of the real estate market and its impact on property taxes, growth in transient
occupancy and sales taxes, and the sustainability of Excess ERAF as a significant revenue source. In
alignment with the policies, the General Reserve and the Designation for Fiscal Uncertainty are fully funded. To meet the General Reserve requirement for FY 2014-2015, an additional $315,443 is included
as an increase to Obligated Fund Balance. An increase to the Designation for Fiscal Uncertainties will
occur after the close of the current fiscal year.
Current policy guides that an Appropriation for Contingency be included in the budget at a minimum
of three percent of General Fund appropriations. On April 22, 2014, your Board approved a deviation
of the Budget Policy for the Appropriation for Contingency to reflect the one-time extraordinary cost of
relocation of inmates during a significant jail construction project. The Appropriation for Contingency
of $4,250,000 is included in the Recommended FY 2014-2015 budget. Once the current year is
completed, the Appropriation for Contingency will be restored to the level stated in the policy.
THE ALL FUNDS BUDGET
The County’s Recommended All Funds Budget for FY 2014-2015 totals $458,212,643 in appropriations.
This is a $4.1 million, or 1%, increase in appropriations compared to the FY 2013-2014 Adopted Budget
appropriation level. A detailed comparison of the FY 2014-2015 Recommended Budget’s appropriation
levels to the FY 2013-2014 Adopted Budget follows:
The primary reasons for the increase in the Recommended Budget compared to the FY 2013-2014
Adopted All Funds Budget include:
? An overall increase of approximately $7.6 million in General Fund appropriations reflects the
transfer of Excess ERAF dollars to the Accumulated Capital Outlay Fund for major capital
projects, offset by a reduction in Public Works Projects in the General Fund. Other significant
changes include appropriation increases in Public Works Property Management, Corrections,
and Sheriff budgets, and a decrease in Central Services.
? A $4.0 million increase in expenditures in the Tobacco Settlement program and an
approximately $900,000 increase in the Special Projects program fund a portion of the
renovation of the newly acquired Health and Human Services Agency (HHSA) South County
campus.
? A $3.8 million increase in Operating Special Revenue Funds appropriations based on the
following:
o Approximately $2.4 million in increased appropriations in HHSA primarily in two
areas: in Mental Health and Child Welfare Services for the implementation of the Katie
A. settlement to provide enhanced mental health services for children in or at risk of
foster care placement; and in Self Sufficiency for increased services related to
implementation of the Affordable Care Act. Increases in HHSA overall appropriations
are offset by a $3 million decrease in Public Health with the elimination of the County
Medical Services Program contribution, with 1991 Realignment funds being transferred
directly to the State.
o The Fire Fund appropriations are projected to increase by approximately $4.0 million.
This increase is due to a transfer of funds to capital projects to begin the process of
constructing satellite volunteer fire stations at Berryessa Highlands and Berryessa
Estates, and to capital assets to purchase two new water tenders, an engine, a utility
vehicle, and emergency generators for each volunteer fire company station.
o Offsetting decreases occur primarily within the Roads Fund (-$1.8 million) and the
Affordable Housing Fund (-$1.2 million). The Roads Fund Capital Improvement
Projects appropriations have decreased as major projects scheduled in previous years
have been completed. A decrease in appropriations in the Affordable Housing Fund is
attributed to two projects that were financed during FY 2013-2014 (Oak Creek Terrace
and Napa State Hospital) and a decrease in financing in Proximity Housing from the FY
2013-14 level based on anticipated usage.
? A $17.0 million decrease in appropriations in the Capital Project Fund (CIP) reflects the
reduction of $26 million included in the FY 2013-2014 Adopted Budget to purchase the former
Dey Labs campus to house the majority of HHSA functions combined with increases for
planned and ongoing projects. For FY 2014-2015, major projects total approximately $43 million
and include renovation of the HHSA campus, a number of jail-related projects, initial design
work on the Staff Secure Facility, improvements at the Sheriff’s Facility to house the County’s
Emergency Operations Center, and other various improvements to County facilities.
Enterprise Funds include the Napa County Airport, Fifth Street Parking Garage, and Napa
County Animal Shelter. For FY 2014-2015, appropriations are budgeted to increase by $1.4
million from the FY 2013-2014 level. The majority of the increase occurs in the Napa County
Airport and the Fifth Street Parking Garage funds due to recognition of depreciation expense in
accordance with accounting standards for enterprise funds. In prior years, depreciation was
recognized as a year-end closing adjustment rather than being included in the budget process.
? Internal Service Funds include Information Technology Services, Fleet Management,
Employee/Retiree Benefits, and Liability Insurance. Internal Service Fund overall
appropriations are projected to increase by $2.9 million. Of this, $1.0 million is related to Fleet
Management for purchase of replacement vehicles and equipment. Purchase of new vehicles
was suspended during FY 2013-2014 to evaluate fleet needs. As a result of the evaluation, 10
vehicles in the fleet have been eliminated, and low use vehicles were relocated from
departments into the fleet pool for multiple department use. Appropriations in the
Employee/Retiree Benefits Fund are anticipated to increase by $765,000 due to higher premiums
and claims cost, as well as an increase of $210,000 toward the Other Post Employment Benefits
trust. An increase in Information Technology Services reflects higher salary and benefit cost as
well as purchase of various software and other services necessary for County operations.
The County’s Recommended General Fund Budget appropriation level for FY 2014-2015 totals
$183,714,929. This is an increase of $7.6 million or 4.3%, compared to the FY 2013-2014 Adopted Budget
appropriation level. A more detailed comparison of the FY 2014-2015 Recommended General Fund
Budget to the FY 2013-2014 Adopted General Fund Budget follows:
The primary reasons for the increase in both revenues and expenditures in the Recommended Budget
compared to the FY 2013-2014 Adopted General Fund Budget include:
? Recognition of $4.5 million in Excess ERAF revenue above the FY 2013-2014 Adopted Budget as
well as growth in sales, transient occupancy, and property tax revenue for a total year-over-year
increase of $8.3 million in Discretionary Revenue.
A $3.8 million reduction in appropriations in Public Works Projects is offset by a commensurate
reduction in Departmental Revenue in that budget unit.
? Transfer of approximately $9.3 million of Excess ERAF revenue to the Accumulated Capital
Outlay Fund, which includes $2.5 million previously used for ongoing operations.
? A $1.25 million increase in the Corrections budget for relocation of inmates during a large
construction project in the jail. The total cost is reduced somewhat by savings in other areas of
the budget. The increase in the Corrections budget is offset by a corresponding decrease in the
Appropriation for Contingency.
? An increase of $1.3 million in appropriations in the Sheriff’s budget reflecting negotiated wage
increases and increased overtime budgeted. This increase is net of projected salary savings
based on historical levels.
? Proposition 172 sales tax revenue for Public Safety is considered semi-discretionary as it may be
shifted between public safety functions. In the current fiscal year Proposition 172 revenue of
$13.4 million is expected, slightly above budget. For FY 2014-2015, a growth factor of 3% is
assumed, consistent with other estimated sales tax growth.
The FY 2014-2015 Recommended Budget reflects an $8.3 million (7.9%) increase in Discretionary
Revenue compared to the FY 2013-2014 Adopted Budget level. This is the net result of increases and
decreases from the Adopted Budget in a variety of revenue sources. The major increases include:
? $2.2 million (4.6%) increase in Secured Property Tax revenue;
? $660,000 (4.3%) increase in VLF Swap Property Tax revenue;
? $96,000 (4.8%) increase in Triple Flip Property Tax revenue;
? $50,000 (6.4%) increase in Current Year Supplemental Property Tax revenue;
? $249,000 (4.0%) increase in Sales and Use Tax revenue;
? $1.5 million (11.6%) increase in Transient Occupancy Tax (TOT) revenue; and
? $4.5 million (39%) increase in Excess ERAF.
In forecasting discretionary revenues FY 2014-2015, current year estimated revenue, rather than
Adopted Budget, is used as the basis for projection. Property Taxes were assumed to increase by 3%
from the current year estimated revenue; in FY 2015-2016 by 4%; and in FY 2016-17 to 2018-2019 by 5%
annually. Sales Tax was assumed to increase by 3% annually from current year estimates for each of
the five forecasted years, and Transient Occupancy Tax was assumed to increase by 4% annually
during the same five-year period. Future revenue assumptions are based on continued economic
growth and moderately escalating property values. In alignment with direction from your Board, the
FY 2014-2015 Requested Budget assumes Excess ERAF used for operations being reduced from the
current $5 million to $2.5 million. A further reduction of $2.5 million, planned for FY 2015-2016, will
altogether eliminate the use of Excess ERAF for ongoing operations due to its volatile nature. All
Excess ERAF not used for operations is transferred to the Accumulated Capital Outlay Fund to address
significant ongoing and future capital project needs. In light of the Governor’s proposal to increase
funding to school districts, continued Excess ERAF revenue will depend on what happens to property
values over the next several years.

FUND BALANCE, RESERVES AND DESIGNATIONS4
The Recommended General Fund Budget assumes a FY 2014-2015 beginning fund balance of
approximately $64.1 million, an increase of approximately $5.7 million, or 9.8%, from the FY 2013-2014
actual beginning balance level5. The $64.1 million beginning balance is comprised of:
? $24.3 million in General Reserves. This represents approximately 9.9% of General Fund and
Health & Human Services Fund appropriations, not including the operating contingency, the
General Fund transfer to the Health & Human Services Fund and any transfer to the ACO
Fund. Board Policy calls for maintaining General Reserves at 10% of appropriations, net of the
exclusions mentioned above. The Recommended Budget adds $315,443 to General Reserves,
meeting the Board’s policy goal of 10%.
? $4.3 million in a Reserve for Loans and Advances Receivable. This represents funds owed to
the County by the Lake Berryessa and Napa Berryessa Resort Improvement Districts (RID).
During FY 2013-2014, the Board voted to forgive $1,172,000 in in loans to Lake Berryessa RID,
bringing the actual amount owed to $3,097,000.
? $28.1 million “assigned” (or designated) for various purposes. This includes $24.3 million
assigned for Fiscal Uncertainties, which represents approximately 9.9% of General Fund and
Health & Human Services Fund appropriations as described above. At the Recommended
level, the budgeted Designation for Fiscal Uncertainties will be approximately $315,443 less
than the amount necessary to meet the Board’s goal (10% of appropriations as described above)
for this designation. The assignments also include $1.5 million for future Affordable Care Act
(ACA) costs. Beginning in FY 2014-2015 new fees and taxes will be imposed on employers to
fund various components of the ACA. These additional fees will increase health premiums by
as much as 3% to 4.5%. In this Recommended Budget, a portion of the $1.5 million originally
set aside by the Board is being used to fund a full time Human Resources Assistant dedicated to
tracking and analyzing data associated with ACA to ensure County compliance.
Approximately $2.2 million is assigned for other designated purposes or encumbered in various
departments.
? The “available” balance of $7.4 million, which can be used to fund County programs. It is
important to keep in mind, however, that the above fund balance number is only an estimate.
The Auditor-Controller will determine the final fund balance number in the first quarter of FY
2014-2015. Any revision to the Adopted Budget will be scheduled for your Board’s
consideration once the actual fund balance numbers have been established. If additional fund
balance is identified at that time, staff will be recommending that it first be utilized to increase
the Appropriation for Contingencies and the Designation for Fiscal Uncertainties to the level set
as a goal by the Board.
SIGNIFICANT ISSUES
As the economy has improved over the past few years, the County has continued its prudent
budgeting practices in order to maintain structural balance. With the Board’s leadership, the County
adopted and has followed Budget Policies that have preserved a solid fiscal foundation. As the
economy continues to grow it is important for the County to address a number of significant unmet
needs and plan for expected increases in future pension and health care costs. The following issues will
need to be addressed in future fiscal years:
1. Roads: Public Works staff has identified the need for approximately $9.1 million dollars per
year in order to maintain a 70% Pavement Condition Indicator (PCI) on 416.8 miles of roadway.
The FY 2014-2015 Recommended Budget includes $2,052,000 in General Fund appropriations
for this purpose. In line with your direction, this amount will increase to $2.6 million in FY
2015-2016 and by $560,000 each year until the final General Fund appropriation reaches $3.7
million in FY 2017-2018, the year before Measure T funds will become available. Between
Measure T funds, funding from outside sources, and the General Fund contribution, revenues
are estimated to equal the $9.1 million projected cost. Further study will be needed to
determine the ongoing cost to maintain the 70% PCI standard.
2. Capital Infrastructure Needs: The County continues to face many challenges as a result of aging
facilities. The acquisition of the new HHSA campus in December 2013 and the renovation that
will take place during FY 2014-2015 will add new, more modern space to address future service
levels. Construction of a new jail remains a high priority. Originally estimated to cost
approximately $70 million, that figure will likely be closer to $100 million by the time that
sufficient resources are available to fund the project. It is important to note this does not
include increases in ongoing operational costs associated with the new jail. In the meantime,
the County continues to place a high priority on setting aside funding for a new jail. In
addition, there are a number of costly renovations that need to be made on the County’s
remaining buildings which include: the Administration Building, Hall of Justice, Carithers,
Juvenile Justice Center, and Sheriff facility. In the County’s Five Year Capital Improvement
Program covering Fiscal Years 2013-2014 through 2016-2017, the Public Works Department
identified $132 million in capital projects. In coming years, staff will need to develop a financial
strategy to address these growing infrastructures needs.
3. Labor Negotiations: In October 2013, the County entered into a new three-year agreement with
the Deputy Sheriff’s Association. Currently, the County is in negotiations with Napa Public
Services Employees Union/SEIU Local 1021 for a successor agreement to the one that will expire
on June 30, 2014 for non-safety employees. The Recommended Budget does not include
funding for any potential negotiated adjustments. The outcome of these negotiations could
impact labor costs and are not included in the departments’ Recommended Budgets. As a point
of reference, every 1% increase in employee salaries costs the County approximately $1.1
million.
4. Employee Pension Costs: The County has made concerted efforts to proactively pay for
employee pension costs in a responsible manner. In addition, CalPERS has made significant
changes in amortization and smoothing policies and actuarial assumptions that will help
agencies address unfunded liabilities in a proactive manner. These changes will also have
significant financial impact on employer contribution rates in the coming years. In February,
the CalPERS Board of Administration voted to revise actuarial assumptions for expected
changes in retiree mortality, reflecting longer life expectancy. In addition in April 2013, the
Board voted to revise average investment earnings assumptions, amortization and smoothing
policies in an effort to reduce market volatility. These assumption changes, which go into effect
beginning in FY 2015-2016, will result in near and long term cost increases for retirement
benefits. Due to the assumption changes, combined employer/employee CalPERS rates for
miscellaneous employees are expected to rise from 25.0% in FY 2014-2015 to 32.2% in FY 2020-
21. Combined employer/employee CalPERS rates for safety employees are expected to rise
from 36.6% to 48.7% during the same period. The impact on the County budget will be less
than the impact on many of our neighboring cities and counties since the County shares rate
increases and decreases on a 50/50 basis with employees.
5. Affordable Care Act Implementation: Under new rules included as part of the Affordable Care
Act (ACA), employers are required to provide affordable health insurance for employees
working an average of 30 hours or more per week or 130 hours or more per month. Originally,
this employer mandate was scheduled to go into effect in 2014, but implementation of this
aspect of the ACA has been delayed until January 1, 2015. Staff continues to include an
assignment of approximately $1.4 million in the General Fund to mitigate the anticipated
additional costs. Because the financial risk to the County is not yet clearly known, this remains
an area to closely monitor and is in addition to projected premium increases.
6. Other Post-Employment Benefits (OPEB): The County’s unfunded OPEB liability as of the June
30, 2011 valuation was $34.4 million. Staff is working to update the valuation based on earning
through June 30, 2013 and will provide the projected unfunded liability once it has been
completed. In the last five years, since the Board adopted a policy to fund the OPEB liability,
the County has reduced its obligation by almost 50%. The County will be contributing 6.6% of
pay in the Recommended Budget or approximately $6.7 million toward paying down this
liability over the next 15 years. The current market value of plan assets represents a 56%
funded ratio.
Given these issues and other fiscal risks the County may be facing, staff believes it would be prudent to
continue to be cautious, to control costs and to avoid major new investments in operating (non onetime)
programs. At the same time, given the nature of the General Fund’s fund balance and the
consideration and planning reflected in the County’s adopted Strategic Financial Plan, the County is
well positioned to respond in a careful and thoughtful way to the impact of an unexpected and
significant downturn in the economy.
OVERVIEW OF THE RECOMMENDED BUDGET
The following are some of the key issues associated with the FY 2014-2015 Recommended Budget:
County-wide Issues
? As noted above, employee salary and related benefit cost increases due to cost of living
adjustments and step increases.
? The Recommended Budget reflects the impact of a $1.4 million, or 8%, increase in the cost of the
County’s share of employee health insurance. This amount does not reflect the future impact of
the Affordable Care Act as previously discussed.
? Consistent with the Board’s adopted Budget Policies, the Recommended Budget reflects
payments necessary to fully fund the County’s Other Post-Employment Benefit (OPEB)
unfunded liability on a 20-year amortization schedule. The Recommended Budget includes
contributions of 6.6% of pay or approximately $6.7 million toward paying down this liability
over approximately the next 15 years.
General Administration/Finance
The recommended General Administration and Finance All Funds budgets reflect total appropriations
of $105,616,636, an increase of $13,657,969; and total revenue of $151,724,413, an increase of $9,615,070.
In terms of the General Fund, Net County Cost for General Administration and Finance functional
areas is budgeted to increase by $4.0 million. The following summarize the significant changes to the
General Fund budgets:
? The Human Resources Division of the County Executive Office has an increased Net County
Cost of approximately $87,000 primarily due to the addition of one 1.0 FTE Human Resources
Assistant to handle ongoing data collection and analysis to remain in compliance with the
Affordable Care Act (ACA). This position is funded through a reduction in the fund balance
assignment for ACA.
? The Treasurer/Tax Collector has continued to budget for consulting services to assist with the
completion of a comprehensive analysis of the County’s banking services needs. These funds
were not spent in FY 2013-2014 as anticipated due to needing a broader scope of work and bids
for consulting services exceeding original estimates. The department is reassessing whether
some of the work can be done in house and should release a new request for proposals for a
consultant during FY 2014-2015.
? Appropriations in the Elections Division of the Assessor-Recorder-County Clerk have increased
by approximately $66,000. However, the increase is offset by anticipated revenue of
approximately $126,000 more than the level included in the FY 2013-2014 Adopted Budget due
to revenue from other entities who consolidate their elections with the November 4, 2014
General Election.
Non-Departmental budget units are as follows:
? Use of approximately $4.0 million in Tobacco Settlement and $900,000 in Special Projects funds
will support a portion of the construction necessary for HHSA to begin providing services at the
new South County Campus.
? Contingencies have been reduced by 22.7% from $5,500,000 to $4,250,000 to provide one-time
funding to relocate inmates during a jail construction project, as approved by your Board on
April 22, 2014.
? In the past, the General Fund provided financial support to two dependent districts – Lake
Berryessa Resort Improvement District and Napa Berryessa Resort Improvement District.
However, appropriations have decreased in the General Expenditures budget unit because new
loans are not required for operations at this time. Repayment of existing loans totaling
approximately $3.1 million is not anticipated for FY 2014-2015.
? The General Fund will contribute $2,052,000 to the Roads Fund and approximately $9.3 million
in Excess ERAF revenue to Accumulated Capital Outlay.
? There is an overall reduction in the Affordable Housing Fund with the partial financing of a
portion of Oak Creek Terrace affordable housing development in FY 2013-2014. For FY 2014-
2015 approximately $3.3 million is budgeted in affordable housing projects including $2.9
million for the Napa Creekside Project and $400,000 for Proximity Housing.
Community Resources/Infrastructure
The recommended Community Resources & Infrastructure All Funds budgets reflect total
appropriations of $126,419,644, a decrease of $19,044,357; and total revenue of $107,140,705, an increase
of $8,987,934.
In terms of the General Fund, Net County Cost for Community Resources & Infrastructure functional
areas is budgeted to increase by $1.4 million. The following summarize the significant changes to the
General Fund budgets:
? A $123,853 decrease in Net County Cost in PBES-Environmental Health is related to additional
revenue generated due to a continued strong demand for services.
? An increase of $937,313 in Net County Cost in the Public Works Property Management budget
is attributed to additional staff and contract costs related to the new South County Campus.
The increase includes the addition of two full time Custodian positions for half of the year as
well as a Building Maintenance Supervisor position to help oversee a staff of 12 providing
maintenance services for 48 buildings in 20 different County locations.
? The Public Works Projects division includes 19 projects, 7 of which are rollover or new projects
fully funded by the General Fund. The total impact on the General Fund is $1,700,834, an
increase of $167,892 compared to FY 2013-2014.
In terms of non-General Fund budgets, the following summarizes the significant changes:
? Appropriations and revenue for the Roads Operating and Capital Improvement budget
divisions are projected to decrease as a result of completed projects. Total appropriations for
projects have decreased by $3.8 million due to the completion or partial completion of work in
FY 2013-2014. The FY 2014-2015 appropriations include nearly $8.5 million in ongoing (mostly
bridge) projects as well as $162,000 for a Napa-Yountville Traffic Safety Trail project. Pursuant
to the County’s revised Strategic Financial Plan, FY 2014-2015 is the second year in a five year
phase-in of additional General Fund support for road maintenance. The General Fund
contribution increased $560,000 in FY 2014-2015 to $2,052,000 and will increase by $560,000 each
year through FY 2017-2018 when it reaches $3.7 million.
? The Animal Shelter shows an increase of approximately $10,407 in General Fund contributions.
With the City of St. Helena no longer a contributor to the Animal Shelter operations, the
remaining cities (Napa, American Canyon and Yountville) and County have increased their
share of the cost by 6.63% or $49,823 as a result. The Cities and County also contribute 3% of
their annual cost directly to the Animal Shelter Capital Improvement Project division for future
capital needs.
? Revenue from Excess ERAF for the Accumulated Capital Outlay is budgeted at $9.3 million, an
increase of $7.2 million from the FY 2013-2014 Adopted Budget to reflect an updated revenue
estimate and $2.5 million in revenue redirected from General Fund Operations. Appropriations
in the amount of $4.5 million reflect a decrease of $22.5 million from the FY 2013-2014 level,
reflecting the completion of the purchase of the South County Campus. Most projects budgeted
address capital needs in the current jail.
? The Building Inspection budget includes increased appropriations of approximately $273,000
for two 1.0 FTE Building Inspector I/II position, one for regular building inspection duties and
one for the County’s Code Enforcement Program, and 1.0 FTE Office Assistant II to provide
support for increased volume of building inspection and code enforcement activities.
? The Napa County Library operations budget reflects a $652,324 decrease in use of fund balance.
A slight increase in operating appropriations is offset by $923,536 in increased revenue, mostly
attributed to additional Excess ERAF, allocation of state funds to the Literacy Program, and an
increase in contract revenue from the Town of Yountville to pay for additional Library hours.
The County General Fund contribution to the Library increased by $148,587 to $482,777. The
increase reflects funding of the Webmaster, as well as the supporting the cost of the Library
Director and Public Information Officer positions.
Law/Justice
The recommended Law & Justice Departments’ budgets reflect a $909,363 increase in appropriations
and a $428,402 increase in revenue for an increase in Net County Cost of $480,961 or 2.3%. Both the
Law & Justice and Public Safety Departments continue to implement and strengthen programs to
manage the impacts of the 2011 Public Safety Realignment Act. Significant changes for FY 2014-2015
include:
? The budget reflects adding an additional 1.0 FTE Probation Officer I/II for the Deferred Entry of
Judgment Program. Previously this position was funded at 0.25 FTE through 2011
Realignment. Response to this program has been overwhelming, and dedicating a full time
Probation Officer will allow for better use of this strategy to divert individuals from
incarceration.
? The budget also includes a request to add a 1.0 FTE Assistant Chief Probation Officer position to
assist the Chief Probation Officer to plan, develop and implement department programs,
policies and procedures and oversee the operation of all department programs. The position is
assumed to be filled beginning in January 2015.
? Both the District Attorney and Public Defender have high profile murder cases pending.
Appropriations do not currently reflect extraordinary costs associated with these cases. As
cases progress, the departments may return to the Board for additional appropriation authority,
if necessary, to address significant one-time costs.
? Child Support Services budget request remains flat with appropriations and revenue identical
to FY 2013-2014 levels.
Public Safety
The recommended Public Safety Departments’ budgets include a $6,480,598 increase in appropriations
and a $1,513,873 increase in revenues for an increase in Net County Cost of $2.2 million and the Fire
Fund using $2.7 million of its available fund balance. Significant changes in these budgets include:
? Increased salary and benefit costs of $1.3 million in the Sheriff’s budget reflect negotiated cost of
living and step increases as well as the increased costs for retirement benefits, and an increase in
the appropriation for overtime to align the budget more closely with historical spending levels.
The overtime increase is net of the cost of 2.0 FTE Deputy Sheriff II positions requested.
? One 1.0 FTE Animal Services Officer is requested in the Animal Services budget due to
increased demand for services, the cost of which is partially offset by a decrease in extended
hours and an increase in revenue from contract cities.
? Intergovernmental Revenues are increased to reflect projected Proposition 172 revenue.
Charges for Services revenue in the Sheriff’s budget reflect an increase based on reimbursement
for actual salary and benefits for staff assigned to provide law enforcement services to the City
of American Canyon and the Town of Yountville.
The Corrections budget includes approximately $1.25 million for one-time costs to relocate
inmates out of the jail during the basement corridor and other capital facility projects. A
proportionate reduction in the Appropriation for Contingencies was approved by the Board on
April 22, 2014 to accommodate this extraordinary expense.
? The Fire Protection budget reflects an increase to provide full funding for the construction of
two satellite volunteer fire stations at Berryessa Highlands and Berryessa Estates.
? The County’s current agreement with Cal-Fire for career fire service is budgeted to increase by
3% or $259,894 for a total of $8,923,013. The contract is developed assuming a worst case
scenario in terms of overtime and incident-related costs. In the past, actual expenditures are
typically $500,000 to $1 million less than budgeted. However, given the drought and high fire
risk conditions it is likely to be closer to the budgeted amount this year.
Health & Human Services
In the FY 2013-2014 budget, the Board of Supervisors approved the conversion of HHSA to a separate
fund status. The FY 2014-2015 Recommended Budget continues to base the budget on principles
developed during the multi-year planning process by HHSA and the County Executive Office in
preparation for the conversion. Overall, the HHSA appropriations total $93,090,001, an increase of $2.4
million from FY 2013-2014. Departmental revenues (excluding the General Fund contribution) are
projected at $76,463,136, an increase of $3.4 million over FY 2013-2014. Highlights of the HHSA
budgets include:
? The recommended General Fund contribution is $16.62 million compared to $16.47 million in
FY 2013-2014, which is $155,952 or 0.9% higher, due to an increase in A-87 charges.
? Appropriations in the Public Health budget are reduced by $3 million to reflect the redirection
of 1991 Realignment revenue from the County Medical Services Program to the state as
provided by Assembly Bill 85. This redirection results from savings that counties would see
from providing health care to indigent adults who now will largely be covered by Medi-Cal
expansion programs.
? Appropriations in Mental Health include an increase in salary and benefits of approximately
$925,000 due to additional positions previously approved by the Board for expansion of Medi-
Cal coverage to clients as part of the Affordable Care Act, as well as implementation of the
terms of the class action lawsuit known as “Katie A” that provides for home-based and
community based mental health services to children who are in the foster care system or are at
risk of removal from their families.
? Child Welfare Services appropriations and revenues are increased by approximately $800,000 to
reflect additional federal, state, and grant-funded positions in Adoptions, Family Preservation,
and Emergency Response Units.
? Appropriations in Self Sufficiency Services are requested to increase by approximately $1.9
million due to program expansion. Two additional 1.0 FTE Community Aide positions are requested to help ensure timely Medi-Cal and CalFresh application processing and customer
service to the community. The appropriation for services and supplies are increased due to
Workforce Investment Act contracts. Increases are fully offset by additional state and federal
revenue in this budget.
? An increase in appropriation of approximately $465,000 is requested in the HHSA Operations
budget. The increase is partially due to additional positions approved during FY 2013-14.
Further, a 1.0 FTE Office Assistant II is requested for administrative support that was
previously performed by extra help staff. An increase in services and supplies is primarily
attributed to contracted services for preparing for the Health Information Exchange, homeless
tracking software, records management and privacy and security consulting services.
? Beginning in FY 2014-15, HHSA will contribute $500,000 annually to offset the Debt Service cost
related to the 2014 Certificates of Participation that fund the cost of renovations necessary for
HHSA to occupy the new South County Campus.
STATE BUDGET IMPACTS
? On May 13, 2014, the Governor released his revised FY 2014-2015 State Budget reflecting
significant improvements in the State’s financial picture. The budget includes $2.4 billion in
projected revenue increases above the January proposed budget level, largely due to increased
taxes from capital gains. The main focus of the budget is to establish a “Rainy Day Fund,” and
make progress to pay down the “wall of debt.” The Governor and legislative leaders are
working toward a constitutional amendment on the November 2014 ballot (to become effective
for FY 2015-2016) that would direct excess funding be used in a 50/50 split to pay down
liabilities and contribute to reserves. The amendment would, depending on economic
conditions and capital gains tax revenues, require deposits into the Rainy Day Fund until the
fund reached a maximum of 10% of General Fund revenues. This reserve could only be used
under certain economic conditions to smooth the effects of a financial downturn.
? The second half of “Rainy Day” funds would go toward debt repayment. The state’s long term
liabilities, which are estimated to total $337.5 billion, present an ongoing fiscal problem.
Among the long term liabilities is $6.7 billion in mandated cost claims owed to counties, cities,
community colleges, and schools. The proposed budget includes $100 million in mandated cost
payments. Napa County is currently owed nearly $10 million in unpaid SB 90 mandated cost
claims. Given that the budget includes payment of only 1.49% of outstanding claims, any
additional revenue to the County would likely be minimal.
? The Proposed State Budget continues an emphasis on funding for Education. Although there is
not a direct connection for Counties, potential changes in Education can have an underlying
impact on local government. Changes in education finance in FY 2013-2014 included the Local
Control Funding Formula (LCFF), providing additional revenue to schools. The LCFF,
however, did not have an appreciable impact on property tax revenue returned to the County in
the form of Excess ERAF. As funding increases to schools, County staff will closely monitor any
effects on County finances, particularly Excess ERAF. 
Staff will continue to evaluate the Governor’s revised budget as well as any legislative budget
actions and may provide an update during budget hearings if significant issues arise. We often
do not know what the ultimate impact of the State budget will be on the County until after the
County’s budget is adopted in June.
RECOMMENDED ACTION
Budget Hearings begin on Monday, June 16, 2014. At that time staff will present the Recommended
Budget and your Board will begin accepting general public testimony. Hearings on individual
department budgets will then commence. Once staff presentations and public testimony are
concluded, your Board will be asked to make decisions on appropriations, revenue and financing
levels, approve the capital assets and new positions and adopt any policy and other budget control
language.
It is recommended that your Board hold the scheduled hearings, approve the recommended
appropriations and revenue levels as presented, approve the recommended positions, capital assets
and policy items and adopt the County of Napa Budget for FY 2014-2015 on Tuesday, June 25, 2014.
