This letter transmits the County Administrative Officer's Fiscal Year 2013-14 Proposed Budget
for your consideration during Budget Hearings which are scheduled for June 17 through June
27, 2013. The Proposed 2013-14 Budget totals $628 million, reflecting increases in various
Special District Funds. The total General Fund budget is essentially unchanged at $396 million.
2013-14 COUNTY BUDGET
The Proposed County Budget for 2013-14 reflects another difficult year resulting from the slow
economic recovery. While housing prices show modest gains, they are still well below the peak
levels of six years ago. Since much of the County's economic base is tied to the housing
market, the associated impacts are evident in this proposed budget.
The General Fund is particularly constrained and includes the use of $6.5 million in carryover
fund balance, which represents a reduction of the County's structural deficit by almost 50% from
the FY 2012-13 Final Budget. Unknown at this time is the full impact of health care reform,
sequestration, and the 2013-14 State Budget.
The recommended Proposed Budget meets the requirements of the County General Fund
Budgeting Principles adopted by your Board and prioritizes the public safety, health and welfare
of the residents of the County. Overall growth in primary general purpose revenues totals
approximately 3% which finances the cost of doing business throughout the budget.
The recommendations in the Proposed Budget are largely accomplished through the following
actions:
• Continued reduction in payroll costs of approximately $5.9 million through negotiated
furloughs or equivalent in 2013-14. The continuation of the furlough minimizes position
and program reductions and helps address the County's overall deficit, Budget reductions of approximately 10% to Net County Cost in many County
departments and programs, with the additional requirement that departments absorb any
cost increases,
• Changes in fees and charges to reflect the actual cost of doing business,
• Modest increases in General Purpose revenues, and
• Reliance on fund balance to alleviate the need for additional reductions.
A total of 2,342 positions are recommended which represents a net increase of 30 over 2012-13
budgeted positions. The increase results from mid-year additions to implement the Affordable
Care Act (ACA) and related health care programs.
2013-14 STATE BUDGET
On February 12, 2013, we provided your Board with an overview of the Governor's Proposed
2013-14 Budget. The Revised State Budget is scheduled to be released in mid-May and we will
include an updated report with the Supplemental Budget.
2014 FEDERAL BUDGET
The impacts of the $85 billion across the board federal sequestration spending cuts imposed
March 1, 2013, are still not finalized at the federal level. These reductions are targeted to
impact County discretionary programs such as Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment
Block Grants, HIV Screening funding and reduction in Workforce Investment Act grants. As
details are made available, supplemental budget reports will be provided.
2013-14 PROPOSED BUDGET & ALLOCATION OF GENERAL FUND NET COUNTY COST
The 2013-14 allocation of $97,411 ,241 Net County Cost of operations included in the Proposed
Budget is as shown in the following chart:

Public Safety Realignment (AB 109 implemented in October 2011 ), realigns qualifying low-level
offenders convicted of non-serious, non-violent, non-sex offenders in the adult parole program
to counties for supervision, imprisonment and rehabilitation. As of April 2013, 269 individuals
have participated in the AB 109 Program, 147 are in the Post Release Community Supervision
and 122 were locally sentenced under Penal Code 1170h. AB 109 has provided the opportunity
to strengthen partnerships with community justice partner groups. Sixteen service providers
throughout the County provide a comprehensive array of services including substance abuse
treatment, housing, reentry planning, cognitive behavior treatment and educational
programming.
Redevelopment Successor Agency
In 2012-13, the Redevelopment Successor Agency continued the wind-down of activities,
including the positive resolution of the July true-up issue and the approval of both Due Diligence
Reviews and the issuance of the Finding of Completion by the State Department of Finance.
The Asset Transfer Audit by the State Controller's Office required by AB 1484 is scheduled for
completion May 2013. The Long Range Property Management Plan for the remaining three
sites owned by the Successor Agency will be completed in 2013-14.
Health Services Agency (HSA)
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA)
• It is estimated that under federal health care reform, which goes into effect in January
2014, approximately 10,000 County residents will be eligible for Medi-Cal and
approximately 12,000 County residents will purchase health insurance with a federal
subsidy significantly impacting direct and indirect services at County clinics and through
contracted partnership services.
• HSA will transition 8,000 youth from the Healthy Families program into the Medi-Cal
program by August 2018. HSA Children's Mental Health (CMH) will be responsible for
providing access to medically necessary mental health services for this population.
Psychiatric Health Facility
• The construction of the Santa Cruz County Psychiatric Health Facility and the Behavioral
Health Evaluation and Treatment Center is scheduled to be completed with operations
beginning January 1, 2014.
Human Services Department (HSD)
Healthcare Reform
• HSD efforts, including expanded staff and critical technology enhancement to support
increased program demands due to healthcare reform and increased Cal Fresh
participation were started in 2012-13 and will continue through 2013-14.

County Clerk
May 3, 2013
4
Two elections are scheduled for 2013-14, the November 5th Uniform District Election and the
June 3rd Gubernatorial Primary Election. The Primary will include contests for Superior Court
judges and a number of local County offices including Supervisors in the 3rd and 4th Districts.
Over 50% of eligible voters are expected to vote by mail. This budget includes the purchase of
equipment to automate the processing of these ballots which will both contain processing costs
and speed the tallying and reporting of mail ballots.
Planning
Significant projects for 2013-14 include the Draft Sustainable Community and Transit Corridor
Plan, a Draft CEMEX Site Re-Use Plan, and a Draft Economic Development Strategy.
Public Defender
In 2013-14 and ongoing, savings are anticipated in the cost of discovery due to the
implementation of a new discovery delivery system in the District Attorney's office.
CONCLUSION
The 2013-14 Recommended Budget makes some progress towards attaining financial stability
and structural balance. It is important to note that it does not provide funds to increase the
County's reserves, which remain at the minimum level established by your Board. Priority
facility maintenance projects, currently estimated at a cost of approximately $5 million, are again
being deferred into the future.
I would like to take this opportunity to recognize the contributions of the County staff and their
efforts to deliver essential services to the public with reduced resources. The recommendations
set forth below do not represent adoption of the County Budget, but the approval of the budget
estimates as a basis for full consideration at the time of final budget hearings scheduled to
begin on June 17, 2013.
IT IS THEREFORE RECOMMENDED that your Board approve the figures in this document as
those that constitute the Proposed County Budget for 2013-14, order publication of the required
notices, and set June 17, 2013 as the date the Public Hearings on the 2013-14 Proposed
County Budget will begin.
