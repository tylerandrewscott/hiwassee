Marin County is dedicated to being a responsive, open, and community-focused government. Working with our community partners, we deliver a wide range of services. From providing health insurance to someone who was previously uninsured to responding to a natural disaster from our new state-of-the-art public safety building, we are always striving to make Marin a safer and more equitable community.
Fiscal year 2015-16 is the second year of our two-year budget. The proposed budget is largely consistent with our approved plan. Our goal in preparing the budget was to practice the same financial discipline in good times that we did during the economic downturn. We see the improved economy as an opportunity to focus on long-term trends, maintain current service levels, pay down our unfunded retiree obligations, increase investments in our road and facility infrastructure and set aside reserves for future uncertainties. Overall, the budget is increasing by just over six percent. To avoid future shortfalls, the budget continues our practice of matching one-time revenues with one-time expenses.
Proposed operating budget changes supported by ongoing revenues:
•
Increases in expenditures for cost-covered positions as well as increases for cost-of-living adjustments for salaries, employee healthcare, workers' compensation and required pension contributions
•
$12 million in discretionary payments to our retiree health trust above pay-as-you-go
•
$10.4 million for increases in mental health services funded by state and federal funds, including $3.9 million in additional General Fund support
•
$4.9 million in increased appropriations for social services largely supported by state and federal revenues
•
$1 million in additional General Fund support for road maintenance to offset losses in state and federal gas tax revenues
Proposed project expenditures/reserves supported by one-time revenues:
•
$4.0 million transfer into the Road and Bridge Rehabilitation fund
•
$1.1 million for Hall of Justice space renovations
•
$1.0 million for capital costs related to a new community detox facility
•
$825,000 for departmental one-time budget change proposals (BCPs)
•
$750,000 for various one-time technology upgrades
Because of our past decisions to reduce ongoing spending, the budget is balanced and is structurally sound. It maintains current service levels and makes one-time investments to address your Board's priorities. This past year, all three independent bond rating agencies affirmed Marin County's AAA rating, citing a strong local economy, sound fiscal management and a proactive approach to reducing unfunded retiree liabilities.
In fact, we have reduced our retiree liabilities by $233 million over the past three years due to strong investment earnings and over $75 million in accelerated payments. The budget includes an additional $14 million above the required retiree contributions, including $12 million to our retiree health trust and an additional $2.0 million to our pension rate stabilization reserve.
Recommended FY 2014-15 One-Time Allocations
In addition to the one-time allocations contained in the proposed FY 2015-16 budget, we are recommending that the FY 2014-15 state repayment of pre-2004 mandate costs be allocated to reserves for roads, buildings, pensions and future uncertainties. The Governor's May Revise budget includes a one-time payment of $11.6 million. We are recommending that these one-time funds be allocated as follows:
•
$4.1 million into a facility improvement reserve
•
$3.5 million increase to the General Fund contingency reserve
•
$2.0 million increase to the pension rate stabilization reserve
•
$2.0 million into a Road and Bridge Fund reserve
As the economy has improved, property tax and sales tax revenues have rebounded. Overall, we are recommending a 6 percent increase in expenditures over the prior year. Increases in ongoing revenues are fully offset by increases in the cost of maintaining current service levels, including increasing costs for salaries, benefits, mental health and road maintenance. Significant adjustments to our FY 2015-16 budget plan are discussed below.
Increased Property Tax Revenue
Property taxes are the largest single source of discretionary revenue for the County's General Fund. During the recent recession, the slowdown in the housing market caused property tax revenues to flatten. With median single family home prices again nearing $1 million, the continued strength in the housing market has now increased our annual revenue growth projections to 6.8 percent, or approximately $5 million over our planned amount.
Increased Required Pension Contributions
Although investment earnings have been relatively strong in recent years, the County's costs for pension benefits are increasing due to updated investment and demographic assumptions implemented by the Marin County Employees' Retirement Association (MCERA) Board. Earlier this year, MCERA analyzed their assumptions regarding the expected future rate of investment returns and voted to reduce the earnings assumption by 0.25 percent, from 7.50 percent to 7.25 percent. In addition, the MCERA Board voted to implement updated actuarial mortality assumptions since retirees are living longer. Reducing the discount rate to 7.25% and updating mortality assumptions have increased the County's annual required contributions by approximately $2 million.
Increased Workers Compensation Costs
Over the past three years, required annual contributions to our workers compensation fund have increased by over $6 million and are nearly $3 million above last year's budget. The increase is primarily attributable to higher cost claims for public safety workers. Legislative changes have expanded the scope of public safety injuries and illnesses that are presumed to be work-related. Specifically, public safety employees are now covered for all cancers and heart conditions, and the presumption has been extended from five to ten years after employment for incidents of cancer. County staff is engaged in a more coordinated case management approach to help mitigate our risk going forward, including additional training and a review of policies and procedures.
To be a responsive government, we must adapt to new community needs, understand major trends, and encourage a culture of innovation. Despite our improved fiscal outlook, there are significant emerging needs that we will need to address over the next five years.
Income Inequality and Equity Gaps in Health, Education and Jobs
As the County's safety net, we know all too well that not everyone is sharing in the benefits of an improving economy. The
proportion of residents living below self-sufficiency levels has actually increased because wages for lower-income workers
have not kept pace with the cost of necessities such as housing.
On an overall basis, the County ranks highest in California in health and life expectancy. Unemployment is the second lowest in the state, and median income is the highest. But within the County there are differences among our communities that require greater focus. For example, life expectancy can vary by as much as 17 years within the County and the number of Marin households living below the self-sufficiency standard has increased 28 percent since 2007. Furthermore, we know that those who don't attend preschool are much more likely to have difficulty reading by the third grade and will be at risk of dropping out of high school.
The County has responded to the gaps in equity in various ways over the past few years. Increasing the living wage, working with community partners such as Marin Kids and Marin Promise, and reducing Park and Library fees have all been positive steps in the right direction. Expanding access to quality healthcare has also been a considerable success. Since the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in 2014, 27,000 Marin applications have been approved for health insurance and Marin's Medi-Cal program has increased by 71 percent.
We are now working with our community partners to make investments in early childhood education and college readiness. An investment in early childhood education is not only the right thing to do but it will save society millions of dollars in future costs in the areas of criminal justice, social services and healthcare.
Changing Demographics- Older, More Diverse Community
Marin residents are approximately 10 years older than the rest of the state and the fastest growing segment of our community is over the age of 65. As our community changes, we need to ensure that we are meeting the needs of older residents.
The Department of Health and Human Services recently completed an update to the Marin County Area Plan for Aging 2012-2016 that incorporates a community-wide planning process, known as the Aging Action Initiative, to develop expanded aging services infrastructure. Over the next year, Health and Human Services will be working with our community partners to develop new initiatives and performance metrics to ensure that we are responding to our highest needs in the community. Work groups are currently analyzing strategies to address mental health, dementia, nutrition, care coordination and economic disparity.
Changing Workforce & Technology
Over the past year, County employees have been engaged in the creation of a Five Year Business Plan designed to improve our services and better support our workforce. The plan will identify strategies and actions to respond to the expected retirements of one in three employees over the next five years. It will also help inform technology investments so that we can meet the rapidly changing expectations of our residents and our workforce for modern customer service practices.
The coming year will also bring important focus to business improvement efforts, including implementation of a new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system to replace SAP. An important part of this implementation will be to use this system replacement project as the opportunity to change our business processes to better reflect public service best practices.
This budget also includes one-time technology investments to begin to meet the growing expectations of our residents and employees. For example, the budget will include funding for investments in applications to help our residents better access County services such as business license applications, finding a polling place, building permit applications, or a mobile County Fair application to guide visitors in locating events, exhibits and vendors. We are also investing is the creation of more fillable forms on the County website.
Aging Road and Building Infrastructure
The County maintains 419 miles of road, consisting of 1,100 lane miles. Maintaining infrastructure for all modes of public mobility is an essential service and affects nearly every county resident. Our recent investments have yielded results as we have improved our Pavement Condition Index from 49 to 60. Nonetheless, to make further progress we will need to increase our annual investment. We are allocating an additional $7 million above our General Fund requirement for road maintenance and improvements.
The County owns 44 buildings and the majority are over 20 years old and in need of significant repairs and upgrades. The Civic Center roof and the Woodacre Fire Headquarters both require significant up-front investments to remain structurally sound. Your Board recently authorized County staff to pursue debt-financing options that would provide the up-front funding for repairs at these and other locations. In addition, we are recommending that $4.1 million be placed into a reserve for future building improvements.
Overview of Expenditures and Revenues
The FY 2015-16 Proposed Budget for all funds is $519 million, an increase of 6.11% overall. The Proposed General Fund budget, which is the primary fund for most County programs and services, is increasing by 5.37% to $414 million. The budget is balanced and reflects sound financial practices - for example, using ongoing revenues to support ongoing expenditures while using onetime revenues to support one-time spending. With a required use of prior year fund balance of $28.0 million for FY 2015-16, approximately $20 million is required for ongoing General Fund operations. Much of the spending increase recommended for FY 2015-16 is related to increased state and federal funding for safety net services.
Significant Baseline Adjustments Included in the Recommended Budget
Health and Human Services
Supported by state and federal funding for health services, the proposed Health and Human Services General Fund budget has increased by 8 percent, or $13.8 million. The increased services levels are primarily attributable to increased funding for mental health services as approved by your Board in the Mental Health Services Act Three-Year Program, and increased funding for Medi-Cal services.
Sheriff-Coroner
The proposed Sheriff-Coroner budget includes $500,000 in ongoing revenues and expenditures resulting from an agreement with the Central Marin Police Authority for the County to provide dispatch services. The agreement included an addition of 5.0 FTE, and is fully cost-covered by revenue from the Central Marin Police Authority.
Information Services and Technology
Baseline funding for networking costs is increased by approximately $275,000 for costs related to the opening of the new Marin Commons Emergency Operation Facility and increased PC Lease spending to replace obsolete computers.
Budget Change Proposals (BCP's)
As in previous years, departments submitted Budget Change Proposals (BCPs) to request additional funds for departmental operational needs. Given our limited ability to fund new initiatives, we are very selective in recommending new positions and expenses. Positions recommended below are extra hire or limited term, consistent with the one-time or short-term duration of the recommended projects.
The Proposed Budget recommends $1,575,000 in total BCP funding for FY 2015-16. Of this amount, a total of $826,000 is for onetime department expenses and $749,000 is for one-time technology investments. A total of 5.0 limited-term FTE positions are recommended to complete the short-term duration of the associated projects. For ongoing purposes, recommended General Fund expenditures total $645,000 and each BCP is cost-covered by increased revenue or other expenditure reductions. General Fund allocations will be included in the Non-Departmental budget for allocation during the year.
FY 2015-16 One-Time Allocations for Emerging Issues
General Fund one-time sources of approximately $8 million are being used to support one-time spending for FY 2015-16. In addition to the $1.5 million in recommended one-time BCP's detailed above, FY 2015-16 one-time allocations are recommended for the following uses:
•
$4.0 million for needed maintenance of County roads and bridges consistent with your Board's policy to reserve 50% of any available year-end General Fund balance in excess of what's required to support the General Fund operating budget (five percent of budget, or approximately $20 million) to address deferred road and bridge maintenance. This allocation represents the third of a five-year policy commitment.
•
$1.1 million for Hall of Justice renovations of the vacated Civic Center office space
•
$1.0 million for the County's contribution toward a detox facility
•
$200,000 for childcare and preschool scholarships
•
$125,000 for SMART Station improvements
Conclusion
This past fall, the County partnered with OpenGov to publish budget data in an open and transparent way that allows residents to explore and understand financial data in a variety of formats. For years, the County has published budgetary and financial data online, but with the new web-based platform, the public can now examine the line-item details and trends in a more user-friendly and interactive manner. Please visit www.marincounty.org/openbudget to learn more about the County's budget and financial information.
The County is on more stable footing because of the actions taken by your Board over the past several years. We need to continue our efforts to innovate and to improve how we provide critical community services. I look forward to working with your Board, our employees and the public to achieve our shared goal of making our community safer, healthier and more sustainable.
I want to thank your Board and all of our employees for their leadership, collaboration and support. In particular, I want to recognize the efforts of the Department of Finance, Information Services and Technology, and the Department of Public Works for their assistance in the preparation of this budget. Most importantly, I would like to recognize my staff for their significant contributions, thoughtfulness and dedication throughout this budget process.
