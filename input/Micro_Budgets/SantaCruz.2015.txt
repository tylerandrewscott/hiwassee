Resolving assessment appeals from 2014 will be a priority for the appraisal staff. Appeals require an appraiser to make an independent analysis of the market value of each property and attend the Assessment Appeals Board at a hearing if not resolved with the property owner. All pending appeals are expected to be resolved by December 2015.

In 2015-16, the Assessor expects to complete the work with the Auditor-Controller, Treasurer-Tax Collector, and Information Services on refinements to the new property tax system. The new system enables staff to produce the assessment roll sooner by computerizing processes previously done manually.The Auditor-Controller-Treasurer-Tax Collector's Office will focus significant attention and staffing to refine the new ONESolution financial system to take advantage of many new features including electronic document processing, which is expected to improve efficiency. Phase II of the ONESolution software will be implemented, including the budgeting and remaining financial modules.

The office will fully implement a Cannabis Business Tax (CBT) and Transient Occupancy Tax (TOT) online registration, statement and payment system that will facilitate revenue collection, enhance efficiency in existing processes and support the Audit function. Additional staffing and funding has been included in this budget to provide for both internal and external auditing of the CBT and TOT receipts.

The Central Collections Section will implement a Franchise Tax Board Court Ordered Debt software module that will produce efficiencies in the collections processes and enhance revenues.In 2015-16, Purchasing anticipates processing approximately 4,500 requisitions and purchase orders for county-wide expenditures of approximately $22 million. The focus of the division continues to be on management of processes and procedures including strategic purchasing to increase leverage in the County’s purchasing power, “Green Procurement" of environmentally friendly and energy-reducing products, and pursuing collaborative strategies to achieve more efficient and effective purchasing operations with both risk management and cost savings as top priorities.

The Purchasing division will continue to work with the Auditor-Controller-Treasurer-Tax Collector’s office and the Information Services Department to ensure the successful implementation of ONESolution, the County’s new fully-integrated financial management and procurement system. In conjunction with this implementation, the division will continue to evaluate and revise purchasing procedures and provide training to County departments to maximize efficiencies within ONESolution.In 2015-16, the Service Center will continue to focus on increasing customer satisfaction and work efficiencies. Priorities include providing prompt maintenance and repair, reducing the number of vehicles assigned to departments, increasing the efficiency of checking out vehicles, increasing the ratio of alternative fuel vehicles in the fleet and increasing the number of employee van pools. •	Retire the County's legacy Financial and Purchasing systems and shutdown the mainframe system to realize an annualized savings of $500,000 in software and support costs.

Construction of Phase I of the Seacliff Village Park, the Quail Hollow Brook Restoration Project and re-roofing the Felton Covered Bridge are planned during fiscal year 2015-16. The impacts of continuing drought for Santa Cruz County to parks maintenance and use are unclear at this time and will be addressed in future reports when they are better understood.

The Planning Department plans to make substantial progress or complete a number of policy efforts initiated in prior years, including:

•	Complete CEQA review of proposed amendments to County Code Chapters 13.10 (Zoning Regulations) and 18.10 (Permit Processes) to consolidate information related to land use types, update use charts, and amend certain development standards and procedures to streamline permit processes as appropriate. Initiate public hearings and submit County-adopted amendments to the California Coastal Commission for consideration.

•	Complete the Housing Element Update and submit to State HDC for certification in December.
