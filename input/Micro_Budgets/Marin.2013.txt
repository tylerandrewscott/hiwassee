FY 2013-14 Initiatives
•
Continued support of restorative justice efforts in the community, such as Victim/Offender Restorative Justice Program (VORP) and United for Restorative Justice, a Canal community group
Key Challenges and Outstanding Issues
In FY 2013-2014, a critical challenge will be the decline in revenue from SB 678 funding received from the state. The Probation Department initially received $269,625 in startup money to be used to enhance the department's usage of Evidence Based Practices and software upgrades. Subsequent year awards were allocated amongst all California counties based on the proven ability of each county to reduce the number of prison commitments. In the first year of performance awards, Marin was identified as a “High Performing” agency and was rewarded a one year award that well exceeded our initial funding. In year two of performance awards Marin was still one of a diminishing number of counties that were classified as “High Performing” earning the County an allocation comparable to the funding of the High Performance grant received the previous year. These funds have been used exclusively for treatment for Adult offenders which helps drive down costs for other County agencies. The Governor's January budgetary proposal is seeking a reduction in SB678 funds at approximately 70%. Chief Probation Officers of California (CPOC) will be working with the Governor's office to advocate for previous funding levels.
Staffing presents challenges as well, with approximately 41% of the staff in the Department having less than five years of experience as regular-hire employees. Additionally, 17% of the department has 20 years or greater of experience and are potentially retirement eligible. The department is preparing for these challenges by initiating an employee orientation program as part of the on-boarding process as well as providing additional training to prepare staff for leadership roles. We will be working closely with Human Resources to address these needs.
Further staffing challenges include workspace planning. The immediate impact of the uncertainty at Juvenile Services with either building renovation work taking place during business hours, the prospect of temporarily moving staff to portable buildings, or offsite altogether has presented great uncertainty and will be disruptive to providing service to youth and families.
The Juvenile Hall facility expects to update some security concerns as well as modernize the interior bringing them up to industry standards. This is a constant struggle as the facility was built in the 1960's.
Lastly, the Civic Center currently does not provide enough office space for existing staff which requires the department to rent space at another location. This disrupts continuity and the ability for staff to meet on a regular basis.The department will work with the County Administrator to address these issues during the next year.
•
•
Description: Eliminate 2.0 FTE vacant Deputy Probation Officer II position in conjunction with the Voluntary Separation Incentive Program (VSIP). In addition, eliminate 1.0 vacant Deputy probation Officer and 1.0 vacant FTE Administrative Services Technician and add 1.0 FTE Deputy Probation Officer III and 1.0 FTE vacant Legal Process Specialist.
Programmatic Impacts of Proposed Changes: Efforts to streamline programs, coupled with a downward trend in case numbers makes these cuts manageable at this time. However, increases to case numbers and new mandates may make the loss of staff a detriment to the department success rate.

Key Challenges and Outstanding Issues
The Marin Superior Court is changing its court operational structure and Public Defender managers and staff are reassigning workload and court assignments to meet the demands of this restructuring.
With the passage of Proposition 36, staff members are reviewing all cases of clients who are entitled to be resentenced under the new Three Strike legislation. This review process is assisting clients in having their life sentences reduced and most are going to be released from custody.
Starting in July of 2013, public defender staff will be handling parole revocation hearings in the Marin County Superior Court. This is a dramatic change in parole revocation procedures and it is yet unclear the impact that these new procedures will have on public defender caseloads.
Reduce vacant 1.0 FTE Legal Assistant.

Key Challenges and Outstanding Issues
The search for a new Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) system is pending for the County and its partner agencies.
Finding a solution that will enable all law enforcement agencies to be on the same operating system for records management and computer aided dispatch.
The Department's mobile data computers (patrol car laptops) have reached the end of their life cycle and with costly repairs, it will be important to be able to replace this aging fleet of computers.
Description: Reduce $33,000 in Detention programs due to new Jail Bakery; Transfer 1.0 Sheriff's Service Assistant position to Inmate Jail Welfare Fund; recognize $82,852 in additional revenue from the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) associated with the reentry program; and recognize $145,000 in additional revenue to reimburse the Jail for costs associated with AB 109 offenders subject to approval from the Community Corrections Partnership (CCP) committee.
In addition to the above reductions, the proposed budget will reflect an additional $552,000 in ongoing savings achieved through elimination of Cost-of-Living-Adjustments (COLA) previously negotiated with the Deputy Sheriff's Association.
Programmatic Impacts of Proposed Changes: No anticipated impacts. The new Jail bakery will enable inmates to produce their own bread in lieu of purchasing it through a third-party vendor, while providing valuable job training skills. Transferring 1.0 FTE to a special revenue fund will not result in any change to existing service levels.

Key Challenges and Outstanding Issues
•
•
Since 1978 pressure has not been greater on assessors' offices and the property assessment system. As a result of the downturn in the economy since the end of 2007, when there was virtually no workload of assessment declines, the Assessor now has new workload of nearly 23,000 properties that require reassessment every year. Currently, some simple forecasts suggest that the bulk of the property assessments needing to be reviewed annually will continue for fifteen years or more. Combined with local and state budget pressure, local property assessments are key components in fiscal planning when property assessments begin to increase for large numbers of property owners across the state.
Increased workload demands in the areas of assessment appeals, demand for information and customer assistance, and activity in recordation due to increase in foreclosures and refinancing
In all areas of the Assessor-Recorder-County Clerk's Office, staff must stay current with consistently changing and more complex local, state, and federal regulations to ensure the County remains in compliance. This requires staff to monitor regulatory and legal changes (e.g., state and local bills); understand the implications to County policy and procedures; educate and communicate business process changes to staff; and implement new processes and policies as needed.
Over the last year, the Recorder's Office has seen an increase in workload due to refinancing and increasing numbers of real estate sales
An on-going challenge exists to maintain a competitive assessment program, compared to other counties, to maintain eligibility for future state-based Property Tax Administration Program funding.
Although the State Board of Equalization has not finalized publication of its guidelines for the assessment of new construction, it is conceivable that the Marin County Assessor will modify procedures for the assessment of certain types of new construction. While this will have the effect of simplifying assessments and possibly creating more statewide uniformity, it will also have the result of fewer new construction assessments and an accompanying decrease in potential assessment roll growth.

Through continuing efforts to consolidate and reorganize the department, enhance internal and external customer service with improved communications, business processes, and systems
Key Challenges and Outstanding Issues
Numerous key staff members with long standing institutional knowledge are currently retiring and recruiting for and training new talent will be a challenge for the next few years
Citizens are less able to pay their taxes and fees, increasing workload of staff due to the need to manage more customer issues and establish payment plans, etc.
The Administrative Technologies of Marin (ATOM) project will continue to provide both challenges and opportunities for years to come. The DOF will be challenged to maintain daily operations while using its key subject matter experts toward redesigning business policies, processes and procedures in preparation for the implementation of a new financial system, as well as identifying the requirements for a new system and participating in the procurement and selection process. Obtaining highly competent staff resources to support operations will be key to addressing this challenge.
The need to increase training, knowledge and awareness of financial and accounting regulations and processes both internally (DOF staff) and externally (operating departmental staff) in a time of reduced resources and competing priorities
Staying current with constantly changing state and federal regulations to ensure the County remains in compliance. This requires staff to:
Monitor regulatory and legal changes (e.g., General Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), Government Codes, etc.)
Understand the implications to County policy and procedures
Educate and communicate business process changes with County departments and DOF staff in a timely manner; and implement new processes and policies as needed
Description: Redesign and implement new processes for the County's Transient Occupancy Tax (TOT) program, anticipated to increase the collections of Transient Occupancy Tax revenue from lodging operators subject to the provisions of California Revenue and Taxation Code 7280 and Marin County Ordinance Code Chapter 3.05.030. The new work program will not increase TOT rates, but is anticipated to increase collections with enhanced auditing and compliance procedures.
Programmatic Impacts of Proposed Changes: Department of Finance staff will be trained and assigned to support the new process on an ongoing basis. A portion of the increased revenues will offset the cost of a 1.0 FTE Auditor II position effective October 1, 2013 to enhance internal auditing and compliance procedures.

FY 2013-14 Initiatives
Continue staff training program focusing on high priority program and core business areas
Continue to use networked talent-based teams for implementation of key initiatives
Key Challenges and Outstanding Issues
Overall trends in construction permitting reflect a gradual improvement in the economy. Given the staff reductions that have occurred over the past several years, the Agency will focus on enhancing the development review program to improve its customer service satisfaction levels and maintain fee-based revenues. Realigning constituent expectations for delivery of services with staffing constraints will be a challenge in the next fiscal year, particularly if the volume of permitting activity increases.
The Agency is in the midst of implementing a new automated permit tracking system designed to improve work flow and permit-related information to the public. The demands placed on staff for assisting with business process integration, system design and system testing have and will continue to compete with available staff time for core business functions. The ability of managers and supervisors to assist staff with time management and project management will be essential to ensuring steady progress with implementation of the permit tracking system while also achieving an acceptable level of customer service in other high priority work areas.
Although the most recent update of the Countywide Plan reflects a comprehensive integration of sustainability principles and practices, there is a growing need to build upon the Countywide Plan and Greenhouse Gas Reduction Plan by providing updated climate change adaptation strategies that respond to Marin's local conditions and opportunities as well as balance competing policy
objectives.
When the Board of Supervisors adopted an implementation plan for the Analysis of Impediments to Fair Housing Choice (AI) in October 2011, it signified the County's commitment to reafirming fair housing, as well as affordable housing, as important public policy objectives and to reinforce social equity as one of the Three E's guiding the County's sustainability goals. Effectively promoting fair housing will require the County and other local jurisdictions to overcome barriers that have been identified in the AI.
The 2007 update of the Countywide Plan contains over 400 programs, a number of which involve work products from the Agency to implement policies according to a predetermined schedule. Due to a reduction in staffing, as well as the ambitious nature of the Countywide Plan's implementation schedule, the Agency will not be able to implement all programs according to their respective time frames for completing work. Staff will therefore be recommending adjustments to the implementation schedule based on a contemporary and more realistic assessment of the Agency's workload capacity.
Description: Recognize residual $29,407 ongoing savings from deletion of vacant Deputy Director of Planning Services position to offset the General fund absorption in FY 2013-14 of 1.05 FTE Building and Safety Special Revenue Fund staffing resources. In addition, reduce expenditures in the amount of $50,000 related to extra hire budget and $18,000 related to Professional Services budget.
Programmatic Impacts of Proposed Changes: Reducing Professional Services will limit the department's capacity to pay for additional services associated with Current Planning's development review services and permit review cycle targets during periods of high permit activity, potentially requiring onetime funding requests as needed for development review projects.

with Long Term Restructuring goals for the Transportation
Program, recognize $181,588 in new ongoing revenue
commitments from the Non-Motorized Transportation Grant
Fund and Flood Control Districts for staff work relating to
transportation projects. In addition, reduce $164,269 in
expenditures in Communications, Engineering, and Land Use
programs.
Programmatic Impacts of Proposed Changes: Reduction of
1.0 FTE through the VSIP will result in increased workload for
remaining staff.The department does not anticipate any
impacts relating to the revenue increases. The Department
may, however, return to the Board to seek additional one-time
funds for specific project or equipment needs in the
Communications or Land Use programs as project requests
are unable to be supported within baseline funding.

Develop a plan to decentralize open space field operations and create satellite field offices combining parks, open space and landscape services staffs to increase community familiarity with local parks staff and vice versa, reduce travel time to work sites, and improve project outcomes through sharing of material resources and staff talents
Develop, design, and complete a Marin County Parks annual report pursuant to Measure A, providing a transparent overview of expenditures and accomplishments for the public
With the passage of Measure A come many responsibilities in carrying out its mandates and implementing the requirements of the new tax. This includes designing meaningful programs, establishing a more complex budget, establishing an independent citizens oversight committee, and creating a reporting and accounting system while reflecting the wishes of the public.
The department has 11 citizen advisory committees and boards to support, including the independent citizens oversight committee for Measure A. Each of these boards and committees is subject to the Brown Act, which entails a significant administrative workload to create agendas, publically notice the meetings, take and post minutes, and staff the meetings. Additional workload implications include participation by senior management and providing support to the 80 citizens who serve on these bodies.
Our open space preserve system is, by design, distributed throughout the county and among residential areas where fire hazard exists and from which most fire ignition originates. We work with 14 separate fire agencies to manage fire fuels in the various communities and neighborhoods. There are disparate views on the management of those fuels and on optimum fire prevention and protection methods, which requires the department to weigh the benefits of these measures, collaborate with colleagues in the fire agencies, and sometimes mediate disputes, especially in light of the department’s mission to protect and responsibly steward the natural resources within the preserves while doing its part to promote the safety of communities.
The inexorable spread of non-native invasive weeds imperils native vegetation, threatens the integrity of wildlife habitat, and exacerbates fire fuel loads.
Park and preserve visitation is up, which requires more staff time to keep visitors safe, monitor conditions, and manage lands and facilities.
Unlawful, damaging, and/or unsafe use of the preserves continues and constitutes a serious dilemma and burden to the rangers, especially in the evening and nighttime hours when rangers are not present.
Description: Recognize $30,000 in additional revenue derived from McInnis Buildings and Grounds Rental agreement; Reduce $23,500 in contract expenses from the Landscape Services budget; Reduce $9,802 in professional services expenses from the Parks Facilities budget for maintenance and repair work. Reduce 1.0 FTE Landscape Services Worker II through the County’s Voluntary Separation Incentive Program (VSIP). In addition, reduce 1.0 Supervising Open Space Park Ranger from Open Space fund 20600 through VSIP.

Key Challenges and Outstanding Issues
Grants may be available for implementation of restoration projects, and the Marin County Board of Supervisors has committed funding for the initial environmental impact report, but full funding to develop project plans and ensure compliance with environmental review and permitting requirements continues to be a challenge, frustrating committee and community members who want more timely restoration
Significant time and commitment will be required of non-agency members to review and provide meaningful comments on plans for lagoon restoration
Members of the BLAC and surrounding communities are passionate about protection of the lagoon. Sometimes these passions and frustration about process caused discord at meetings that undermined meaningful, thoughtful public and agency participation. There were concerns that newcomers to the area or to the restoration project were discouraged from participating in the public process.
Meetings of the former Bolinas Lagoon Technical Advisory Committee sometimes served as a forum for matters not within the purview of the committee. This led to frustration for committee members and the public, and diverted the committee's focus. It is hoped that reformulating the committee into the BLAC and reaffirming the purpose of the group will resolve this concern.
Meet a minimum two times per year (June for training and December for elections) in addition to any meetings scheduled for the purpose of hearing building appeals

For the upcoming reporting year of FY 2012-13, there are a number of new Government Accounting Standards Board (GASB) Statements regarding financial reporting that will go into effect during FY 2012-13, and therefore must be reflected in the County's FY 2012-13 CAFR. Accordingly, the committee must monitor these changes to financial reporting in order to obtain reasonable assurance that they were properly implemented by County management.

The transition will be underway during FY 2013-2014. The move requires strategic planning and careful execution, particularly when it comes to the legal collection. Because our new space will be two-thirds the size of our current location, the library has to reduce part of its collection to accommodate smaller quarters.

Internal Excellence
FY 2013-14 Initiatives

Maintain regular meetings with staff for improved communication
Key Challenges and Outstanding Issues
MWC is aware of the fiscal challenges faced by the County and is extremely grateful for the budget allotment for MWC activities and programs. We request that the Board of Supervisor and County Administrator continue to give full consideration to maintaining the budget for MWC, as it has in the last few fiscal years.
MWC has part-time staff that is shared with Human Rights Commission and the HR Department. The commission would benefit greatly from full-time staff that would take our work to another level of accomplishment. Several Bay Area women's commissions are staffed with full-time Executive Directors, e.g. San Francisco.
Translation and interpretation continue to be underfunded in our budget. These line items allow for MWC may have its materials and events properly communicated to the underserved women and girls in our county.
While we are seeing an interest in training for the internal excellence of MWC and other county commissions, there are other areas for training that the Women's Commission could benefit, namely cultural competence, diversity and social media training
Several years ago the commission was reduced to 11 commissioners (2 per District plus 1 at-large). This small number of commissioners greatly reduces our effectiveness in the community and gives us less opportunity to have a diverse group of women on the commission.
