This budget is recommended at $2,795,406.
The General Fund provides 49.6% of the
financing for the Department, and is
increased by $307,996 (28.6%) compared to
FY 2014-15.
It is recommended to replace one aging
pickup truck.
The Ag Commissioner’s Department was
granted use of General Government Impact
Fee (0-101) funds in prior years to help
offset the cost of a facility expansion
project, with the understanding that 40% of
the funds would be reimbursed to the Fund
using any unanticipated Unclaimed Gas Tax
revenue. Excess Unclaimed Gas Tax
revenue is to be used first to make progress
toward repayment, prior to being used for
extra projects or purchases. There is no
recommended repayment to the General
Government Impact Fee fund in FY 2015-16
because Unclaimed Gas Tax revenue is
anticipated to decrease this year. The
current balance owed to the General
Government Impact Fee fund is $122,167.
This budget is recommended at $167,500, of
which $160,000 is for a replacement Weight
Truck. This budget unit does not receive
any funding directly from the General Fund;
however, $17,500 (an increase of $11,250),
which is Sutter County’s portion of the
Maintenance and Replacement costs, is
budgeted as an Interfund expense in the
Agricultural Commissioner’s budget unit
(2-601). The rest of the funding is provided
by revenues collected from Yuba and
Nevada Counties.
Due to current California Air Resources
Board requirements, the County is required
to replace this vehicle by the year 2020.
Over the past three years, the Administrative
Committee has been developing a plan for
the replacement of this vehicle. The
Committee is recommending increasing
contributions into these accounts in order to
purchase this replacement vehicle this fiscal
year. The estimated cost of the replacement
is $160,000, which includes purchase of the
vehicle, fabrication, installation of a new
bed (due to safety concerns), and
transferring of existing articulating crane.
Other factors driving the decision to replace
the vehicle in FY 2015-16 are: (1) 5%
annual appreciation in the cost of a new
vehicle, (2) safety concerns with existing
truck bed and load securement, and
(3) increasing on-going maintenance costs
with the existing vehicle.
An update to the JPA will need to be
developed and approved by the member
jurisdictions and will be presented to the
Board for consideration at a later date.
This budget is recommended at $213,438. The
General Fund provides 63% of the financing
for this budget unit and is increased $822
(0.6%) compared to FY 2014-15.
This budget is recommended at $1,243,186,
which is an increase of $76,551 (6.6%) over
FY 2014-15. The General Fund provides
69.2% of the financing for this budget and
has increased $24,831 (3%) compared to
FY 2014-15.
It is recommended that one part-time
(0.5 FTE) Library Technician position be
increased to a full time (1.0 FTE) position.
It is also recommended that funding be
restored for one (1.0 FTE) Library Assistant
I/II position. The employee currently
underfilling the Supervising Library
Technician position as a Library Assistant I will be transferred into this position
effective July 1, 2015 and the Supervising
Library Technician position will be held
vacant and unfunded.
In light of the above position increases, it is
recommended that one, currently vacant and
unfunded, Library Services Coordinator
position be permanently eliminated, and that
one Supervising Library Technician position
be left vacant and unfunded upon vacancy.
This budget is recommended at $211,956.
The General Fund provides 92.1% of the
financing for this budget and is increased
$47,485 (32.1%) compared to FY 2014-15.
The increase in the Department’s
unreimbursed cost is primarily due to onetime
payment of accrued leave balances
upon the retirement of the current, longtime,
Museum Director-Curator effective
August 30, 2015 and the hiring of a new
Museum Director-Curator at a lower step of
the salary range plus a 30-day overlap. The two County paid positions remain
funded at 80%. Museum staff have reported
that the backlog of curatorial work is
growing, indicating that day-to-day
operational duties consume a large portion
of the day, leaving little time to address
curatorial work.
Revenue from the Museum Commission is
recommended at $16,521, which covers
Extra Help staffing, postage, Services and
Supplies, General Insurance and Bonds, and
Liability Insurance Premiums. The Museum
Commission has expressed agreement with
this recommended contribution.
The County Administrative Office does not
make recommendations for funding in this
budget unit, as these funding decisions are
made solely at the discretion of the Board of
Supervisors. No amount has been budgeted
for the requested subsidies.
In FY 2014-15, a total of $15,000 was
appropriated for the following subsidy
organizations:
 Yuba-Sutter Regional Arts Council: $5,000
 The Acting Company: $5,000
 Sutter County Resource Conservation
District: $5,000
This budget is recommended at $91,522. The
General Fund provides 100% of the financing
for Sutter County’s share of the Veteran’s
Services Officer budget and remains
unchanged compared to FY 2014-15.
This recommendation reflects only Sutter
County’s net share of cost.
This budget unit is based on a Bi-County
agreement and any changes to the budget
would need to be negotiated with Yuba
County.
This budget is recommended at $637,314,
which is an increase of $118,456 (22.8%)
compared to FY 2014-15. The General
Fund provides 14.7% of the financing for
this budget unit, and is increased by $13,842
(17.4%) in FY 2015-16.
The recommended budget reflects the
transfer of three Permit Technicians into the
Administration budget unit, resulting in an
increased cost of $249,589 in this budget
unit. This cost is in turn recouped from the
Building Division budget unit (2-724)
through an Interfund charge.
It is recommended that two vacant Office
Assistant III positions be eliminated, and
that one Development Services Technician I
position and one Development Services
Technician II position be added. The
Development Services Technician is a new
classification recommended to be added in
FY 2015-16 in an effort to reflect the broad
range of administrative duties that are
required of positions in the Development
Services Department. It is the intent that the
new classification will assist the Department
in providing adequate customer service and
administrative support coverage.
The Department has requested a new
Limited Term Accountant II position to
assist with a backlog of administrative
projects. However, due to continued budget
constraints and other needs within the
County, it is recommended that no position
be added to this budget unit in this fiscal
year.
This budget is recommended at $435,748.
The General Fund does not generally
provide any operating funding for this
budget unit. However, the General Fund
contributed $185,000 to the Airport in
FY 2010-11 to fund on-going operations.
SBRAA’s proposed budget for management
of the airport includes provisions to pay
back the General Fund over time.
The total General Fund contribution to the
Airport for FY 2015-16 is recommended at
$30,211, reflecting the county’s contribution
of staff time and (A-87) Cost Plan charges.
This budget is recommended at $778,786,
which is an increase of $77,497 (11.1%)
compared to FY 2014-15.
Salaries and benefits reflect a reduction of
$36,852 due to the recommended transfer of a
portion of the Assistant Director of Development Services – Public Works
(0.2 FTE) position to the Road Fund.
The FY 2015-16 budget includes a full year of
funding for one new Associate Civil Engineer
position that was added in FY 2014-15
effective January 1, 2015. This results in an
approximate cost increase of $61,630 in
salaries and benefits accounts.
The cost for Engineering services is
recommended to be reflected in the Interfund
Engineering account beginning FY 2015-16
(previously reflected in Interfund DS Admin
account), and is increased by $215,165. This
account reflects engineering services provided
to the Road Fund and other non-General Fund
budget units.
Extra Help continues to be recommended to
fund part-time County Surveyor work.
This budget is recommended at $2,298,555.
There is no General Fund cost associated
with this budget unit. All financing is
provided by State grate revenues and Impact
Fee funds retained by the County.
Because reimbursement cannot be claimed
until the construction contract is awarded,
this budget reflects the transfer-in of funds
from the County’s Criminal Justice
Development Impact Fee fund (0-102) to
cover any required local match and to
advance funds to complete the initial phases
of the project prior to receiving
reimbursement. The Criminal Justice
Development Impact Fee fund will be
reimbursed for funds that have been
advanced once State reimbursement monies
are received.
This budget is recommended at $625,200,
which is a decrease of $62,381 (9.1%)
compared to FY 2014-15. This budget unit
does not receive any funding from the
General Fund.
The net cost of this budget unit is covered
by permit revenues and an Interfund transfer
from the Health Fund (1991 Realignment
funding). The contribution from the Health
Fund is recommended at $330,235, a
reduction of $47,929 over the prior year.
This budget is recommended at $280,307,
which is an increase of $8,556 (3.1%)

program is covered by permit revenue and
grants.
This budget includes Intrafund CUPAEnvironmental
Health charges for staff
services provided by the Environmental
Health (2-725) budget unit.
This budget is recommended at $275,379,
which is an increase of $3,820 (1.4%)
compared to FY 2014-15. The General
Fund provides 97.8% of the financing for
Fire Services Administration and is
increased by $7,320 (2.8%) compared to
FY 2014-15. This budget unit is within the
Public Safety fund; however, it is considered
to be funded primarily by the General Fund.
This budget is recommended at $653,000,
which is a decrease of $800 (0.1%)
compared to FY 2014-15. This budget unit
does not receive any funding from the
General Fund. All funding is provided
through property taxes and interest.
This budget is recommended at $2,530,149,
which is a decrease of $529,965 (17.3%)
compared to FY 2014-15. This decrease is
primarily due to capital assets that were
budgeted and purchased in FY 2014-15.
This budget unit does not receive any
funding from the General Fund. All funding
is provided through property taxes, City of
Live Oak contract revenues, and interest
earnings.
This budget is recommended at $195,900,
which is a decrease of $298,154 (60.3%)
compared to FY 2014-15. This decrease is
due to capital assets, including SCBA gear
and a Type I Fire Engine, budgeted and
purchased in FY 2014-15. This budget unit
does not receive any funding from the
General Fund. All funding is provided
through property taxes and interest.
This budget is recommended at $253,900,
which is a decrease of $289,259 (53.3%)
compared to FY 2014-15. This decrease is
due to capital assets that were budgeted and
purchased in FY 2014-15. This budget unit
does not receive any funding from the
General Fund. All funding is provided
through property taxes, interest earnings,
and grant funding.

This budget is recommended at $3,181,855,
which is a decrease of $434,299 (12.0%)
compared to FY 2014-15. The General
Fund provides 38.2% of the financing for
this budget unit and is increased by $35,359
(3.0%) for FY 2015-16.
The recommended budget reflects the
transfer of two Permit Technician (2.0 FTE)
positions and one Senior Permit Technician
(1.0 FTE) position to the Administration
budget unit, resulting in a decreased cost of
$249,589 in this budget unit. The cost for
permit technician staff work recouped from
the Building Division budget unit (2-724)
through an Interfund charge.
It is recommended the Deputy Director of
Planning and Building position remain
vacant and unfunded through FY 2015-16.
This results in a cost reduction of
approximately $140,080. These duties
continue to be shared by other Department
management staff, including the Director of
Development Services.
Due to a continued need for building
inspection services, it is recommended the
authorization for a Limited Term Building
Inspector II position be extended through
FY 2015-16. The Limited Term Building
Inspector II was first approved in FY 2013-14.
This Limited Term position is funded in
concept with savings from leaving the
Deputy Director position vacant and
unfunded through FY 2015-16, and results
in a relative cost decrease of approximately
$48,165.
The Department has requested a new Code
Enforcement Officer position citing an
increase in code enforcement compliance
laws and regulations. However, due to
continued budget constraints and other
needs within the County, it is recommended
that no position be added to this budget unit
in this fiscal year.
This budget is recommended at $9,446,164,
which is an increase of $173,245 (1.9%)
compared to FY 2014-15. The Road Fund
budget unit does not receive any funding
support from the General Fund.
Capital Assets are recommended at
$300,500 to purchase the following items:

 $31,000 Replacement Utility Bed
Truck
 $27,000 Replacement ¾ Ton Truck
 $32,500 Re-budget of Replacement
4x4 Truck with Tow
Attachment
Because the construction season spans two
fiscal years, the Recommended Budget includes funding and appropriations for the
carryover of selected construction projects
originally budgeted in the previous fiscal
year and may contain portions of the
previous fiscal year Road Plan.
The FY 2015-16 Recommended Budget
includes the following Road Plan projects as
adopted by the Board of Supervisors for
FY 2015-16 (attached):
 2016 Road Seals
 Various Streets in and around the
town of Meridian, including
Grading/Paving
 Various ADA Project Sidewalk
Reconstruction
The State Highway Users Tax
Apportionment (HUTA) revenues are based
on current market conditions. The revenues
from HUTA sections 2104, 2105 and 2106
fund most of the in-house road program, and
HUTA section 2103 is used to provide a
portion of the major maintenance and
rehabilitation programs in the Road Plan.
State and Federal highway program and
grant funds, when available, are also applied
to this endeavor.
Annually, the County receives a portion of
the Local Transportation Fund (LTF) under
the Transportation Development Act (TDA).
These funds are available for roadwork after
public transportation needs have been met.
Under an agreement with the Yuba–Sutter
Transportation Agency, an allocation of
funds is made to the County, which is used
for general road maintenance and repairs.
The annual amount available depends on
State revenues and is estimated at $730,000
for FY 2015-16.
The County may also receive $278,075 in
State funds under a sub-program of Regional
Surface Transportation Program (RSTP); an
exchange for Federal funds. This is an
annual amount provided to some counties
and is being considered for elimination by
the State.
The position transfers (Assistant Director –
Public Works, Public Works Maintenance
Supervisor I, and Public Works Maintenance
Worker II), as described above, are
recommended to be effective July 1, 2015.
This budget unit is recommended at $109,112,
which is a decrease of $14,731 (11.9%)
compared to FY 2014-15. This budget unit
does not receive any funding from the General
Fund. Funding for this program comes from
the County’s share of the LTF and is used to
fund unmet transit needs as required by State
law. 
This budget is recommended at $67,094,
which is an increase of $1,490 (2.3%)
compared to FY 2014-15. This budget unit
does not receive financing from the General
Fund. The District receives its funding from
ad valorem property taxes on properties
within the district.

which is a decrease of $8,630 (27.2%)
compared to FY 2014-15. The General
Fund does not provide any financing for this
budget unit.
This budget unit is recommended at $395,895,
which is a decrease of $419,522 (51.4%)
compared to FY 2014-15.
Recommended salaries and benefits have been
reduced by $210,243 to reflect the
recommended transfer of one Public Works
Maintenance Worker II position and one
Public Works Maintenance Supervisor I
position from the Water Resources budget to
the Road Fund (3-100) budget unit.
Salaries and benefits also reflects a reduction
of $36,852 due to the recommended transfer
of a portion of the Assistant Director of
Development Services – Public Works
(0.2 FTE) position to the Road Fund (3-100)
budget unit.
It is also recommended that one vacant and
unfunded Public Works Equipment Operator
position be permanently eliminated from the
Water Resources position allocation schedule.
Approximately 80% of the funding for
services provided under the Water Resources
Engineering program is provided by the
General Fund. The remainder is provided
primarily through reimbursements from
special districts that receive services from
Water Resources staff.
The Water Resources division is currently
managing active contracts for specialized
water and drainage related projects. The
projects are funded through the Professional
and Specialized Services account. That
account is currently recommended at $15,000
for FY 2015-16. It may be necessary for staff
to return to your Board during FY 2015-16 to
request additional funds, or to request a
re-budget of current contract funds, if these
projects are not completed by June 30, 2015.
It is likely that the division will return to your
Board during FY 2015-16 to request
additional funding to support new contracts
related to these on-going project.
This budget is recommended at $28,500,
which is a decrease of $149,700 compared
to FY 2014-15. The General Fund provides
100% of the financing for this budget unit.

not receive any funding from the General
Fund.
This budget is recommended at $117,125,
which is an increase of $2,150 (1.9%)
compared to FY 2014-15. This budget unit
does not receive any funding from the
General Fund. All funding is provided
through tax assessments.

budget unit does not receive any funding from
the General Fund.
The FY 2015-16 budget for Waterworks
District No. 1 totals $218,408 for the water
system (01) and $263,670 for the Wastewater
Service (02). The budget reflects the total
expenditures associated with Operations &
Maintenance, Structure Improvements/Capital
Expenses, and Depreciation Expense.
The majority of the District’s expenses are
associated with maintenance and operations.
This category includes supplies and materials,
electricity, chemicals, professional services,
monitoring, state permits, repair and
maintenance expenses, staff expenses for the
operator and engineering support staff, and
other costs associated with operating the water
system. There are also administrative costs
incurred by the District, such as costs
associated with performing utility billing
services and accounting for the District.
The District is under a Compliance Order for
arsenic exceedance in the water service
program. In order to comply with the order,
the District needs to update the water
treatment plant. The FY 2012-13,
FY 2013-14, and FY 2014-15 budgets that
were approved by the District’s Board of
Directors included expenses associated with
an arsenic remediation feasibility study
associated with the design of a new water
treatment plant incorporating arsenic removal
technologies. The Consultant Agreement,
which includes design recommendations, will
expire September 2015. The major budget
changes include the change of the daily
maintenance and operation staff transferring
from the Development Services Department to
the General Services Department (this transfer
occurred in FY 2014-15). The recommended
increase in revenues is based on all current
active connections paying their monthly dues
timely as Administrative staff has been
working diligently this past year to keep the
utility billings current.
In January 2013, a new wastewater fee of
$73.50 per Equivalent Dwelling Unit (EDU)
was adopted by the District Board of Directors
in an effort to cover the actual ongoing
operations and maintenance costs associated
with operating the wastewater services for the
District. The new wastewater fee went into
effect on July 1, 2013. In November 2013, a
new monthly water fee of $70.00 per EDU for
water service was adopted by the District’s
Board of Directors. The new water fee went
into effect on January 1, 2014.
Approved services rates do not generate
enough operating revenue to cover the noncash
Depreciation Expense of $126,069 for
the wastewater system, or the Depreciation
Expense of $34,452 for the water system.
Historically, the replacement costs for
infrastructure have been provided by State
grants.
Policy Issue to Consider in FY 2015-16
The District fund has operated at a deficit for
the past decade. The Development Services
Department has been analyzing the fund, in
consultation with the Auditor-Controller’s
Office. Department staff will continue to
evaluate the Robbins water and wastewater
budget and funding structure to determine
whether the current service rates are adequate to meet on-going operations and maintenance
requirements. It is anticipated that within the
next nine months, Department staff will
develop a set of recommendations to resolve
the current negative fund balance and ongoing
deficit in the District fund. It is
expected that recommendations will be
brought to the Board of Supervisors for
consideration within this fiscal year.
This budget is recommended at $2,030,581.
The General Fund provides 99.0% of the
financing for the Department, and is
decreased by $123,118 (5.8%) compared to
FY 2014-15.
It is recommended that funding be restored
for one Assistant Assessor effective January
1, 2016. To help offset the long-term costs
of this addition, it is recommended that one
Chief Appraiser position be defunded and
held vacant following the anticipated
retirement of the incumbent, effective
August 1, 2015, and one vacant Appraiser I
be eliminated.
One promotion within a flexibly-staffed
position is recommended - one Auditor-
Appraiser I to an Auditor-Appraiser II.
There was a significant increase in the
Department’s unreimbursed cost during
FY 2014-15 that was primarily due to the
reduction in the Interfund Transfer-In from the
State-County Property Tax Program special
revenue fund (0-181). This was first budgeted
in FY 2010-11 to offset staff costs, in an effort
to avoid further budget reductions in the
Assessor’s budget unit. With the FY 2014-15
budget, it was recommended that the Interfund
Transfer-In be reduced to $16,000. The
FY 2015-16 budget recommends that the
Interfund Transfer-In be reduced to $10,500.
The recommended $10,500 will offset Extra
Help and Overtime staff costs, which are also
recommended at $10,500. The funds in this
special revenue fund reflect the remaining
balance of funds received under the State’s
former State-County Property Tax
Administration Grant Program, which was
eliminated by the State Legislature effectively
in FY 2006-07. This funding source
previously provided additional revenue to
augment staffing and for acquisition of new
equipment and technology, necessary to
enhance staff proficiency and productivity and
to eliminate backlogs. As indicated above,
these funds have been used recently to offset
regular staffing costs in the Assessor’s Office,
but those funds are now virtually depleted. It
is anticipated that the remaining balance in the
fund will be approximately $30,800 at
July 1, 2015.
This budget is recommended at $1,563,295.
The General Fund provides 99.8% of the
financing for this budget unit and is
increased by $152,010 (10.8%) compared to
FY 2014-15. A portion of the costs for this
budget unit are recouped through the annual
(A-87) Cost Plan.
Extra Help funding continues to include
$9,190 to fund approximately 624 hours of
an Account Clerk I position to perform data
entry duties which had been previously
performed by the Computer Operator in the
Information Technology Department. This
change was first implemented in
FY 2011-12.
The Sutter County Board of Supervisors has
a fiduciary duty to ensure that internal
controls are in place and functioning. The
County had previously formed an ad hoc
internal audit committee, but does not have
an internal audit policy that complies with
generally accepted government auditing
standards (GAGAS). Internal audits would
assist management with the evaluation of
internal controls used to detect or mitigate
fraud, evaluate the County’s assessment of
fraud risk, and be involved in any fraud
investigations. The Auditor-Controller has
requested that an Internal Auditor position
be added to the Department in FY 2015-16.
However, due to continued budget
constraints, it is recommended that no
position be added to this budget unit at this
time.
This budget is recommended at $327,452,
which is an increase of $1,444 (0.4%)
compared to FY 2014-15.

This budget is recommended at $157,374,
which is a decrease of $28,846 (15.5%)
compared to FY 2014-15. The General Fund
provides 58.6% of the financing for the
Clerk-Recorder’s Department and is
decreased in the Clerk of the Board budget
unit by $28,846 (15.6%) compared to
FY 2014-15.
The Recommended Budget includes a
recommendation to allocate an additional
0.05 FTE, totaling 0.15 FTE, of the County
Clerk-Recorder’s position allocation to this
budget unit. The County Clerk-Recorder’s
position allocation is similarly reduced by
0.05 FTE in the Recorder budget unit
(2-706).
In FY 2014-15, the Recommended Budget
included a Board Clerk position allocation
of 2.0 FTE, however, one position was
subsequently filled at a half-time (0.5 FTE).
The FY 2014-15 position allocation
schedule reflects the half-time allocation.
The FY 2015-16 Recommended Budget
formalizes this change, recommending
1.5 FTE Board Clerk positions to be
allocated and funded.
This budget is recommended at $806,361,
which is an increase of $26,771 (3.4%)
compared to FY 2014-15. The General
Fund provides 58.6% of the financing for
the Clerk-Recorder’s Department and is
increased in the Elections budget unit by
$40,871 (5.9%) compared to FY 2014-15.
Previous budgets have included funding for
smaller, less frequent landowner and utility
district elections (UDEL). This budget does
not include funding for these elections. In
the event such an election is called, a budget
amendment requiring Board action would be
required and the County would be
reimbursed by the entity requesting the
election.
This budget is recommended at $556,087,
which is an increase of $25,818 (4.9%)
compared to FY 2014-15. The General
Fund provides 58.6% of the financing for
the Clerk-Recorder’s Department and is
decreased in the Recorder budget unit by
$1,092 (3.8%) compared to FY 2014-15.
The recommended budget maintains one
frozen and unfunded Deputy Clerk-Recorder
position, which was defunded in
FY 2011-12. The County Clerk-Recorder
position allocation is recommended to be
reduced in this budget unit by 0.05 FTE,
totaling 0.20 FTE, and reallocated to the
Clerk of the Board budget unit (1-105). The
Supervising Deputy Clerk-Recorder position
allocation is recommended to be reduced by
0.10 FTE, totaling 0.60 FTE, and reallocated
to the County Clerk budget unit (2-710).
The Deputy Clerk Recorder III position
allocation is recommended to be reduced by
0.50 FTE, totaling 3.0 FTE, and reallocated
to the County Clerk budget unit (2-710).
It is recommended that a special revenue
fund to be used for funding electronic
recording of documents be established. The
E-Recording Fund (0-230), per Government
Code §27397, authorizes the Recorder to
collect $1.00 per recorded document for the
implementation of an Electronic Recording
Delivery System. Participation in the
program will enable the County to improve
and modernize its systems of recording and
handling Real Property instruments by
permitting the electronic delivery, recording,
and return of specified instruments. The fee
collected will cover the cost of the County
system and maintenance.
The Board of Supervisor’s authorized this
fee as part of the County-wide Fee Update
conducted in March 2015. The appropriate
budget schedules for Fund 0-230 have been
included in the Recommended Budget. For
FY 2015-16, the recommended budget for
Fund 0-230 is $16,800, which is to be placed
into fund balance until such time the funds
can be used to fund an Electronic Recording
Delivery System.
This budget is recommended at $253,461,
which is an increase of $40,315 (18.9%) compared to FY 2014-15. The General
Fund provides 58.6% of the financing for
the Clerk-Recorder’s Department and is
increased in the County Clerk budget unit by
$15,265 (15.0%) compared to FY 2014-15.
The Supervising Deputy Clerk-Recorder
position allocation is recommended to be
increased in this budget unit by 0.10 FTE,
totaling 0.40 FTE, and reduced in the
Recorder budget unit (2-706). The Deputy
Clerk Recorder III position allocation is
recommended to be increased by 0.50 FTE,
totaling 2.0 FTE, and reduced in the Recorder
budget unit (2-706).
This budget is recommended at $20,240,
which is an increase of $240 (1.2%)
compared to FY 2014-15. The General
Fund does not provide any financing for this
budget unit.
An 8% Administration fee, allowed per
Welfare and Institutions Code Section
18305, will be collected to cover the County
cost to administer this program. This fee
revenue is shown as a negative
unreimbursed cost in this budget unit.
The budget is recommended at $1,097,941.
The General Fund provides 99.6% of the
financing for this budget unit, and is
increased by $2,026 (0.2%) compared to
FY 2014-15. A portion of the costs for this
budget unit are recouped from the Local
Agency Formation Commission for staff
support, and through the annual A-87 Cost
Plan.
The County Administrative Office assumed
oversight responsibility for the Human
Resources and Emergency Services
functions of the County in FY 2014-15. As
is discussed in the Human Resources
budget, it had been anticipated that a lowerlevel
Human Resources manager position
would be added back to the budget once
County revenues increased sufficiently.
However, due to continued budget
constraints and other needs within the
County, it is recommended that no position
be added back to this budget unit in this
fiscal year. Therefore, it is recommended
that the Human Resources function of the
County remain assigned to the County
Administrative Office for FY 2015-16 with
no additional staff within the Human
Resources Department to augment
the related functions. The County
Administrative Office will also continue to
oversee the Emergency Services budget unit
in FY 2015-16, including oversight of the
inter-related functions of Risk Management
and Emergency Services. The
Recommended Budget and Organization
Chart reflect these assignments.
The budget continues to maintain the regular
Senior Analyst position as vacant and
unfunded. This position was first left vacant
and unfunded in FY 2010-11.
The recommended budget includes a rebudget
of $30,000 for assistance with the
implementation of the Budget module,
which has been deferred for over four years
pending completion of the Personnel and
Payroll modules. It is anticipated that a
budget module will be addressed in
FY 2015-16, with primary funding provided
through the County Administrative Office.
There are no other significant changes
recommended for the County Administrative
Office budget.
This budget is recommended at $687,528.
The General Fund provides approximately
94.2% of the financing for this budget unit
and is decreased $55,580 (7.9%) compared to
FY 2014-15.
Audit Fees are recommended at $85,000 for
annual Independent Audit costs. This will be
the second year of a three-year contract.
The Professional and Special Service – Legal
line item is recommended at $110,000. The
recommended budget includes $100,000 for
one-time outside legal services related to
anticipated, pending, and/or existing litigation
against the County. Funding will only be used
if pending or existing litigation requires the
use of outside services. It is recommended
that this one-time cost be offset with one-time
monies through a cancellation of Obligated
Fund Balance in the General Revenues budget
unit (1-209). As in prior years, $10,000 is
recommended to cover residual legal issues
related to the Golden State Water Company
litigation.
The Professional and Specialized Services
account is recommended at $140,000, and
includes $10,000 for the Management
Training program along with other general
contract services currently in place or which
may be required during the year.
The Contribution to Other Agencies account
continues to reflect the County’s contribution
to the Area 4 Agency on Aging (pursuant to a
current Joint Powers Agreement).
The Contribution to Other Agencies account
also reflects the $52,000 annual contribution
to the Yuba Sutter Economic Development
Corporation, which was moved to the NDE
budget unit from the Subsidy Request budget
unit (7-202) in FY 2013-14.
Intrafund Transfers include a negative $5,000
(essentially a revenue) in Intrafund
Rents/Leases related to the Farm Advisor’s
building lease. This account is budgeted each
year.

There are no recommended costs in this
budget unit for FY 2015-16, as no filled
positions are recommended for elimination.
The estimate for the General Revenue
category (including Intrafund revenue) is
$36,535,466, which is an increase of
$3,748,977 (11.4%) compared to the
FY 2014-15 Adopted Budget.
The increase is primarily due to increases in
two primary sources of General Fund revenue:
(1) an increase in the amount of (A-87) Cost
Plan Overhead reimbursement revenue that
the General Fund receives from non-General
Fund departments (also referred to as
subvented funds) and agencies; and (2) an
increase in estimated Property Tax related
revenues.
The County's three major General Revenues
have traditionally been property tax, sales tax,
and motor vehicle in-lieu payments from the
State. However, significant changes occurred
in FY 2004-05 regarding how two of these
major revenue streams, sales tax and motor
vehicle in-lieu (MVIL) payments, are received
from the State.
The voter approved Proposition 57 (The
Economic Recovery Bond Act, 2004),
implemented a set of transactions, also known
as the “Triple Flip,” whereby a share of
revenues that had previously appeared under
the Sales and Use Taxes account are now
shown in the related In-Lieu Local Sales and
Use Tax account. The amount that each
county receives for In-Lieu Local Sales and
Use Tax is provided each year by the State
Controller’s Office. This “temporary” shift of
revenues by the State was to last until all
revenue bonds issued by the State, pursuant to
Proposition 57, were paid off. FY 2014-15
should mark the end of the Triple Flip. It is
anticipated that the bonds will be paid off in
July 2015 and, according to law, the full 1
percent Bradley-Burns local rate will return on
January 1, 2016. Transitioning to the full 1
percent rate and payment schedule will
continue, with payments on “true-up” amounts
expected through 2016.
California counties are also anticipating the
receipt of payment from the State on pre-2004
mandate reimbursements. The Governor
committed to reimbursing counties for a
portion of these pre-2004 mandate costs in
FY 2014-15; Sutter County received $102,597
toward repayment of General Fund costs
already incurred in prior years, plus $154,202
that reimbursed the Mental Health fund. The
Governor’s Budget for FY 2015-16 discusses
repayment of the balance due to counties;
however, this amount is technically included
in the current year (FY 2014-15) budget due to
trigger language that promised repayment
should State revenues exceed projections,
which they have. Payments are anticipated to
go out in two installments -- one in June and
one in August. While the Governor has
included “intent language” in an attempt to
guide how counties purpose these
reimbursements, it should be kept in mind that
it is unconstitutional to require that these
mandate reimbursements be spent in any
particular manner (Article XIII B, Section 6 of
the State’s Constitution). These monies are
due to counties as a reimbursement for
services already provided and paid for. In
Sutter County, these funds are typically returned to the General Fund to repay that
fund for monies already contributed to those
departments providing the mandated services.
Mental Health reimbursement funds are
returned to the Mental Health fund.
Prior to 2004, a primary source of revenue for
California counties was the motor vehicle inlieu.
Due to the voter approved Proposition
1A (Protection of Local Government
Revenues Act of November 2004), the State
now receives the motor vehicle in-lieu
revenues and have “swapped” that revenue for
property tax. That revenue is budgeted in the
Property Tax In-Lieu – Vehicle License Fee
account. The intent of Prop 1A was to protect
revenues collected by local governments
(cities, counties, and special districts) from
being transferred to the California state
government for statewide use. This was a
permanent change to the County-State
relationship regarding these revenues, and the
County will continue to receive Property Tax
revenues in lieu of MVIL. Property Tax In-
Lieu - Vehicle License Fee revenues are
calculated each year by a formula determined
by the State Controller’s Office. It should be
noted that these In-Lieu Property Tax
revenues are not related to, nor should they in
any way impact, the amount received in the
Property Tax – Secured account.
For FY 2015-16, property tax revenues
(including secured, unsecured, and property
tax in lieu of Motor Vehicle License Fees) are
projected to be approximately $22.6 million.
This represents a combined increase of
$1,001,000, or 4.6%, from the FY 2014-15
Adopted Budget. Estimates for property tax
and related revenues have been developed
based on an evaluation of estimates and
projections received from the Auditor-
Controller’s Office and developed by the
County Administrative Office. While it
appears that revenues are increasing, estimates
for improvements in property tax revenues
remain comparatively conservative. The
County Administrative Officer and the
Assessor estimate that secured property tax
revenue will increase by 2% over FY 2014-15
actual receipts based on recent market activity.
The Auditor-Controller’s Office has provided
the County Administrative Office with
estimates indicating that current supplemental
property tax revenue, current unsecured
property tax revenue, and other related
revenues will increase for FY 2015-16.
However, the recommended revenue amounts
represent a slight reduction from those
estimates based on recent and historic activity
and in order to maintain the conservative
nature of the County’s budgeting approach.
The budget for sales and use tax revenue,
including in-lieu revenue, is recommended at
$3.2 million. Sales tax based revenues
declined substantially in FY 2008-09 and
FY 2009-10; however, the decline in sales tax
revenues appears to have leveled off starting
with FY 2011-12. The County Administrative
Office is projecting that revenue from Sales
and Use Tax currently shows no sign of
increasing in Sutter County, and is budgeted
to remain the same for FY 2015-16. Revenue
for In-Lieu Local Sales and Use Tax is
budgeted at $100,000 higher than what was
included in the FY 2014-15 Adopted Budget.
The County receives Franchise Fee revenue
from three sources: PG&E, Recology Yuba-
Sutter, and Comcast, with the majority of the
fee revenue coming from PG&E. Because the
PG&E franchise fee is tied to electric and gas
use, this revenue source fluctuates from year
to year. However, overall, Franchise Fee
revenue from PG&E has gradually declined
over the past three years. Total franchise fee
revenue is budgeted at $1.3 million, an increase of $100,000 as compared to
FY 2014-15.
Revenue from Interest earned on monies held
by the General Fund in the pooled treasury has
decreased substantially over the past five
years. This decrease is primarily due to the
combination of a decrease in the general fund
balances held in the pooled treasury and a
general decrease in the overall pooled treasury
interest rate. Revenue from Interest is
budgeted at $50,000 less than the FY 2014-15
Adopted Budget.
The estimated available Fund Balance from
FY 2014-15 is $3.1 million. This represents
carry-forward monies generated from ongoing
County operations which can be, and
need to be, used to fund on-going County
expenditures. This represents a reduction of
approximately $400,000 fromthe amount that
was budgeted to be available in the
FY 2014-15 Recommended Budget.
It should be noted that the actual estimated
available Fund Balance will not be known
until the financial books of the County are
closed by the Auditor-Controller, typically in
October of each year, and it is likely that the
actual fund balance will differ from what is
included in this recommendation. At this
time, it is anticipated that any change in Fund
Balance available that results from the closing
of the County books at year-end will be
adjusted to the Increases in Obligated Fund
Balance account, to be placed in Obligated
Fund Balance Designated for Capital Projects
in the final Adopted Budget.
This budget is recommended at $263,558,
which is a decrease of $87,581 (24.9%)
compared to FY 2014-15. This budget unit is
within the Public Safety fund; however, it is
considered to be funded primarily by the
General Fund, which provides 26.8% of the
financing for this budget unit. This is a
decrease of $25,829 (26.7%) compared to
FY 2014-15.
For FY 2015-16, the division is now staffed
by an Emergency Operations and Loss
Prevention Manager position allocated at
0.7 FTE in this budget unit and 0.3 FTE in the
Liability Insurance ISF budget unit (4-590).
The Public Information Officer position
allocation is recommended to remain at
0.2 FTE in this budget unit.
The remaining thirty percent (0.3 FTE) of the
Emergency Operations and Loss Prevention
Manager’s 1.0 FTE allocation for FY 2015-16
will be dedicated to managing identified
countywide safety efforts, which overlap with
countywide emergency management and
communication duties. The County is eligible
for reimbursement for these duties, and the
associated revenue is reflected in the Refund
account within the Liability Insurance ISF
budget unit.

The recommended Appropriation for
Contingency is $550,000. This is the same
as FY 2014-15.
This budget is recommended at $779,250,
which is a reduction of $15,651 (2%)
compared to FY 2014-15. A portion of the
costs for this budget unit are recouped from
outside and subvented funds through the
annual (A-87) Cost Plan.
It is recommended that one vacant Human
Resource Analyst I position be eliminated;
this position is funded 75% in the Human
Resources budget unit (1-401) and 25% in
the Workers’ Compensation budget unit
(4-591). It is recommended that one
Accounting Technician I position be added
in its place; funded 75% in the Human
Resources budget unit and 25% in the
Workers Compensation budget unit.
This recommended budget reflects the
continued elimination of the Human
Resources Director position. The Human
Resources function of the County was
reassigned to the County Administrative
Office for FY 2014-15. It had been
anticipated that a lower-level Human
Resources manager position would be added
back to the budget once County revenues
increased sufficiently. However, due to
continued budget constraints and other
needs within the County, it is recommended
that no position be added back to this budget
unit in this fiscal year. The Director position
had historically been included in both the
Human Resources (1-401) budget unit (80%)
and the Workers’ Compensation (4-591)
budget unit (20%). There is no
recommendation to allocate County
Administrative staff to the Human
Resources budget unit. However, 10% of
the County Administrative Officer position
has been included in the Workers’
Compensation budget unit. The
organizational structure of the department will continue to be evaluated during
FY 2015-16.
It is recommended that the Extra Help
budget remain defunded for FY 2015-16.
The Department has been closed to the
public during the noon hour (from 12:30
p.m. to 1:30 p.m.) due to the loss of extrahelp
front desk assistance in FY 2012-13.
The Department is reducing its Professional
and Specialized Services expenses by
$25,000. This amount reflects the
elimination of contract labor negotiator
expenses for FY 2015-16. No contract
negotiations will take place in FY 2015-16,
as all represented County employee groups
recently entered into two-year contracts.
The Department has experienced a
continued need for outside investigative
services related to employee relations issues.
The Department anticipates that this trend
will continue, and that those departments for
whom the investigations are being
conducted be required to fund the cost of the
outside investigator.
This budget is recommended at $77,395
(when Intrafund revenue is included). This
results in an increase of $21,051 (37.4%)
over FY 2014-15.
There are no other changes recommended in
this budget unit. Because this budget unit
reflects only the cost of insurance premiums
which are provided to the County by the
carrier, there is no practical ability for the
County to affect budget reductions in this
budget unit in the short-term.
This budget is recommended at $517,023.
The FY 2015-16 General Fund cost for this
budget unit is $313,170, or 60.6% of the
total budget. The General Fund’s cost for
this budget unit has decreased by $7,073
(2.2%) as compared to FY 2014-15.
It is recommended that one vacant Animal
Control Officer II position and one vacant
Animal Control Officer I position be
eliminated in FY 2015-16.
Yuba City provides Workers’ Compensation
benefits for all employees including the
employees contracted from Sutter County. However, because Workers’ Compensation
costs are allocated to all Sutter County
departments utilizing a formula that includes
a 10-year experience factor, there is a
residual cost for the coverage provided in
prior years by Sutter County while it acted
as lead agency. This residual cost ($134,549
for FY 2015-16) will be borne by Sutter
County alone and is reflected in this
recommended budget. This residual amount
should decrease each year for 10 years and
will eventually reach zero.
This budget consists of the following
primary expenses and related revenues.
 Contribution to Other Agencies,
recommended at $208,045, reflecting
Sutter County’s 22% share of the SASA
operating budget. Sutter County’s share
of cost for FY 2015-16 is based on
population, and has been reduced from
25% in prior years.
 The residual Intrafund Overhead (A-87)
charge of $31,634, not shared by the
SASA jurisdictions, reflects an
adjustment to credit costs paid by Sutter
County in the prior year. This item was
removed from the shared SASA budget
in FY 2011-12 and will eventually be
reduced to zero.
 The Yuba City Animal Control revenue
line item, $203,853, which reflects the
actual cost of employees contracted to
Yuba City.
The General Fund cost for this budget unit
will reduce each year to reflect the reduction
of residual costs and any changes that may
occur to the agreement for employee
services with the City of Yuba City. At
some time in the future, this budget unit will
reflect only Sutter County’s proportionate
share of the approved SASA operating
budget.
This budget is recommended at $723,132.
The County’s Liability self-insurance was
transitioned to Trindel during FY 2014-15
and, therefore, budget adjustments were
approved mid-year in order for Trindel to
assume responsibility for liability funds.
The Liability Insurance budget unit operates
as an ISF and must balance revenues to
expenditures within the fund.
Recommended budget increases result in a
$124,024 (22%) increase in the Interfund
Liability Insurance ISF premium charges to
County Departments as compared to the
mid-year adjusted charges for FY 2014-15.
The amount budgeted in the Interfund
Liability Insurance ISF line item reflects the
total charges made to County departments
for liability insurance premiums, management of the liability fund, and loss
prevention efforts. Therefore, the increase
in this account equals the amount that has
been increased in County department
budgets for FY 2015-16.
This budget is recommended at $2,640,693,
which is an increase of $276,010 (11.7%)
compared to FY 2014-15.
It is recommended that one vacant Human
Resource Analyst I position be eliminated,
and that one Accounting Technician position
be added in its place. The position is funded
75% in the Human Resources budget unit
(1-401) and 25% in the Workers’
Compensation budget unit (4-591). It is
also recommended that 20% of the Risk
Manager position be transferred to the
Workers’ Compensation budget unit (4-591)
to reflect management of that fund and the
oversight of the County’s loss prevention
efforts. These staffing costs were previously
recorded through an Interfund transfer
(Interfund Administration – Misc.
Departments).
Because the net costs of this fund are
allocated to all County departments,
including General Fund departments, a
significant effort has been made to contain
costs in the Workers’ Compensation Fund.
Over 80% of the cost of the County’s
Workers’ Compensation program is driven
by insurance premium costs. Initial
insurance premium estimates received from
the carrier indicate an increase over the prior
year budgeted amount, driven primarily by
escalating workers’ compensation insurance
rates from the underwriting markets.
The recommended General Fund
Contribution is $3,843,515, which is an
increase of $38,082 (1.0%) compared to
FY 2014-15. As noted, this Unreimbursed
Cost represents the County share of all
recommended budgets in the Trial Court
Fund (0-014).
The recommended General Fund
contribution is $3,843,515, which is an
increase of $38,082 (1.0%) compared to
FY 2014-15.
The recommended amount equals the
revenue that is required to meet the
Unreimbursed Costs of all the budget units
within the Trial Court Fund (0-014), which
include Sheriff’s Court Bailiffs (2-103),
Public Defender (2-106), Trial Court
Funding (2-109), Superior Court (2-112) and
Probation (2-304).
The Revenue for this budget is
recommended at $22,486,019, which is an
increase of $1,339,148 (6.3%) compared to
FY 2014-15. The recommended General
Fund contribution is $14,797,672, which is
an increase of $550,801 (3.9%) compared to
FY 2014-15.
California voters enacted Proposition 172 in
1993, which established a permanent
statewide half-cent sales tax for support of
local public safety functions. Proposition
172 funding is budgeted at nearly $7.7
million for FY 2015-16, which includes
$588,377 that was received in FY 2014-15,
but not transferred into the Public Safety
Fund. The full amount received is to be
transferred from the Public Safety
Augmentation Fund (0-282) to the Public
Safety Fund (0-015) in FY 2015-16. Annual
Proposition 172 revenue, not including the
one-time transfer, is projected to equal $7.1
million for FY 2015-16. It should be noted that the increase in Prop
172 revenue is not sufficient to match the
increase in costs in the Public Safety fund.
In FY 2015-16, the General Fund is
budgeted to contribute approximately $14.8
million in funding to the Public Safety fund
in excess of the Proposition 172 funding.
The General Fund contribution to the Public
Safety fund is recommended to increase by
$550,801.
This budget is recommended at
$14,797,672, which is an increase of
$550,801 (3.9%) compared to FY 2014-15.
The General Fund contribution to the Public
Safety Fund reflects the total of the
recommended Unreimbursed Costs of all
budgets within the Public Safety Fund.
The recommended revenue is $5,970,527.
The increase of $2,390,268 in this budget
unit, as compared to FY 2014-15, is due to
the recommended change to the method of
transferring the General Fund contribution to the Health Fund, in that costs for Jail
Medical are shown in the Health Care –
General Budget Unit rather than being
transferred directly to the Jail Medical
budget unit. Likewise, there is a similar
decrease in the County contribution to the
Jail Medical budget (4-134).
The County’s contribution to the Health
Fund is recommended at $2,868,118. This
contribution includes $674,240 to satisfy the
County’s AB 8 required match (which is
interpreted to remain intact following the
passage of AB 85); and $188,781 for the
County’s required CMSP Participation Fee,
which pursuant to Welfare and Institutions
Code Section 16809.3(d) may not be paid
with Health Realignment funds and pursuant
to Welfare and Institutions Code Section
16990(e) may not be included in
determining compliance with any other
statutory Maintenance of Effort provisions.
After these deductions, the net General Fund
contribution to the Health Fund equals
$2,005,097.
MVIL Realignment revenues are
recommended at $3,100,000, which is an
increase of $379,732 (13.9%) compared to
FY 2014-15. In March 2014, AB 85 came
into effect, which redirected how sales tax
and MVIL will be distributed, as well as
ceased the pass-through of CMSP funds.
MVIL Realignment revenues will continue
to be monitored to see how that revenue
stream may affect this budget unit
throughout the coming fiscal year.
The Realignment revenue amounts are set
each year by the State Controller’s Office.
It should be noted that these budgeted
figures are subject to change once revenue
estimate information becomes available
from the State Controller’s Office later in
the year.
This budget is recommended at $5,968,118.
The County’s contribution to the Health
Fund is recommended at $2,868,118. This
contribution includes $674,240 to satisfy the
County’s AB 8 required match (which is
interpreted to remain intact following the passage of AB 85); and $188,781 for the
County’s required CMSP Participation Fee,
which pursuant to Welfare and Institutions
Code Section 16809.3(d) may not be paid
with Health Realignment funds and pursuant
to Welfare and Institutions Code Section
16990(e) may not be included in
determining compliance with any other
statutory Maintenance of Effort provisions.
After these deductions, the net General Fund
contribution to the Health Fund equals
$2,005,097.
MVIL Realignment revenues are
recommended at $3,100,000, which is an
increase of $379,732 (13.9%) compared to
FY 2014-15. In March of 2014, AB 85
came into effect, which redirected how sales
tax and MVIL will be distributed, as well as
ceased the pass-through of CMSP funds.
MVIL Realignment revenues will continue
to be monitored to see how that revenue
stream may affect this budget unit
throughout the coming fiscal year.
A policy direction recommended for
implementation during FY 2015-16, in
preparation for the production of the
FY 2016-17 Recommended Budget, is to
change the method for transferring the
County’s AB 8 Match contribution and the
County required CMSP Participation Fee. It
is recommended that a process be
developed, in conjunction with the Auditor-
Controller’s Office and the Health
Department, to transfer these General Fund
contributions first through the Health
Realignment Trust Special Revenue Fund
(0-247) and then to the Health Fund (i.e., to
the Health Care – General budget unit
4-110). These amounts are currently
transferred from the General Fund directly
to the Health Fund. The Human Services
Director concurs with this recommendation.

The recommended revenue is $4,706,007,
which is an increase of $553,421 (13.3%)
compared to FY 2014-15. This increase is
due primarily to the unreimbursed cost
increase from the Foster Care budget unit
(5-207) in FY 2015-16.
The recommended amount for the sales tax
portion of the Social Services Realignment
Revenues (SSRR), which, by statute, is first
deposited to the Welfare/Social Services
Realignment Fund, is recommended at $1,219,917. This is an increase of $432,901
(55.0%) over FY 2014-15 and is directly
attributable to the increase in unreimbursed
cost of the budget units within the
Welfare/Social Services fund.
The recommended budget for the MVIL
portion of the SSRR is $3,037,090, which is
an increase of $120,520 (4.1%) over
FY 2014-15. The Motor Vehicle In-lieu
(MVIL) portion of the SSRR is first deposited
in the General Fund and is then transferred to
this budget unit.
In March 2014 AB-85 came into effect, which
redirected how sales tax and MVIL would be
distributed. These revenues will continue to
be monitored to see how they may affect this
budget unit throughout the coming fiscal year.
The SSRR amounts are set each year by the
State Controller’s Office. It should be noted
these budgeted figures are subject to change
once revenue estimate information becomes
available from the State Controller’s office
later in the year.
The recommended budget is $3,037,090,
which is an increase of $120,520 (3.6%) over
FY 2014-15. The Unreimbursed Cost of this
budget unit represents the County share of all
recommended budgets in the Welfare/Social
Services Fund.
In March 2014 AB-85 came into effect, which
redirected how sales tax and MVIL would be
distributed. MVIL Realignment revenueswill
continue to be monitored to see how they may
affect this budget unit throughout the coming
fiscal year.
This budget is recommended at $1,128,332
which is an increase of $12,251 (1.1%)
compared to FY 2014-15. The General
Fund provides 97.2% of the financing for
this budget unit. A portion of the costs for
this budget unit are recouped from outside
and subvented funds through the annual
(A-87) Cost Plan.
One promotion within a flexibly-staffed
position is recommended - Deputy County
Counsel I to Deputy County Counsel II
based on current job performance and the
ability to take on more duties within the
office.

This budget is recommended at $998,815,
which is an increase of $12,117 (1.2%) as
compared to FY 2014-15. The General
Fund provides 62.4% of the financing for
the Department and is increased by $14,827
(2.4%) compared to FY 2014-15.
This recommendation reflects the decision
to underfill the vacant Assistant Treasurer
Tax Collector position for one year with a
Staff Analyst. This change will give the
Treasurer-Tax Collector time throughout
FY 2015-16 to evaluate the staffing
requirements of his office.
This budget is recommended at $205,497,
which is a decrease of $13,438 (6.1%) as
compared to FY 2014-15. The General
Fund provides 71.5% of the financing for
the Department and is increased by $10,743
(7.9%) compared to FY 2014-15. This recommendation reflects the continued
decision to hold vacant and unfunded one
Treasurer-Deputy Collector position that
was initially frozen and unfunded in
FY 2009-10.
The General Fund cost for this budget unit
has increased due to the depletion of Special
Revenue Funds from the Treasurer’s ORC
Collections Fund (0-243). In prior years,
these funds were transferred into the ORC
budget unit to cover the cost of one position
in the office. For FY 2015-16, $12,000 is
budgeted to be transferred to offset a portion
of the General Fund cost of one position.
This budget is recommended at $883,255,
which is an increase of $57,665 (7.0%)
compared to FY 2014-15. The General
Fund provides 25.8% of the financing for
this budget unit and is increased by $62,678
(37.8%) when compared to FY 2014-15.
Capital Assets are recommended at $26,500
for the purchase of a replacement vehicle. The
Department has requested a hybrid vehicle to replace an aging vehicle, in the Building
Services budget unit (1-700), which is no
longer used.
The vehicle will be used by administrative
staff for:
 Traveling to purchase items in town
 Showing prospective customers
available facilities for rent
 Traveling to inspect rental facilities
after a renter has vacated the facility
 Travel in town to attend meetings
with other County departments
 Travel to Sacramento to attend
meetings and seminars
At this time, staff are utilizing personal
vehicles for the above duties. It is estimated
that Department staff travel over 5,000 miles
per year combined. Staff will track savings
related to increased fuel mileage for the
hybrid vehicle to determine if such vehicles
would be suitable for future County vehicle
purchases for other departments.
Budget Changes
This budget unit reflects Intra/Interfund
Administration Service revenues, which
represent the provision of administrative
support service to the other budget units in
this Department. The addition of Interfund
Administration-Miscellaneous Department
revenue in the amount of $342,856 reflects
the administrative services provided by this
budget unit to the Information Technology
ISF and the Fleet ISF and is increased $700
(0.2%) compared to FY 2014-15.
This budget is recommended at $266,275,
which is a decrease of $20,133 (7.0%)
compared to FY 2014-15. The General
Fund provides 89.3% of the financing for
this budget unit and is decreased $21,633
(8.3%) for FY 2015-16.
This budget is recommended at $3,461,215,
which is an increase of $25,174 (0.7%) as
compared to FY 2014-15. The General
Fund provides 86% of the financing for this
budget unit and is increased by $53,332
(1.8%) compared to FY 2014-15.
A portion of the costs for this budget unit
are recouped from outside and sub-vented
funds through the annual (A-87) Cost Plan.
The Chevron Energy Savings and
Infrastructure Upgrade Project, now
managed by Opterra Energy Services, is in
its second year, and is expected to be
completed in January 2016. Project costs
for the solar array at the Acacia Corp Yard
property are reflected in the Building
Maintenance budget unit, with an
anticipated reduction in Utilities expense.
Both costs are distributed to County
departments through the annual (A-87) Cost
Plan. The share of cost from outside
funding sources will be recouped through
the Cost Plan process.
The budget also includes a reorganization of
the staffing in the Building Maintenance
program (70). This reorganization will
allow the Division to operate more
efficiently, providing enhanced supervision
of all Building Maintenance Division
programs. The following position allocation
changes, resulting in a net reduction of
1.0 FTE, are recommended for FY 2015-16:
 Delete the vacant Building Services
Worker Lead position
 Delete the vacant Building Services
Worker - HVAC position
 Add and fund a Building Services
Supervisor position effective
September 1, 2015
 Reinstate a vacant Building Services
Worker position
Capital Assets are recommended at $35,000
for one replacement ¾-ton service bed
pickup.
Building Maintenance
Professional and Specialized Services are
recommended to include only known
recurring contract work such as elevator
maintenance, fire extinguisher maintenance,
pest control services and card access system
repairs and monitoring. No contingency
funds are budgeted for unanticipated work.
Additional funding would be requested if
additional services are required.
Maintenance of Structure & Improvements
is recommended at $75,000 to cover only
those planned maintenance projects not
budgeted in Plant Acquisition (1-801).
This budget is recommended at $16,960,
which is a decrease of $4,648 (21.5%)
compared to FY 2014-15. All funding is
provided through fines and interest.
The Special Department Expense – Fish and
Game account reflects expenses related to
programs, events, and donations such as:
 Purchase of pheasants
 Support of duck egg projects
 Yuba Sutter Fair booth
 Donations of equipment to the Game
Wardens
 Donations to support special events,
programs, and projects
The Special Department Expense – Youth
Programs account reflects expenses
specifically tied to youth educational
programs, events and donations such as:
 Youth fishing derbies
 Salmon aquarium programs
 School educational programs and
field trips
 Shady Creek Outdoor School
scholarships
This budget is recommended at $1,575,905,
which is an increase of $92,791 (6.3%)
compared to FY 2014-15. The Fleet
Management budget unit operates as an ISF
and must balance revenue to expenditure
within the fund.
This budget includes a recommendation to
defund and leave vacant one currently
vacant Heavy Equipment Mechanic
position. The vacancy was created by a
retirement during FY 2014-15. The General
Services Department has requested to leave
the position vacant during FY 2015-16 while
evaluating workload related to the remaining
three mechanic positions.
Due to the volatility in the price of fuel, it is
difficult to accurately estimate future cost.
Based on current fuel prices and reduced
fuel use across departments, the
Recommended Budget for FY 2015-16
includes $486,634 for the purchase of fuel
for the majority of County departments.
This represents a 0.9% decrease compared
to FY 2014-15. Additional funding may be
required if major prolonged upward
fluctuations in fuel prices are experienced.
The Recommended Budget includes
$93,469 in Interfund Plant Acquisition
charges for the Fleet Oil / Water Separator
project. The present vehicle washing system
does not have the capability to separate the
water from oil.
This budget is recommended at $4,711,816.
The Information Technology budget unit
operates as an ISF and must balance revenues
to expenditures within the fund. The
recommended budget results in an increase of
$760,710 (19.3%) in Interfund Information
Technology charges to County departments
compared to FY 2014-15. The Interfund
Information Technology account represents the
total of all charges made to County
departments for Information Technology
services. Therefore, the increase equals the amount that has been increased in other
County department budgets for FY 2015-16.
The Recommended Budget includes the
elimination of a vacant 0.8 FTE Computer
Operator position. This results in a savings
of $56,120.
Capital Assets are recommended at
$200,000 as follows:
 Next Generation Firewall (NGFW)
System: $80,000
This will upgrade the County's
information security infrastructure to
protect in real-time against ever
increasing and advanced cyber-attacks.
The current firewall system is
antiquated. The upgrade will allow
elimination of the current firewall and
web proxy, which are both end of life.
The system includes multiple integrated
systems/software.
 Storage Area Network (SAN) System:
$70,000
This will upgrade the capacity of the
County's current SAN system that
provides the storage for virtualized
servers. The majority of the County's
production servers and applications run
in a virtualized environment housed on
the SAN (including the financial
system). The upgrade will allow
elimination of eight storage servers and
two physical servers that are all out of
warranty, end of support, and would
otherwise need to be replaced. The
system includes multiple integrated
systems.
 Datacenter Server System: $50,000
This will replace and upgrade one-half
of the County's current server system,
which provides virtualization and data
protection functions. This system hosts
the bulk of the County's production
servers and applications. The system is
currently out of warranty and half of its
components are end of support and end
of life. The system includes multiple
integrated systems/software.
This budget is recommended at $408,969.
The recommendation includes one project
that was authorized in prior years and is
continuing in FY 2015-16, as well as three
new projects for FY 2015-16.
It is recommended that immediate
authorization be given to the Development
Services Director to continue work on the
prior year project that is being re-budgeted
and both Development Services and General
Services departments to commence work on
the new projects, without waiting for the
adoption of the final budget resolution.
Both the Development Services and General
Services Departments concur with this
recommendation.
Continuing Projects
The Development Services Director and
County Administrative Officer are
recommending that one previously
authorized project, a backup generator to be
installed a the Minimum Security jail
facilities, be re-budgeted in FY 2015-16.
This continuing project totals $176,000, and
is funded by the Criminal Justice Facilities
fund (0-262). Recommended New Projects
The above chart summarizes the three new
projects recommended for approval, and
indicates the funding source for each
project. The total of the newly requested
projects for FY 2015-16 is $232,969. Of
this, $139,500 is anticipated to be a General
Fund Cost.
This budget is recommended at $125,345,
which is a decrease of $10,986 (8.1%)
compared to FY 2014-15. The General
Fund provides 70.5% of the financing for
this budget unit and is decreased by $10,986
(11.1%) for FY 2015-16.
This budget is recommended at $27,306,
which is a decrease of $3,033 (10.0%)
compared to FY 2014-15. The General
Fund provides 73.6% of the financing for
this budget unit and is decreased by $3,633
(15.3%) for FY 2015-16.
The Recommended Budget includes
estimated rental revenues of $6,600, which
reflects actual rental revenue over the past
three years. The Community Memorial
Museum Commission is estimated to receive
$2,668, which represents half of the net
rental revenue (less rental expenses). The
remaining half of the net rental revenue is
returned to the General Fund to repay the
General Fund loan used to construct the
facility.
This budget is recommended at $215,326.
This is an increase of $103,563 (92.7%).
The General Fund does not provide funding
for this budget unit. All funding is provided
by the water / wastewater systems
maintained by the Water / Wastewater
Operator position.
The budget includes $53,600 in
Maintenance of Structures as follows:
 Step Tank Cleaning $20,000
 Green Sand Replacement $20,000
 Water Tank Cleaning $2,600
 Water Tank Repairs $4,000
 Back Wash Tank Cleaning $4,500
 Back Wash Repairs $2,500
There is $15,000 budgeted in General
Supplies to cover supplies needed for
operations including:
 Chlorine
 Pumps
 Step Tanks
 General Supplies
 Replacement of worn filters/pumps
The budget contains $24,000 in Professional
and Specialized Services to cover costs
related to operations such as:
 Step Tank Pumping $15,000
 Water Sample Testing $7,200
 Other misc. services $1,800 
This budget is recommended at $35,626,
which is an increase of $1,431 (4.2%)
compared to FY 2014-15. This budget unit
does not receive any funding from the
General Fund.
This budget is recommended at $461,364,
which is an increase of $5,174 (1.1%)
compared to FY 2014-15.
The $70,797 unreimbursed cost, which is
decreased by $1,594 (2.2%) from
FY 2014-15, represents the Health
Department’s share of the Human Services-
Administration budget. This Unreimbursed
Cost is, in concept, partially funded by the
General Fund through the General Fund’s
contribution to the Health Fund.
The Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) and
the Health Information Technology for
Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH)
Act require health care providers to have in
place privacy and security protections for
health information. These privacy and
security protections were required to be in
place in 2005-06. Part of this process
included a risk analysis to conduct an
accurate and thorough assessment of the
potential risks and vulnerabilities to the
confidentiality, integrity, and availability of
electronic protected health information.
Since it has been about ten years since this
was last accomplished the Department is
recommending that another risk analysis be
performed; $25,000 has been included in the
Professional and Specialized Services
account to accomplish this task.
This budget is recommended at $6,177,481,
with a net cost of $2,886,654. This is an
increase of $137,595 (5.0%) compared to
FY 2014-15.
The County has a required contribution of
$674,240 to satisfy the County’s AB 8
required match (which is interpreted to remain
intact following the passage of AB 85). The
County’s contribution is reflected in the Health
General budget unit (4-110) and the Health –
County Share budget unit (4-112). The
balance cost for the Health budget unit is
covered by 1991 Realignment revenue.
Revenue from the Lease Agreement with
Peach Tree Healthcare, Inc. for leasing of the
Health building and the equipment/fixtures has
increased by $14,432.
In the latter half of FY 2013-14, Colusa
County discontinued the Personal Services
Agreement which provided limited services
of the Sutter County Health Officer to serve
as County Health Officer for Colusa County
as well; decreasing revenues by $74,860.
The County had been sharing the Health
Officer position with Colusa County since
FY 2010-11, with Colusa County
responsible for 20% and Sutter County
responsible for the remaining 80%. Loss of
this contract shifts this cost to the General
Fund.
It is recommended to eliminate one vacant and
defunded Social Services Worker III position
and one vacant Licensed Vocational Nurse, in
addition it is recommended to add one Public
Health Nurse II.
Of the 54.18 FTE positions contained in the
Health Division budget, 31.14 FTE positions
are directly grant funded.
This budget is recommended at $2,667,554,
which is an increase of $53,598 (2.1%)
compared to FY 2014-15.
Costs related to the provision of health care to
individuals held at or incarcerated in the
County Jail, including administration costs,
have traditionally been funded by a
combination of 1991 Realignment funding and
General Fund contributions (prior to the State’s
implementation of 1991 Realignment, services
were funded through a combination of general
revenues and AB 8 funding). For the fiscal
years 2012-13 through 2014-15, due to a
significant decline in 1991 Realignment
revenues and other county revenue sources
(related to the Recession) and based on a
request from the Human Services Director, it
was recommended that all Jail Medical
services costs be removed from the Health
budget unit (4-103) and placed into a separate
budget unit (4-134), and that any costs not
funded by AB 109 Public Safety Realignment
funds be funded entirely by the General Fund.
Beginning again for FY 2015-16, due in part to
an increase in MVIL 1991 Realignment
funding through the recent passage of AB 85, a
relatively small portion of expense currently
shown in the Jail Medical budget unit is
recommended to be funded by 1991
Realignment funds. This budget
recommendation, in essence, funds $294,693
of Jail Medical expenses with 1991
Realignment funds, with the balance funded by
approved AB109 funds and the General Fund.
The Human Services Director does not concur
with the recommendation to use a portion of
1991 Realignment funds to cover costs in the
Jail Medical budget unit. At the time of this
writing, discussions are continuing. Should
information develop in the near future that
would necessitate a change to the current
recommendation, the new recommendation,
including appropriate documentation and
budget adjustments, will be brought to your
Board for consideration.
The total cost of Jail Medical services is costapplied
back to the Jail budget through a
separate Interfund Transfer between the Jail
budget unit (2-301) and the General Revenues
budget unit (1-209). It should be noted that
this transfer is for presentation purposes, and
does not result in any increased cost or revenue
in the overall budget.
Support & Care of Persons expense reflects
direct expenditures related to the
hospitalizations and other outside care. This
line item is recommended at $700,000, which
is the same as FY 2014-15 Adopted Budget.
During FY 2014-15 the County signed a
contract with CorrectCare-Integrated Health,
Inc. to provide claims processing services and
utilization management, which should
decrease the expenditures related to Support
and Care. These expenditures will be
monitored closely over the coming year.
This budget is recommended at $596,624, with
a net cost of $571,624, which is a decrease of
$47,487 (7.7%) compared to FY 2014-15.
The County is currently in a multi-year
contract with Bi-County Ambulance Services
for indigent medical transportation. The
annual cost for these services is $26,400.
The County share for participation in the EMS
Agency is recommended at $51,208. The
anticipated cost for participation in this joint
powers agreement is based on California State
Department of Finance projections for the
population of Sutter County. This cost is
partially offset with a transfer in from the
Emergency Medical Services Special Revenue
Fund (0-252), in the amount of $25,000. 
This budget continues to reflect the CMSP
Participation Fee of $188,781, as set by statute,
for the County to participate in the CMSP.
The budget also includes $330,235 to be
transferred to the Environmental Health budget
unit (2-725).
This budget is recommended at $280,403,
which is decreased by $445 (0.2%) compared
to FY 2014-15.
At this time, the State has not determined the
amount of its contribution to the Sutter
County CCS Program for FY 2015-16. As mentioned above, in the past, as a policy item,
the County has budgeted an amount in excess
of the county share of cost in order to meet the
potential demand for service, which can be
very volatile. The budget recommendation for
$210,368 is consistent with the Board of
Supervisors’ past policy in this area and is the
same as the prior year’s Adopted Budget.
However, the Board could opt to reduce this
budget request to the minimum county share
of cost of $154,465, to match a potential
reduced State contribution. At this time it is
not known whether the State contribution
would match the amount appropriated.
This budget is recommended at $168,902,
which is unchanged compared to FY 2014-15.
This budget is recommended at
$27,547,265, which is an increase of
$2,239,314 (8.8%) compared to
FY 2014-15.
This budget unit receives no financing from
the County General Fund. The sources of
funding for Sutter-Yuba Mental Health
Services are shown in Figure 1. Mental
Health’s funding history is shown
graphically in Figure 2. The increase in total cost is largely due to
increased personnel costs and an increased
Appropriation for Contingency.
It is recommended to add one flexibly-staffed
Mental Health Therapist I/II/III position in the
Adult Outpatient Program to be recruited at
level II, and to eliminate one vacant Mental
Health Worker II in the First Steps Program. It
is also recommended to add one flexiblystaffed
Account Clerk I/II position. It is
recommended that these actions be effective
July 1, 2015.
Additionally, it is recommended to reallocate
the following positions: Increase two
Intervention Counselors by 0.5 FTE each from
the Mental Health Services Act (MHSA)
Budget Unit (4-104); increase one Psychiatrist
by 0.1 FTE from the MHSA Budget Unit
(4-104); decrease one Program Manager –
Adult Services by 0.03 FTE to the MHSA
Budget Unit (4-104); and decrease one
Program Manager – SUDS by 0.45 FTE to the
MHSA Budget Unit (4-104). It is recommended that these actions be
effective July 1, 2015.
It remains SYMHS’ objective to keep the
Mental Health budget and the Mental Health
Services Act budget in balance and to fully
utilize all available funding in a fashion
most advantageous to our counties.
This budget is recommended at
$10,171,275, which is an increase of
$742,117 (7.9%) compared to FY 2014-15.
MHSA program expenses are funded by
revenue from the State and from the Federal
share of reimbursement for services claimed
to Medi-Cal. This budget unit receives no
financing from the General Fund. See
Figures 1 and 2 in the Mental Health (4-102)
budget narrative for information on Mental
Health funding sources and history.
It is recommended to add one Staff Analyst
position to help serve as an MHSA
Coordinator. MHSA coordinator duties
have been fragmented among a number of
Mental Health managers and an independent
contractor. The proposed position would
consolidate these responsibilities and would
be responsible for program evaluation. It is
requested that this new position be allocated
effective July 1, 2015.
Realignment of responsibilities toward the
MHSA Prevention and Early Intervention and
SUDS Prevention Programs requires the
following adjustments between Mental
Health’s two budget units. Therefore, it is
recommended to reallocate the following
positions: Decrease two Intervention
Counselors by 0.5 FTE each to be moved to
the Mental Health Budget Unit (4-102);
decrease one Psychiatrist by 0.1 FTE to the
Mental Health Budget Unit (4-102); increase
one Program Manager – Adult Services by
0.03 FTE from the Mental Health Budget Unit
(4-102); and increase one Program Manager –
SUDS by 0.45 FTE from the Mental Health
Budget Unit (4-102). 
It is requested that these position
adjustments be effective July 1, 2015.
It remains SYMHS’ objective to keep the
Mental Health budget and the Mental Health Services Act budget in balance and to fully
utilize all available funding in a fashion
most advantageous to our counties.
Accordingly, a thorough review was
conducted of positions associated with
MHSA-funded Prevention and Early
Intervention (PEI) programs. As a result,
positions are regularly reviewed and
reallocated between the two budget units.
This budget is recommended at
$22,034,359, which is an increase of
$903,428 (4.3%) compared to FY 2014-15.
The Welfare and Social Services fund, as a
whole, receives $449,000 in financing from
the General Fund in order to meet the
County’s Maintenance of Effort (MOE) for
receipt of CalWORKs and related
Realignment funding.
It is recommended that one (1.0 FTE)
Accountant I position be added, with an
effective date of July 1, 2015, to provide
assistance to the Staff Services Manager in
performing increased accounting, auditing,
and fiscal duties resulting from expanded
Welfare and Social Services programs.
During FY 2011-12, Public Safety
Realignment was implemented, which
realigned the responsibility for many
programs from the State to counties.
Because of this shift in funding, Sutter
County was mandated to establish the
County Local Revenue Fund 2011 (0-140).
For FY 2012-13, the Social Services
Realignment Fund 2011 (0-245) was
established to transfer funds from the
County Local Revenue Fund 2011 to the
operating budgets of the Welfare and Social
Services Division. The shift in funding
simply changed the flow of funding from the
State to the County without affecting the
overall amount of funding for programs.
The County Local Revenue Fund 2011 and
the Social Services Realignment Fund 2011
are discussed in greater detail in their own
budget narratives.
This budget is recommended at $280,316,
which is an increase of $45,230 (19.2%)
compared to FY 2014-15. The General
Fund provides 68.6% of the funding for this
budget unit.
The percentage and manor in which the
Mental Health budget unit (4-102) is paying
for LPS cases, through Interfund MH Admin
Conservator Services account (#46519), is
being evaluated and the Department will
bring before your Board a corrected amount
at a later date. It appears, at this time, that
an update to the payment process and
amounts will result in a decrease to the
General Fund cost in this budget unit.
This budget is recommended at $1,829,446,
which is an increase of $65,472 (3.7%)
compared to FY 2014-15. This increase
represents adjustment to FY 2014-15 which
was based on the preliminary County IHSS
MOE and the inflation factor of 3.5% based
on the final County IHSS MOE. The
inflation factor increase of 3.5% is part of
the implementation of SB 1036 which
established an MOE for each county’s IHSS
expenses. The County’s MOE is met with
Welfare and Social Services 1991
Realignment funds (0-248). Any costs over
the MOE amount are paid by the State.
The General Fund does not provide any
financing to this budget unit.
This budget is recommended at $9,840,000,
which is a decrease of $143,192 (1.4%)
compared to FY 2014-15.
The FY 2013-14 State budget passed by the
Legislature includes funding to provide a
five-percent grant increase effective March
1, 2014. AB 85 amended the Welfare and
Institutions Code Section 17600.10(a)(5)
that requires counties to establish a new
subaccount wherein funds for the fivepercent
grant increase will be deposited.
The five-percent increase will be funded
through the redirection of 1991 Realignment
general growth revenues from Social
Services and Health to a new 1991
subaccount created for this purpose.
Counties will not have a share of cost for
grant increases provided from funding in the
new subaccount, the Family Support Fund
(0-227).
Commencing FY 2014-15, Welfare and
Institutions Code Section 17601.50 requires
the State to provide additional funding to the
Family Support Fund for CalWORKs grant
increases. This is funded through the
redirection of 1991 Realignment sales tax
and sales tax growth revenues from Social
Services and Health.
Also effective FY 2013-14, the State has
started remitting SB1041 TANF child
support collections pass-through funds to the
County.
The General Fund does not provide any
financing to this budget unit. The County’s
share of cost is met with Welfare and Social
Services 1991 Realignment funds.
As in previous fiscal years, the State’s share
of TANF costs, which is realized as revenue
by the County, flows through the County
Local Revenue Fund 2011 (0-140) as
opposed to being directly received by the
Division through the Welfare and Social
Services Fund as had occurred in the past.
The County Local Revenue Fund 2011 is
discussed in greater detail in its own budget
narrative.
This budget is recommended at $5,615,700
which is an increase of $857,472 (18.0%)
compared to FY 2014-15. The General
Fund does not provide any financing to this
budget unit. The County’s share of cost is
met with Welfare and Social Services 1991
Realignment funds.
The State’s share of Foster Care costs,
which is realized as revenue by the County,
flows from the County Local Revenue Fund
2011 (0-140) through the Social Services
Realignment Fund 2011 (0-245) as opposed
to being directly received by the Division
through the Welfare and Social Services
Fund as had occurred in the past. The
County Local Revenue Fund 2011 and the
Social Services Realignment Fund 2011 are
discussed in greater detail in their own
budget narratives.
This budget is recommended at $14,800,
which is unchanged compared to
FY 2014-15. The General Fund does not
provide any financing to this budget unit.
This budget unit is 100% federally funded.
This budget is recommended at $4,986,000
which is an increase of $106,212 (2.2%)
compared to FY 2014-15. The General
Fund does not provide any financing to this
budget unit. The County’s share of cost is
met with Welfare and Social Services 1991
Realignment funds (0-248).
The State’s share of Adoption costs, which
is realized as revenue by the County, flows
from the County Local Revenue Fund 2011
(0-140) through the Social Services
Realignment Fund 2011 (0-245) as opposed
to being directly received by the Division
through the Welfare and Social Services
Fund as had occurred in the past. The
County Local Revenue Fund 2011 and the
Social Services Realignment Fund 2011 are
discussed in greater detail in their own
budget narratives.
This budget is recommended at $66,960,
which is a decrease of $768 (1.1%) compared
to FY 2014-15. The General Fund provides
89.2% of the financing for this budget unit.
This budget is recommended at $2,980,175,
which is a decrease of $10,463 (0.3%)
compared to FY 2014-15. This budget unit
does not receive any funding from the General
Fund. All funding is provided through State
and Federal sources as set forth above.
It is recommended that the previously
unfunded and vacant Chief Child Support
Attorney position be eliminated in
FY 2015-16.
It is also recommended that the vacant Child
Support Attorney III position be defunded for
FY 2015-16, and that one (1.0 FTE) Staff
Services Analyst position and one (1.0 FTE)
Child Support Specialist I position be added.
One promotion within a flexibly-staffed
position is recommended - one Legal Secretary
II to a Legal Secretary III based on current
duties and assignments.
Additional reductions in this budget unit could
jeopardize the amount of State and Federal
funding that this budget unit would receive in
the future. The Department must spend all of
the funding that is received from these sources
in order to maintain this level of funding.
This budget is recommended at $3,572,403,
which is an increase of $298,232 (9.1%)
compared to FY 2014-15. The General
Fund provides approximately 83% of the
financing for the District Attorney’s Office
and is increased by $285,895 (10.6%)
compared to FY 2014-15.
It should be noted that these funding
calculations reflect the addition of Public
Safety Augmentation Funds (Proposition
172), which are transferred into the Public
Safety fund through the Public Safety
General budget unit (2-210). California
voters enacted Proposition 172 in 1993,
which established a permanent statewide half-cent sales tax for support of local public
safety functions. Proposition 172 funding is
budgeted at nearly $7.7 million for
FY 2015-16, which includes $588,377 that
was received in FY 2014-15, but not
transferred into the Public Safety Fund. The
full amount received is to be transferred
from the Public Safety Augmentation Fund
(0-282) to the Public Safety Fund (0-015) in
FY 2015-16. Annual Proposition 172
revenue, not including the one-time transfer,
is projected to equal $7.1 million for
FY 2015-16. In FY 2015-16, the General
Fund is budgeted to contribute
approximately $14.8 million in funding to
the Public Safety fund in excess of the
Proposition 172 funding.
In FY 2014-15, the District Attorney
position was vacant for part of the year due
to the retirement of the prior District
Attorney. With the election of a new
District Attorney in November 2014, the
funding for the position has been fully
restored for FY 2015-16.
Two current Deputy District Attorney I
positions are recommended to be flexibly
promoted to the Deputy District Attorney II
level. One Deputy District Attorney II
position is recommended to be flexibly
promoted to the Deputy District Attorney III
level. These promotions are recommended
as the employees in these positions will be
assigned work commensurate with the
higher level.
In FY 2013-14, an Accountant II position
was added and the vacant Administrative
Services Officer position was deleted, based
on a review of duties. Currently, the
Accountant II position is vacant and the
financial duties are being performed by an
Extra Help Accountant II along with the
District Attorney. For FY 2015-16, the
District Attorney has requested a higher
level of administrative and financial
assistance in administering and reorganizing
programs within the Office and addressing
issues that have not been addressed over the
past several fiscal years. To fill this
increased need, it is recommended that a
Limited Term with Benefits Staff Analyst
position be added to the District Attorney’s
position allocation for two years, through
FY 2016-17. This will provide the required
higher level of administrative assistance
while also providing time for the District
Attorney to thoroughly evaluate the needs of
the Office. It is recommended that this
position be authorized to be filled effective
July 1, 2015, prior to the approval of the
final Adopted Budget.
Consideration has been given to shifting
oversight of the Victim / Witness Assistance
Program to the Probation Department.
However, any possible transfer of the
program will require further evaluation by
the District Attorney’s Office, the Probation
Department, and the County Administrative
Office to determine the effectiveness of such
a shift. Consideration of practical elements
such as space requirements and accessibility
will need to be studied.
The District Attorney’s Office has requested,
and the CCP has approved, continued funding
for a Deputy District Attorney position for pretrial
services and revocation-related duties.
This position was first created and funded by
the CCP in FY 2013-14.
The recommended budget does not include
the use of Local Anti-Drug Programs
(0-264) funds and District Attorney Asset
Forfeiture Trust (0-293) funds at this time.
These special revenue funds supplement the
District Attorney’s Office’s efforts to
investigate and prosecute crime. As of July 1, 2015, the fund balance of Fund 0-264 is
projected to be $17,000, while the fund
balance of 0-293 is projected to be $47,500.
This budget is recommended at $41,676,
which is a decrease of $896 (2.1%) compared to FY 2014-15. The General
Fund provides 100% of the financing for
this budget unit.
It should be noted that many of the
expenditures incurred by each year’s Grand
Jury are authorized in Government Code and
are not restricted by the County’s annual
budget. These expenditure items are based
on the needs of each year’s Grand Jury and
may vary from year to year. The County
ultimately has limited ability to affect or
predict expenditures.
 This budget is recommended at $6,059,069,
which is an increase of $82,358 (1.4%)
compared to FY 2014-15. The General Fund
provides approximately 43.2% of the funding
for this budget unit and is increased by
$54,678 (2.1%) compared to FY 2014-15.
In FY 2014-15, the defunding of two positions
(one vacant Supervising Probation Officer and
one vacant Deputy Probation Officer) coupled
with the elimination of an Accounting
Technician II position, was recommended in
order to reduce the overall General Fund
contribution to the Department. It is
recommended that both the Supervising
Probation Officer and Deputy Probation
Officer positions remain unfunded throughout
FY 2015-16. The organizational structure
represents a reasonable span of control for all
supervisory positions within the Department.
Specifically, the supervisor-to-staff ratio for
the Supervising Probation Officer positions as
recommended is one supervisor per 7.4
officers (1:7.4). The probation industry
standard ranges between one supervisor for
every six officers (1:6) and one supervisor for
every eight officers (1:8).
Capital Assets are recommended at $22,500
for the purchase of a replacement sedan. The
vehicle being replaced is 16 years old, has over
100,000 miles and is in poor condition. This
purchase is funded by a cancellation of funds
from the General Fund’s Designation for
Future Vehicle Replacement account
(#31209). This funding is further discussed in
the General Revenues budget unit (1-209).
This budget unit receives $71,000 in
Realignment (1991) funds, which are
transferred from the Local Health and Welfare
Trust, Social Services Fund (0-248). 
This budget is recommended at $1,000, which
is the same as FY 2014-15. This budget unit
does not receive any financing from the
General Fund as it is funded by Realignment
funds, which are transferred from the Local
Health and Welfare Trust, Social Services
Fund (0-248).
This budget is recommended at $1,570,000,
which is an increase of $142,005 (9.6%)
compared to FY 2014-15. The General
Fund provides 65.4% of the funding for this
budget unit (as explained below) and is
reduced by $77,163 (8.1%) for FY 2015-16.
It should be noted that these funding
calculations reflect the addition of Public
Safety Augmentation Funds (Proposition
172), which are transferred into the Public
Safety fund through the Public Safety
General budget unit (2-210). California
voters enacted Proposition 172 in 1993,
which established a permanent statewide
half-cent sales tax for support of local public
safety functions. Proposition 172 funding is
budgeted at nearly $7.7 million for FY 2015-16, which includes $588,377 that
was received in FY 2014-15, but not
transferred into the Public Safety Fund. The
full amount received is to be transferred
from the Public Safety Augmentation Fund
(0-282) to the Public Safety Fund (0-015) in
FY 2015-16. Annual Proposition 172
revenue, not including the one-time transfer,
is projected to equal $7.1 million for
FY 2015-16. In FY 2015-16, the General
Fund is budgeted to contribute
approximately $14.8 million in funding to
the Public Safety fund in excess of the
Proposition 172 funding.
Part of the increase in the overall Juvenile Hall
budget is due to the addition of a Juvenile Hall
Superintendent position required to oversee the
Juvenile Hall. Previously, Yuba County’s
Assistant Chief Probation Officer had been
splitting his time between his regular duties
and oversight of the Juvenile Hall.
The impact of the new Tri-County JPA will
be monitored throughout FY 2015-16 as will
the project to construct the new Tri-County
Juvenile Rehabilitation Facility. The JPA
does not establish a cost sharing agreement
for the construction of the new facility.
Each county’s share for any costs over the
amount provided for in the grant from the
BSCC will be negotiated separately and
brought to the Board of Supervisors for
approval. 
This budget is recommended at $687,016,
which is an increase of $4,404 (0.6%)
compared to FY 2014-15. The General
Fund provides 92.7% of the financing for
this budget unit and is increased by $4,404
(0.7%).
In comparing appointed felony and
misdemeanor cases for the first nine months
of FY 2013-14 with the first nine months of
FY 2014-15, there was a 32% increase in
felony violation of probation cases and a
decrease of new felony appointments by 9%.
Misdemeanor cases have decreased by
approximately 18%. The Public Defender’s
Office appears at custody arraignments
under the Probation Department’s pretrial
service program and bail reduction request.
Though the Superior Court is ordering in
some cases, as a condition of probation,
payment of a nominal fee for reimbursement
to the County of Sutter for the services of
the Public Defender’s Office, it is difficult to
predict how much revenue will be received
for FY 2015-16. The Sutter County Public
Defender’s Office has been able to collect
for services rendered to those who have
been involuntarily held at private psychiatric
centers. Based upon the first nine months of
the FY 2014-15, it is anticipated the
Department should receive reimbursement
revenues totaling $4,000 for FY 2015-16.
 This budget is recommended at $26,648,790,
which is an increase of $6,771,816 (34.1%)
compared to FY 2014-15. This increase is
primarily due to a funding change in which
1991 Realignment funds no longer pass
through the Local Health and Welfare Trust –
Mental Health Fund (0-249), but instead pass
through the Mental Health Account budget
unit (4-106) to the Mental Health Services
Department (4-102). All funding is provided
by the State through Public Safety
Realignment.
As previously stated, this fund is designed to
be a “pass-through” budget where, upon
deposit, funds will immediately be transferred
out to the appropriate operating budget or
special revenue fund, as budgeted. Funds
budgeted to be used completely each fiscal
year will pass through to an operating budget,
while funds not used completely in a single
fiscal year will pass-through to a special
revenue fund, such that any unused funds will
remain separate across budget years. This
prevents fund balances from becoming comingled
and will allow each department
responsible for these realigned funds to
accurately and more easily track the
expenditure and fund balance of individual
revenue streams.
This budget is recommended at $2,880,579,
which is an increase of $120,415 (4.4%)
compared to FY 2014-15. The General
Fund provides approximately 53% of the
financing for the Sheriff’s Department and is
increased in the Communications budget by
$123,500 (4.8%) compared to FY 2014-15.
It should be noted that these funding
calculations reflect the addition of Public
Safety Augmentation Funds (Proposition
172), which are transferred into the Public
Safety fund through the Public Safety
General budget unit (2-210). California
voters enacted Proposition 172 in 1993,
which established a permanent statewide
half-cent sales tax for support of local public
safety functions. Proposition 172 funding is
budgeted at nearly $7.7 million for
FY 2015-16, which includes $588,377 that
was received in FY 2014-15, but not
transferred into the Public Safety Fund. The
full amount received is to be transferred
from the Public Safety Augmentation Fund
(0-282) to the Public Safety Fund (0-015) in
FY 2015-16. Annual Proposition 172
revenue, not including the one-time transfer,
is projected to equal $7.1 million for
FY 2015-16. In FY 2015-16, the General
Fund is budgeted to contribute
approximately $14.8 million in funding to
the Public Safety fund in excess of the
Proposition 172 funding.
The increased cost in the Overtime line item
during FY 2014-15 is primarily related to a
previously negotiated Law Enforcement
Unit Memorandum of Understanding
(MOU). The MOU provided for a bank of
holiday hours to be established in lieu of
Law Unit employees earning overtime when
a holiday was worked. The holiday bank
hours may be cashed out if they are not
used. For FY 2015-16, it is recommended
that these expenses be paid from the Other
Pay line item to differentiate between
holiday cash outs and overtime costs.
The Sheriff’s Office requested replacement
of three radios in the Communications
Center at a cost of $522,501. The
manufacturer is scheduled to stop support of
the current system during calendar year
2018. This cost is not included in the
Recommended Budget due to consideration
of alternative options. However, the County
Administrative Office recognizes the critical
nature of this request and, barring the
utilization of alternative solutions, will assist the Sheriff’s Office in seeking funding for
new radios to become operational before the
2018 deadline.
The Recommended Budget includes the
continued use of Sheriff’s Assessment Fee
Funds (0-225) to fund a Sheriff’s Legal
Specialist position. These funds were first
used for this purpose in FY 2011-12. Fund
0-225 is projected to have a $0 balance as of
July 1, 2015, with revenue of $15,000 in FY
2015-16. Therefore, $15,000 is
recommended to be transferred to the
Communications budget unit to offset the
cost of this position. The remaining cost of
the position, $45,458, is recommended to be
funded by the General Fund for FY 2015-16.
For the fifth consecutive year, it is
recommended to leave three positions
vacant and unfunded in the Communications
budget. These positions are a Criminal
Records Technician, a Public Safety
Dispatcher and a Supervising Public Safety
Dispatcher.
This budget is recommended at $609,388,
which is an increase of $21,492 (3.7%)
compared to FY 2014-15. The General Fund
does not provide any financing for this budget
unit as it is 100% funded by Realignment
revenues.
Trial court security was a component of Public
Safety Realignment in FY 2011-12. Therefore,
funding is first deposited into the County Local
Revenue Fund 2011 (0-140) in the Trial Court
Security (2-105) budget unit before it is
transferred into this operating budget. The
County Local Revenue Fund 2011 is discussed

This budget is recommended at $6,723,195,
which is an increase of $352,933 (5.5%)
compared to FY 2014-15. The General
Fund provides approximately 53% of the
financing for the Sheriff’s Department and is
increased in the Sheriff-Coroner budget by
$385,898 (6.7%) compared to FY 2014-15.
It should be noted that these funding
calculations reflect the addition of Public
Safety Augmentation Funds (Proposition
172), which are transferred into the Public
Safety fund through the Public Safety
General budget unit (2-210). California
voters enacted Proposition 172 in 1993,
which established a permanent statewide
half-cent sales tax for support of local public
safety functions. Proposition 172 funding is
budgeted at nearly $7.7 million for
FY 2015-16, which includes $588,377 that
was received in FY 2014-15, but not
transferred into the Public Safety Fund. The
full amount received is to be transferred
from the Public Safety Augmentation Fund
(0-282) to the Public Safety Fund (0-015) in
FY 2015-16. Annual Proposition 172
revenue, not including the one-time transfer,
is projected to equal $7.1 million for
FY 2015-16. In FY 2015-16, the General
Fund is budgeted to contribute
approximately $14.8 million in funding to
the Public Safety fund in excess of the
Proposition 172 funding.
For FY 2015-16, it is recommended that
current staffing levels in the Sheriff-Coroner
budget unit be maintained. Since
FY 2008-09, the average number of filled
Deputy Sheriff positions in the Sheriff-
Coroner budget unit has been 29. The current
recommendation provides for 29 filled
Deputy Sheriff positions for FY 2015-16.
Capital Assets are recommended at $228,000
for the purchase of four (4) replacement
patrol vehicles. Five patrol vehicles were
replaced in FY 2013-14, while three were
replaced during FY 2014-15.
COPS funds are not currently budgeted in the
FY 2015-16 Recommended Budget. The
Sheriff has not yet determined how these
funds will be used. Once that determination is made, the Sheriff will present his
recommendations to the Board of Supervisors
along with a recommendation to amend the
budget. COPS funds may not be used to
supplant current County public safety
funding; therefore, do not reduce the General
Fund contribution to the Public Safety Fund.
It is anticipated the Sheriff-Coroner will have
approximately $300,000 in COPS front line
law enforcement funding available for use by
the end of FY 2015-16 with an additional
$100,000 in COPS funding available for use
specifically in the Jail.
 This budget is recommended at $133,470, an
increase of $744 (0.6%) over FY 2014-15.
This small increase is offset by revenue from
the other participating agencies and CalMMET
revenue transferred in from the County Local
Revenue Fund 2011 (0-140). This results in no
unreimbursed cost for the General Fund. The
County Local Revenue Fund 2011 is discussed
in greater detail in its own budget narrative.
The NET 5 Secretary - Law position is
allocated in this budget unit. Sutter County
pays one third of the cost of the position’s
salary and benefits.

Fund is budgeted to contribute approximately
$14.8 million in funding to the Public Safety
fund in excess of the Proposition 172
funding.
It is estimated that approximately 60% of the
total expenditures for the Boat Patrol budget
unit will be reimbursed by the State
Department of Boating and Waterways in
FY 2014-15. These reimbursements are
derived from boat registration fees. The
County contributes collected boat taxes and
pays for expenditures not subject to State
reimbursement. The Department of Boating
and Waterways’ allocation to Sutter County
is likely to remain at $214,800 as it has for
the past several years. Thus, any expenditure
increases beyond the allocation and collected
boat taxes become a County General Fund
cost.
This budget is recommended at $1,365,933,
which is an increase of $128,215 (10.4%)
compared to FY 2014-15. The General Fund
provides approximately 53% of the financing
for the Sheriff’s Department and is increased
in the Sheriff – Live Oak budget by $45,509
(23.6%) compared to FY 2014-15. The majority of costs for patrolling the area
in and around the City of Live Oak are
shared 80% by the City and 20% by the
County. However, the salary and benefits of
a Lieutenant position, all dog handlingrelated
items, and new patrol vehicles are
costs covered in full by the City.
The Sheriff provides some law-enforcement
services to the City of Live Oak at no charge
for which the City would have to pay if it
were to have its own police department, or if
it had a typical contract for sheriff services.
Among these services are dispatch,
detectives (for major felonies), records,
narcotics, and special enforcement detail
(SWAT). These costs are not represented in
this budget unit.
This budget is recommended at $9,583,936,
which is an increase of $400,348 (4.4%)
compared to FY 2014-15. The General
Fund provides approximately 53% of the
financing for the Sheriff’s Department and is
increased in the Jail budget by $376,394
(4.7%) compared to FY 2014-15.

Funding for two Correctional Officer
positions, which had previously been held
vacant and unfunded, is recommended to be
reinstated. This recommendation results in
an increase of $145,606 to general Salaries
and Benefits accounts. However, it is
anticipated that vvertime use can
subsequently be curtailed, resulting in a
decrease in recommended Overtime of
$119,540. It is recommended that these
positions be authorized to be filled effective
July 1, 2015, prior to the approval of the
final Adopted Budget.
Prop 47 was passed in November 2014 as an
initiated state statute. The initiative reduces
the classification of most non-serious and
nonviolent property and drug crimes from a
felony to a misdemeanor. Proposition 47 is
having an impact on county jail populations
throughout California. In Sutter County,
like many California counties, the jail
population is currently trending down;
however, this is not necessarily indicative of
long-term impacts as Prop 47 is in its early
stages of implementation.
Capital Assets are recommended at $27,588
for the purchase of one (1) replacement
convection steamer in the Jail kitchen and
one replacement (1) food delivery cart. It is
recommended that these items be funded
with a cancellation of prior year Committed
Fund Balance from the Criminal Justice
Facilities Fund (0-262). This offsetting
revenue is shown in the Interfund Transfer-
In Special Revenue account within the Jail
budget.
The Utilities account reflects an increase of
$119,046 compared to FY 2014-15 due to
the implementation schedule of the Chevron
Energy Project, and a correction to the
estimate of annual savings that will accrue
directly to the Jail. Despite the increase
compared to FY 2014-15, the budgeted
amount of $246,546 reflects savings versus
previous years’ utilities costs. The Jail’s
share of the annual financing payment for
these improvements is reflected in
Rents/Leases account.
Sutter County is in the process of expanding
the County Jail. The project will expand the
capacity of the Maximum Security facility
by 42 beds, and is feasible only due to a $9.7
million bond financing grant from the State.
The Jail Expansion Project (1-701) budget
unit was created to account for costs
incurred for the Main Jail Expansion project
and is discussed in its own narrative.
The project’s design phase should be
completed by December 2015. This will be
followed by the construction phase lasting
approximately 18 months. Only after a
construction contract has been awarded can the County begin to seek reimbursement for
eligible design costs.
This budget is recommended at $348,222,
which is an increase of $11,244 (3.3%)
compared to FY 2014-15. This fund is
estimated to generate $272,000 in revenue
during FY 2015-16. Therefore, $76,222 of
fund balance is being used to offset a portion
of the cost of this budget unit, as described
below.
The General Fund does not provide any
financing for this budget unit. This fund is
financed by revenue generated from inmate
use of public telephones and inmate
purchases from the jail commissary.
This budget is recommended at $951,000,
which is the same as FY 2014-15. The
General Fund provides 19.2% of the
financing for this budget unit and is
decreased by $8,600 (4.5%) due to a
projected revenue increase for FY 2015-16.
This budget is recommended at $518,620,
which is an increase of $6,100 (1.2%)
compared to FY 2014-15. The General
Fund provides 77.9% of the funding for this budget unit and is reduced by $12,400
(3.0%) for FY 2015-16.
