Significant Program Changes

The introduction of the Asian Citrus Psyllid (ACP) into both Fresno and Tulare Counties has changed the trapping program for this pest from a six-month seasonal program to a year-round program.

With the submittal of this budget, the Department is reclassifying one lead Agricultural/Standards Specialist Ill position to a Supervising Agricultural/Standards Specialist. There is no additional Net County Cost (NCC) for this change.

Pension Obligation Bond Third Party Paver

Recommended is a designation of $10,000,000 to address the potential disallowance of POB costs claimed to third party funding sources, such as Federal grants, for a portion of the refinanced pension obligation bonds. Principles governing Federal cost reimbursements are set out in the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-87 (A-87). OMB A-87 treats pension plan costs as fringe benefits that are allowable to be claimed, including POBs. In March of 1998, the County issued POBs in the amount of $184,910,000 to cover the Unfunded Actuarial Accrued Liability (UAAL). Due to the
State of California's economy and stagnant growth in Countywide revenues, the County issued Taxable POBs, 2002 Refunding Series. Approximately $117,000,000 of the 1998 POBs were refunded. By refunding the bonds, the County was able to reduce its annual debt service and extend its debt service schedule out 10 years, but in doing so, the County incurred an additional $77 million in debt service payments. At the time of the 2002 POB issuance, the County of Fresno was not aware of the potential for future denial of claims, as correspondence from the Federal Department of Health and Human Services, regarding issuance guidelines relative to allowable costs on refunding POB that increase the total debt service was not circulated to the County until February of 2003. To date, no Federal claims have been denied reimbursement for reasons concerning claiming POB costs. It is estimated that the potential cost of the disallowance is $50,000,000 in total and $10,000,000 for FY 2016-17. It is the County's intent to fully appeal any and all amounts disallowed through the Federal Government’s administrative appeals process. The recommended addition of $10,000,000 in FY 2016-17 would bring the total amount reserved for POB Disallowances to $28,957,503.

Quentin Hall Settlement (formerly Sheriff’s Staffing Mitigation)

Recommended is a designation of $1,000,000 to address Jail Facility safety and accessibility issues. When adopted, these designated appropriations will be budgeted in the Capital Projects Fund 0400, Jail Improvements Org 8852, and a new Budget Org.

Capital Projects

The Recommend Budget includes a designation of $5,000,000 for Capital Projects that include building improvements in Hall of Records that are needed once the Recorder’s Office moves to a new facility and Capital Projects as designated by the Board.

FY 2015-16 Designations

The FY 2015-16 Adopted Budget Designations included four designations totaling $17,200,000.

A designation in the amount of $10,000,000 was reserved to address the potential disallowances of POB costs claimed to third party funding sources, such as Federal grants, for a portion of the refinanced POBs. To date, no Federal claims have been denied reimbursement for reasons concerning claiming POB costs. As of June 30, 2016 the balance of this designation from FY

2014-	15 and FY 2015-16 i s anticipated to be $18,957,503.

A designation in the amount of $700,000 was reserved for the Sheriff-Coroner’s Vehicle Replacement Designation. As of the development of the FY 2016-17 Recommended Budget, the Designation has a balance of $1,300,000. The Sheriff-Coroner’s Office maintains a fleet of patrol vehicles to provide a law enforcement presence for the unincorporated areas of the County’s 6000 square miles. As a General Fund department, the Sheriff's Office does not charge itself “depreciation” for the replacement of Sheriff Patrol vehicles. The wear and tear and extended mileage on the patrol fleet results in repairs needed to keep many of the vehicles operational which now include engines, transmissions and other repairs that exceed the salvage value of the vehicle. As part of the annual budget process, the Sheriff reviews available funding from the Department’s Net County Cost (NCC) and any available Departmental NCC carryover that may be contributed to this designation. In budget preparation the Sheriff-Coroner will continue to review the level of success achieved in bringing the patrol fleet to a timely and orderly replacement schedule. After the Department has made the first initial replacement of all patrol vehicles (seven year schedule), the Department will transition to replacement funding from the Vehicle Replacement Designation. This is the second year of the seven year schedule.

A designation in the amount of $6,500,000 was reserved for County Budget mitigation for adjustment during the FY 2015-16 budget hearings and to mitigate potential impacts of the FY

2015-	16 State Budget or during the Fiscal Year. This funding was not used in FY 2015-16 and returns to Fund Balance.
A designation in the amount $5,950,000 was reserved in the FY 2014-15 Adopted Budget to address potential staffing needs in the Fresno County Jail related to the Quentin Hall settlement. A total of $2,509,449 of the designation was included in the FY 2015-16 Adopted Budget of the Sheriff-Coroner Org 3111 to fund Phase One (51 correctional staff) of a three-year staffing plan for additional correctional staff. A balance of $3,440,551 remained in the designation (Assigned Fund Balance) to fund the Plaintiffs' attorney's fees and other costs associated with the settlement. On December 8, 2015 the Board approved $900,000 for a Quentin Hall settlement payment of Plaintiff's attorney fees and on February 9, 2016 the Board approved $1,000,000 for facility modifications in the Sheriff's Detention Facilities leaving a FY 2015-16 balance of $1,540,551 in the designation. In FY 2016-17 a portion ($1,000,000) of the designation's remaining balance is recommended to fund the Quentin Hall settlement's required jail facility modification with the rest ($540,551) returning to Fund Balance.



Services and Supplies

Services and Supplies, recommended at $1,889,899, represent a less than 1% ($12,669) increase over the FY 2015-16 Adopted Budget due to increased PeopleSoft Financial charges and increased utility charges for the North Annex Jail Court.

Other Charges, recommended at $16,520,107, represent a less than 1% ($12,669) decrease from the FY 2015-16 Adopted Budget.

Recommended funding includes:

The County’s State Trial Court MOE obligation of $14,758,944, which includes a base Court services cost obligation of $11,222,780 and a fines and forfeitures base of $3,536,164.

Maintenance-Buildings and Grounds are recommended at $595,000, the same level as the FY 2015-16 Adopted Budget. This recommended amount is based on projected expenditures for emergency repairs and costs associated with maintaining County buildings and property leased to others. Due to the Facilities Services Internal Service Fund (ISF) being relatively new and to keep department charges at a reasonable level, reserves for emergency repairs are currently not included in the ISF. The Internal Services Department (lSD) administers these activities. 
Countywide Audit and Related Consulting Services recommended at $155,000 represents a 57% ($117,820) reduction from the FY 2015-16 Adopted Budget. The decrease is largely due to the ACTTC direct billing FY 2016-17 costs associated with Community Service Area (CSA) audits rather than funded through Org 2540 with subsequent reimbursement. Expenditures are for the annual independent audits required by various Government Codes, U.S. Government Auditing Standards, the Single Audit Act, and individual Federal/State grants. The audits are also necessary for the County's bond rating and are directly related to the cost of borrowing. Reimbursements in the amount of $14,320 are expected to be received from third party payers to offset the audit costs related to their agencies. The recommended funding also allows for other
expert consulting services that may be needed to complete financial statement disclosures. The ACTTC administers these activities.

Government Finance Officers Association (GFOA) recommended at $1,150 represents a 5% ($50) increase over the FY 2015-16 Adopted Budget. This recommended appropriation is to obtain a GFOA - Certificate of Achievement, a certification established to encourage local governments to go beyond minimum requirements when preparing Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports. Achieving the certificate enhances confidence in the reported financial position of the County. The ACTTC administers this activity.

Standard & Poor’s recommended at $25,000 represents an 9% ($2,000) increase over the FY 2015-16 Adopted Budget. The recommended appropriations are based on projected increases for costs to obtain bond ratings that are required in order to issue the County's annual TRAN. The ACTTC administers this activity.

Sales Tax Recovery is recommended at $150,000, the same level as the FY 2015-16 Adopted Budget. These appropriations fund the recovery of sales tax revenues. Contracted services include analysis to help ensure vendors properly report to the State all sales tax receipts applicable to the County. Increased sales tax revenues fully-offset the cost of the contract. The ACTTC administers these activities.

Trustee Fees are recommended at $12,000, the same level as the FY 2015-16 Adopted Budget. These appropriations are used to pay the Bank of New York for administering the 2012 LRRB, Juvenile Justice Court Facility and Offices Lease Revenue Bonds LRBs and Pension Obligation Bonds (POB).

The ACTTC administers these activities.

Actuarial Fees recommended at $15,000 represents a 400% ($12,000) increase over the FY 2015-16 Adopted Budget. These appropriations are used to fund the cost of contracted actuarial services to implement Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) 68, which changes the way the County reports their pension liability on their financial reports. The ACTTC administers these activities. 
Bond Counsel recommended at $92,000 represents a 9% ($7,300) increase over the FY 2015-16 Adopted Budget to fund services required from outside bond counsel. County Counsel does not have the expertise regarding municipal finance matters (e g. bond issuance), and investors expect to see a nationally recognized law firm on the bond documents. County Counsel administers these activities and incurs the bond counsel expenditures in County Counsel Org 0710 with subsequent reimbursement from Org 2540.

State and Federal Legislative Advocacy Services recommended at $186,816 represents a 2.6% ($4,804) increase over the FY 2015-16 Adopted Budget and are based on costs for contracted services with State ($98,008) and Federal ($88,008) Legislative Advocates.

The JPA now consists of seven members including the cities of Fowler, Kingsburg, Orange Cove, Parlier, Reedley, and Sanger, as well as the County of Fresno. Membership dues are proportionate to each member agency's population. The County Administrative Office administers these activities.

Driver Alliant Insurance Liability is recommended at $275, the same level as the FY 2015-16 Adopted Budget and is for the Retirement Board's insurance coverage. California Government Code Section 7511 requires the County to pay for premiums related to the non-recourse clause of fiduciary liability insurance for the Fresno County Employees' Retirement Association (FCERA) Board and Administrator. The Code prohibits a public retirement plan from paying this charge. The bill is received from FCERA and payment is processed by the County Administrative Office.

Council of Governments (COG) Membership Dues is recommended at $15,500, the same level as the FY 2015-16 Adopted Budget. These appropriations fund annual membership dues that are required through the COG Joint Powers Agreement (JPA). COG (a mandated State and Federal-designated Regional Transportation and Metropolitan Planning agency) currently uses the dues for State and Federal lobbying efforts that cannot be funded from the Road Fund. Participation in the JPA is necessary for the County to have a voice in regional decision-making and the programming of hundreds of millions of dollars in regional and local transportation funding.

On September 29, 2014, the Governor approved Assembly Bill (AB) 2668, which became effective July 1, 2015. AB 2668 provided an extra $200 in addition to the infant supplemental payments available to Non-Minor Dependents (NMD) parents who reside in a Supervised Independent Living Placement (SILP) and complete a Parenting Support Plan (PSP). The purpose of AB 2668 is to address the unique challenges of young parents residing in a SILP by providing adequate support and services to preserve and strengthen the family unit. Provisions in this bill require the identification of a responsible adult mentor and the creation of a PSP. The PSP serves as an avenue to identify significant supports to assist the NMD parent in developing the skills necessary to provide a safe, stable and permanent home for their child. A NMD parent in a SILP will still be eligible to receive the $411 Aid to Families with Dependent Children-Foster Care infant supplemental payment in addition to the $200 increase in payment that comes from entering into the PSP with an adult mentor.

Significant Program Changes

Effective July 1, 2012, the State implemented a Maintenance-of-Effort (MOE) for the IHSS Program. Prior to the IHSS MOE, the County share-of-cost for IHSS was determined through statutory sharing ratios, and the County was responsible for approximately 17.6% of the total cost of the IHSS program . Under the MOE, the County share-of-cost became a set amount that was equal to the actual County share-of-cost incurred by each county for FY 2011-12. The County must pay that set amount regardless of the actual IHSS program expenditures. Through the IHSS MOE, the County will not be financially impacted by any caseload increases; however, the County will also not realize any financial savings resulting from caseload decreases. Based on current statute, the IHSS MOE can be increased by the State for the following reasons: 1) County negotiated wage and/or benefits increases; and 2) an annual inflation factor of 3.5% effective July 1 of each fiscal year with the exception of years where there is ’negative growth' in 1991 Realignment funds. Based on this statute, a $987,372 increase in the MOE will be in effect July 1,2016 and is included in the Recommended Budget.

In March 2013, the State, IHSS beneficiaries, and labor organizations reached a settlement resolving major legal actions against State imposed reductions to the IHSS Program. Under the terms of the settlement, the State reduced authorized hours by 8% in FY 2013-14 and then restored 1% of the reduction in hours beginning on July 1, 2014, reducing the total hour reduction from 8% to 7% for FY 2014-15 and forward. For FY 2015-16 the State is, per the settlement, evaluating the ability to remove the 7% reduction . The January 2016 Governor's budget accounted for the continuation of the 7% reduction being removed; therefore, the removal of the 7% reduction will continue to be utilized in calculating the Department's recommended appropriations. However, as the County share-of-cost for the IHSS program is under a MOE, the total increase in costs associated with the 7% increase in hours will be offset by State and Federal revenues.
Effective February 1, 2016, the State implemented the Department of Labor (DOL) regulation to provide additional paid hours for travel time and medical accompaniment. Based on the Governor’s January 2015 estimate, 85% of the IHSS cases will be eligible for the additional three hours per month for medical accompaniment. The Department estimated an additional 41,389 hours based on the average number of cases. In addition, the DOL regulation provided each provider with two or more recipients an additional seven paid hours per week for travel time. The Department estimated an additional 76,341 hours based on the percentage of providers that had two or more recipients in FY 14-15. Both factors have been included in calculations of the Department's recommended appropriations.

Significant Program Changes

Effective July 1, 2012, the State implemented a Maintenance-of-Effort (MOE) for the IHSS program, which includes the Public Authority. Prior to the IHSS MOE, the County share-of-cost for the Public Authority was determined through statutory sharing ratios, and the County was responsible for approximately 17.6% of the total cost. Under the MOE, the County share-of-cost became a set amount that was equal to the actual County share-of-cost incurred by each County for FY 2011-12. The County must pay that set amount regardless of the actual Public Authority expenditures. Based on current statute, the IHSS MOE can be increased by the State for the following reasons: 1) County negotiated IHSS provider wage and/or benefits increases; and 2) an annual inflation factor of 3.5% effective July 1st of each fiscal year with the exception of years where there is ’negative growth' in 1991 Realignment funds.

Tax Revenue Anticipation Notes (TRAN) (Account 7867)

For the first time in 37 years, the Board of Supervisors did not authorize a short-term borrowing program through a TRAN issuance in FY 2015-16. A TRAN issuance enables the County to maintain a positive cash flow until anticipated taxes and revenues are received throughout the fiscal year.

If needed for FY 2016-17, the recommended funding of $2,700,000 for FY 2016-17 is based on an assumed $90,000,000 debt issuance at a 3% interest rate. This represents the same level of funding as recommended for FY 2015-16. If the final debt issuance amount and interest rate for FY 2016-17 result in a debt requirement that is significantly less than what is budgeted, any savings would be available for re-appropriation, as approved by the Board.

Upon receipt, TRAN proceeds are deposited into an interest bearing account. Funding for the interest payment is transferred from the Interest and Miscellaneous Expenditures budget Org 2540, where it is budgeted as net County cost.

In March 1998, the County issued $184,910,000 of taxable POB with a 1 0-year amortization to fund the Unfunded Actuarial Accrued Liability (UAAL) of the Fresno County Employee’s Retirement Association. In March 2002 these bonds were partially refunded in order to extend the debt servicing of the bonds to an 18-year amortization period.

Tobacco Securitization Bonds
In August of 1998 a Master Settlement Agreement (MSA) occurred to resolve cigarette smoking-related litigation between the settling states and the Participating Manufacturers (PMs) and released the PMs from past and present smoking-related claims in exchange for certain payments to be made to states. Fresno County was allocated a share of the Tobacco Settlement Revenues (TSRs) by the State of California through a Memorandum of Understanding. The Fresno County Tobacco Funding Corporation (Corporation) was incorporated June 13, 2002. It is a nonprofit public benefit organization as defined by Internal Revenue Code Section 501 (c)(3). The Corporation is a member of the California County Tobacco Securitization Agency (Agency), a joint powers agency created in November 2000 by the County of Fresno (County) and eight other California Counties.

2002 Bond Issuance

One June 18, 2002, the Board of Supervisors adopted Resolution No. 02-329 which approved the sale of certain County TSRs. Under the terms of the sales agreement, the County realized
through bond proceeds the present value of 75% of its TSRs continued to receive 25% of its annual TSRs. On July 25, 2002, the County through the Corporation issued $92,955,000 in Tobacco Settlement Asset Backed Bonds in part to finance the costs of construction and development of the County's Juvenile Justice Campus. The 2002 bond proceeds were only used to fund the costs of the Juvenile Justice Campus. The remaining appropriations have time restrictions.

2006 Bond Issuance

On February 2, 2006, the Board provided direction to staff to proceed with the analysis of issuing additional tobacco bonds. The analysis found that a subordinate bond offering could result in between $31 million to $42 million in net proceeds to the County. The Board determined that given the considerable risk associated with the receipt of the TSRs over the course of the next years that the associated sale of these future TSRs by the County represented a good opportunity. The 2006 Bonds were structured to shift greatest amount of risk to the investors. The bonds were sold as subordinate lien Capital Appreciation Bonds (CABs). CABs are debt instruments where interest is accumulated and at maturity the principal and interest are paid in one lump sum. Further the CABs were wrapped around the existing 2002 Tobacco Bonds, meaning the 2006 Bonds would be paid only after all of the 2002 Bonds are paid in full. On April 12, 2006 the County received $37,794,190 in bond proceeds which was placed in an endowment fund to be used for capital expenditures.

As of April 15, 2016 the County had $5,276,075 in uncommitted Tobacco Bond proceeds available for qualified capital projects from both issuances.

Significant Program Changes

On June 24, 2015, Senate Bill (SB) 79 passed making changes to the 1991 realignment statutes. Among the changes that impacted Fresno County was the removal of the additional conditions of depositing County general purpose revenues for every Vehicle License Fee (VLF) dollar deposited in the County General Fund (Discretionary Fund). Beginning with FY 2015-16, VLF funds received are to be directly deposited to the Health and Welfare Special Revenue Fund 0135 Org 5243. SB 79 also changed the County's requirement to file reports to the State Controller's Office annually instead of quarterly. The County's MOE for Mental Health and Public Health remain unchanged.



Significant Program Changes

Some of the increase in appropriations is reflective of several large multi-year projects that have been awarded to the County. The Division has been very successful in applying for and being awarded several projects from different funding agencies. The Division has been awarded funding for four Active Transportation Projects totaling $976,487. Also, in the Highway Bridge Program administered by the Federal Highway Administration, $48,844,000 has been secured to replace or maintain existing bridges. Because the projects are multi-year, the funds will be distributed in increments through FY 2020-21. The overall budget still reflects an allocation of Measure “C” and routine road maintenance projects that will be awarded for construction or have significant design completed in the coming fiscal years.

To meet the current number of projects, it is recommended that three positions be added. The additional staff will be utilized in the Road Maintenance Division. The additional positions will bring the staffing level to 206.
