Significant Program Changes
In November of 2012, the Fresno County Sheriff’s Office and the Fresno County Probation Department were selected to be part of the National Transition from Jail to Community Initiative (TJC). Through the award, the agencies have begun a process to reverse the trend of criminal recidivism in adult correctional populations. Through the provision of evidence based planning, the jail committed to

develop jail services and programs that connect to a continuum of community services designed to enhance successful integration. This program, offset with AB 109 (2011 Realignment) public safety funding, will consist of a 72 bed pod located in the North Annex Jail. Offenders will receive services and programs aligned with evidenced based practices that are responsive to the offender’s needs. Staffing for the transition pod will include: one Correctional Sergeant, two Correctional Officers, one Social Worker, and two Deputy Probation Officer positions. Full-year funding for this program in the amount of $651,888 is included in the recommended budget.
The addition of 15 Correctional Officer positions as Phase 1 of addressing the conversion of overtime costs to full-time positions for jail staffing.
Salaries and Benefits

Salaries and Benefits, recommended at $140,912,638, represent a 4% ($5,433,049) increase over the current year adopted budget primarily due to full-year funding for positions associated with the opening of the last closed floor of the North Annex Jail, implementation of the Jail Transition Pod, and the addition of 15 Correctional Officer positions for jail staffing. Staffing is recommended for 1,035 positions.

Full-year funding for 11 Coroner positions to cover a population of approximately 948,000 over the 6,000 square miles of Fresno County 24/7, including: one Coroner-Public Administrator, one Chief Forensic Pathologist, one Forensic Pathologist, one Senior Deputy Coroner, five Deputy Coroners, one Forensic Autopsy Technician, and one Account Clerk.

Currently there are six budgeted Deputy Coroner positions which equates to an approximate ratio of 0.63 positions per 100,000 in populations. In 2012, Kern County had a ratio of 1.00 Deputy Coroner positions per 100,000 populations and Sacramento County had a ratio of .76 Deputy Coroner positions per 100,000 populations; an increase of one Deputy Coroner over the FY 2012-13 Adopted Budget.

Services and Supplies

Services and Supplies, recommended at $764,776, represent a 20% ($124,998) increase over the FY 2012-13 Adopted Budget primarily as the result of a significant increase in Facility Services and Utilities rates required to operate the new Fresno County Regional Forensic Center. Prior year budget was based on estimated rates; this change reflects actuals.
Recommended funding includes:

Account 7430, Utilities recommended at $34,241 reflect a 67% ($13,741) increase over the FY 2012-13 Adopted Budget due to the costs to operate the new Fresno County Regional Forensic Center. Prior year budget was based on estimated rates; this change reflects actual costs.

Account 7345, Facility Operation & Maintenance recommended at $119,093, reflects an 894% ($107,115) increase over the FY 2012-13 Adopted Budget that was a result of insufficient rate history for the new Coroner facility available during the FY 2012-13 budget development process.

Significant Program Changes

Two Deputy District Attorney positions assigned to the Career Criminal unit were transferred to this Org from District Attorney Grants Org 28622000 and will be funded with net County cost due to funding being eliminated from the California Emergency Management Agency, Vertical Prosecution Block Grant. This unit aggressively handles the prosecution of violent habitual criminals from filing to disposition, seeking to impose the most severe authorized sentence.

Felony workload increases since the effective date of AB 109 (October 1, 2011) – Four Deputy District Attorney positions, two Senior District Attorney Investigators, one Paralegal, and one Office Assistant positions are recommended for addition to manage the significant felony caseload increases since the implementation of AB 109 legislation. In the first year of implementation of AB 109 (October 1, 2011 through September 30, 2012), felony case filings increased 16% over the previous one-year period (October 1, 2010 through September 30, 2011) adding 1,466 felony cases to the District Attorney’s Office. For the upcoming second full-year of Realignment (October 1, 2012 through September 30, 2013) felony caseloads are projected to increase an additional 7% to a total of 23%, adding over 3,600 new felony cases in the first two years since the implementation of AB 109.

Parole realignment to local supervision means offenders who have violated the terms of their supervision are not returned to prison under the realignment scheme. Prosecutors are now handling Post-Release Community Supervision (PRCS) hearings and will handle parole revocation hearings beginning in July 2013; further increasing the workload of the District Attorney’s Office.

In November 2012, voters in California changed the “Three Strikes Law” by approving Proposition 36. The District Attorney’s Office now must appear at resentencing hearings for lifer three strike inmates petitioning for release. As of the end of April 2013, up to 77 three strike defendants could return to Fresno County for hearings and 6 have been released after resentencing by the Court. These hearings require the compilation and review of District Attorney case files and prison documents spanning multiple decades. A Deputy District Attorney and a Paralegal have been reassigned from their normal workload to full-time work on preparing for and appearing at resentencing hearings for lifer state prisoners to oppose release when appropriate. Although these resentencing hearings have substantially increased the workload, the District Attorney is not requesting additional resources to perform this function since this additional duty is of a limited duration.

Replacement Case Management System - the District Attorney’s Office is completing the analysis of responses to the RFP for replacement of its outdated STAR (Standard Tracking And Reporting) case management system. The STAR system is not sustainable leaving the District Attorney’s Office vulnerable to potential total system failure. Such a failure could impact the entire justice system in this County. The committee will complete selection in May 2013, with an anticipated Board agenda item seeking vendor approval of the agreement in August/September 2013.
Salaries and Benefits

Salaries and Benefits, recommended at $22,874,166, represent a 5% ($1,043,933) increase over the current year adopted budget primarily due to additional staffing and the associated costs.
Recommended funding includes:

The addition of eight positions: one Paralegal, four Deputy District Attorneys, two Senior District Attorney Investigators, and one Office Assistant.

The transfer of two Deputy District Attorney positions from the Grant Org 2862 due to the elimination of grant funding for the Career Criminal Prosecution program.

Account 6100, Regular Salaries reflects a 4% ($440,745) increase over the current year primarily due to increases in staffing as detailed above.

Account 6200, Extra-Help reflects an 118% ($242,937) increase over the current year adopted budget to bring it closer to actual usage.

Services and Supplies

Services and Supplies, recommended at $3,693,220, represent a 6% ($227,880) decrease from the current year primarily due to reductions in leased facilities rent, a decrease in the estimated payment for the replacement case management system, and lower Liability Insurance rates.
Recommended funding includes:

Account 7039, Mobile Communications represent a 99% ($40,852) increase over the current year based on the inclusion of lease payment costs for the replacement of radios to meet regulatory requirements effective January 1, 2013 and estimated usage for FY 2013-14.

Account 7340, Rents and Leases-Buildings represent a 22% ($97,929) decrease from the current year due to a reduction in occupied space and associated lease costs at the Multi-Agency Gang Enforcement Consortium (MAGEC) facility, as well as the completion of the tenant improvement payments for leased space at 1260 M Street.

Account 7345, Facilities Operations & Maintenance represents a 22% ($42,341) decrease from the current year based on FY 2013-14 rates.

Account 7416, Transportation & Travel County Garage represents a 15% ($36,369) increase over the current year based on FY 2013-14 rates and costs associated with the addition of staff.


Significant Program Changes
Based on changes to grant funding and program operations, a number of position changes are included in the recommended budget as follows:

Career Criminal – the transfer of two Deputy District Attorney positions from this Org to the District Attorney budget Org 2860. Funding for this unit was eliminated as a result of the state “trigger” cuts in FY 2011-12. The District Attorney will continue to advocate for the restoration of funding working closely with the California District Attorneys Association (CDAA) and California Emergency Management Agency (Cal EMA).

Consumer Protection – the District Attorney’s Office continues to restructure this program with the following action:

The deletion of one Senior District Attorney Investigator position. This position is currently vacant and the deletion will not impact ongoing activities.
As allowed by SB 1342 (Chapter 104, Statutes of 2012), in May 2013, the Board of Supervisors approved a $5 increase (from $3.00 to $8.00) in the real estate instrument recording fee (to be effective June 1, 2013) to add two Deputy District Attorneys, two Senior District Attorney Investigators, one Paralegal, and one Secretary positions to the Real Estate Fraud Prosecution unit to address the increasing and persistent caseload of these complex prosecutions. Full year funding for these positions, in addition to the Deputy District Attorney and Senior Investigator positions fully funded in the current year, is included in the recommended budget.
The NCC allocated to various grant programs reflects changes as follows:

IHSS Fraud (Org 28620600) – requires $555,013 in NCC due to the loss of state funding. The IHSS Fraud program is still eligible for federal funding reimbursement (up to 50% of approved costs) and $372,249 is estimated for FY 2013-14.

Indian Gaming (Org 28621000) – requires $79,572 of NCC due to a reduction in the Indian Gaming State Distribution Fund award.

The recommended net County cost also supports the programs of Training (Professional
Standards) and Administration, Life and Annuity, URBAN, ID Theft, Mid-Level Drug Suppression, Rural Crime, Waste Tire, and Victim Restitution.
Salaries and Benefits

Salaries and Benefits, recommended at $9,790,876, reflect a 4% ($386,518) increase over the FY 2012-13 adopted budget, primarily due to full-year funding of the positions associated with the expansion of the Real Estate Fraud unit.
Recommended funding includes:

The transfer of two Deputy District Attorney positions assigned to the Career Criminal program to budget Org 2860.

The deletion of one Senior District Attorney Investigator position due to restructuring of the Consumer Protection program.

Services and Supplies
Services and Supplies, recommended at $1,475,225, reflect a 4% ($50,723) increase over the current year adopted budget primarily due to increased costs associated with the expansion of the Real Estate Fraud unit.
Recommended funding includes:

Account 7430, Utilities reflects a 38% ($8,387) increase based on estimated usage and rates for FY 2013-14.
Other Charges

Other Charges, recommended at $184,841, represent a 29% ($41,773) increase over the FY 2012-13 Adopted Budget as a result of additional staffing and salaries impacting indirect costs.

Significant Program Changes
During the first quarter of FY 2012-13, the Superior Court of California, Fresno County (Superior Court) closed five outlying division criminal courts and replaced them with three additional courtrooms in downtown Fresno. As a result, clients whose cases would have been heard in outlying areas must travel to downtown Fresno for their Court hearings. In order to minimize the impact of Court closure to the Office, Public Defender staff was reassigned to the downtown office, staff functions were reorganized accordingly, and efficiencies in providing services to the public were attained.
The department faced numerous challenges in FY 2012-13 with increased workloads from several sources primarily 2011 Realignment, forced medication cases and Proposition 36 three strikes reform.
AB 109 – 2011 Public Safety Realignment Act
Under AB 109, California Public Safety Realignment shifts the responsibility for incarcerating and monitoring many low-risk offenders from the state to counties. The implementation of AB 109 continues to have a significant impact on the department. In FY 2012-13 the department experienced an increase in Post Release Community Supervision (PRCS) Hearings (802 cases through March 31, 2013 as compared to 302 cases between November 2011 and June 30, 2012). Additionally, Mandatory Supervised Release (MSR) violations have increased as well, with 55 cases through March 31, 2013 as compared to 16 cases between November 2011 and June 30, 2012. An additional staff attorney was added to handle the increased numbers of PRCS and MSR hearings. Funding for this additional
attorney position was provided by AB 118 with no increase in net County cost.
There were 20,303 cases appointed to the department during the first nine months of FY 2012-13. This equates to an increase of 8.2% (1,546) over the same period in FY 2011-12. These increases include a 16% (729) increase in new adult felony cases, a 600% (668) increase in Post Release Community Supervision (PRCS) cases and a 3.5% (325) increase in new adult misdemeanor cases. FY 2012-13 staff additions provided sufficient resources to absorb the workload increase. The department also expects an additional increase in cases beginning July 1, 2013, when 2011 Realignment will shift the responsibility of parole revocation hearings to the County. The full impacts of these parole revocation proceedings are unknown at this time.
Throughout the year the department provided several in-house training sessions to attorney staff on the AB 109 legislation that mandates “evidence-based” sentencing alternatives to incarceration. The department’s ongoing partnership with Alliant International University included training on evidence-based practices and risk assessment needs to enhance public safety by preventing recidivism.
Forced Medication Cases - Criminal Administrative Process (CRAD) Petitions for Involuntary Medication
Effective July 1, 2012, AB 366: Involuntary Antipsychotic Medication Hearing legislation was enacted and requires the state to now seek a court order authorizing the involuntary administration of antipsychotic medication for a Mentally Disordered Offender (MDO) or a Sexually Violent Predator (SVP) committed to a state mental hospital who refuses to take medication as prescribed. Coalinga State Hospital is located in Fresno County which houses both MDO and SVP offenders who have court commitments from other counties statewide. The legislation did not include a funding mechanism for forced medication hearing defense counsel. Since October 2012, as a cost containment strategy for the County, the Public Defender has accepted all CRAD cases filed by Coalinga State Hospital regardless of the originating county. As of March 31, 2013, the Public Defender has accepted a total of 36 Court-appointed CRAD cases with original commitments from 18 different counties throughout the State of California without an increase in net County cost. This created a cost-effective efficiency since the department already provides legal representation for newly filed criminal cases occurring at the Coalinga State Hospital. The County is actively seeking legislation to fund and secure reimbursement from offenders’ counties of origin that would cover the costs of providing additional services related to CRAD cases.
Proposition 36 (Penal Code §1170.126) - Three Strikes Reform Act of 2012
On November 6, 2012, California voters approved the Three Strikes Reform Act of 2012 (Proposition 36) amending the three strikes law and authorizing resentencing for certain offenders previously convicted of “three strikes” offenses and serving a life sentence. The office has received, in addition to relative phone calls, approximately 145 letters from prisoners statewide who were originally sentenced in Fresno County and are now requesting a resentencing under Proposition 36. The Assistant Public Defender, a Senior Defense Attorney and one paralegal, began the arduous task of researching each request to identify former public defender clients while working closely with the Court and other Justice Partners (including the District Attorney and Probation) to effectively administer these proceedings in a timely manner. As of March 31, 2013, the Public Defender has accepted appointment on 20 cases from the Superior Court for resentencing hearings which include former public defender clients, and clients whose original attorneys are now deceased or are no longer available. The full impact of these proceedings on the department is yet unknown; however, these cases require a significant amount of staff time. The Public Defender has absorbed this additional work within existing appropriations.
Salaries and Benefits

Salaries and Benefits, recommended at $11,070,228, represent a 1% decrease ($112,492) from FY 2012-13 Adopted Budget. This includes a recommended 88 positions, which represents an increase of 4 positions over the current fiscal year.

Account 6100, Regular Salaries represents a 1% ($4,368) decrease from current year due replacing senior staff retirements with lower level classifications, converting extra-help staff to

permanent positions and adding one office assistant position.

Account 6200, Extra-Help represents a 93% ($131,294) decrease from current year with $10,432 in funding recommended to allow for the retention of three existing extra-help Defense Attorney I positions until the transition to permanent status takes effect.

Account 6350, Unemployment Insurance represents a decrease of 55% ($13,922) primarily as a result of reduced rates provided by Risk Management.

Account 6600, Health Insurance contributions reflect an increase of 2% ($8,995) over the current fiscal year due to an increase in the number of covered employees.
Services and Supplies

Account 7416, Transportation and Travel County Garage represents a 29% decrease ($16,006) primarily due to the department returning two County vehicles no longer required with the closure of the outlying courtrooms.


Significant Program Changes
The recommended budget includes the addition of two Probation Technician positions. These positions will provide services in the Juvenile Justice Crime Prevention Act (JJCPA) program and support the Deputy Probation Officers assigned to this program. Support will include, in part, data collection, and providing verification of and progress reports on minors participating in the program.
SB 678 (Chapter 608, Statutes of 2009), the California Community Corrections Performance Incentives Act, provides funding from the state to counties based on the costs avoided by the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation due to a reduction in the percentage of adult probationers sent to prison from counties for a probation failure. The Governor’s FY 2013-14 May Revise includes a reduction in funding for SB 678. With the implementation of AB 109, many of the probation failures that are not sent to prison and were previously funded through SB 678 are now being addressed through and funded by AB 109 through 2011 Realignment.
Salaries and Benefits

Salaries and Benefits, recommended at $23,189,484, represent a 2% ($564,608) increase over the current year adopted budget primarily due to the addition of two positions and increases in employee retirement and overtime costs. Staffing is recommended at 252 positions, an increase of 2 positions.

Other Charges of $864,000 represent a 148% ($516,000) increase over the current year adopted budget based on increases in bed costs charged by the State for housing Department of Juvenile Justice (DJJ) placements as ordered by the Fresno Superior Court. The annual cost per bed at DJJ increased from $2,580 (for category 1-4 wards) and $22,288 (for category 5 wards) to $24,000 per bed for all wards starting in the current fiscal year for new commitments only.

Significant Program Changes
In FY 2012-13 the Board of Supervisors budget was reorganized into separate budgetary divisions for each member’s district as well as the Clerk to the Board. Divisionalization of the Board’s budget has afforded the opportunity for each Board member to monitor use of their district and overall departmental appropriations. Included in the division budgets are staff Salaries and Benefits as well as Services and Supplies. Additionally, Board member travel on behalf of the County, such as the One-Voice trip to Washington D.C. and representation for the California State Association of Counties (CSAC), is budgeted separately so as to clearly reflect that those appropriations are not included within each district’s divisional budgets.

Significant Program Changes
In FY 2012-13, the Superior Court transferred two responsibilities to the County Administrative Office.

The responsibility for all support functions required for the operation of the Grand Jury, including all Grand Jury investigation correspondence, press releases, publishing reports and coordinating and training members.

The responsibility of reviewing claims for payment for court appointed defense attorneys, experts and other ancillary service providers for indigent parties in both criminal and civil matters. The payment review function, which is conducted prior to judge’s approval for payment, was previously completed by Superior Court personnel. The impact of the claims review process has resulted in a significant increase in CAO staff resources and is projected to reach a total cost of $80,000 for FY 2012-13; these additional operational costs have been absorbed by the department.
On September 11, 2012, the Board transferred the Compliance Org 5635 from the County Administrative Office to the Department of Behavioral Health.

Maintenance-Buildings & Grounds ($600,000) – Reflects a 20% ($150,000) decrease from the FY 2012-13 Adopted Budget, based on projected expenditures for emergency repairs.

The POB portion ($4,850) is 100% offset from rates charged to the County to cover POB debt. The ACTTC administers these activities.

Bond Counsel ($84,700) – Recommended at the same level as the FY 2012-13 Adopted Budget for services required from an outside bond counsel.

Driver Alliant Insurance Liability ($275) – Recommended at the same level as the FY 2012-13 Adopted Budget for the Retirement Board's insurance coverage.

Council of Governments (COG) Membership Dues ($15,500) – Recommended at the same level as the FY 2012-13 Adopted Budget for annual membership dues that are required through the COG Joint Powers Agreement (JPA).

Participation in the JPA is necessary for the County to have a voice in regional decision-making and programming of hundreds of millions of dollars in regional and local transportation funding. The CAO administers this item.

Facility Operation & Maintenance for Vacant Spaces ($1,800,000) – Reflects a 10% ($200,000) decrease from the FY 2012-13 Adopted Budget based on updated actual and estimated costs of utilities, and maintenance of vacant County building spaces including University Medical Center, Elkhorn bootcamp, and the 10th Street Juvenile Hall/Court facilities. These estimates could be reduced or offset as a result of the Board's direction to consider the sale, lease or increased use of County properties. The costs do not benefit specific entities and therefore cannot be charged to departments or grants. As such, the Facility Services ISF would not be able to recover revenues for these costs, so funding for this purpose needs to be absorbed by the General Fund (Org 2540, Account 7345). The ISD administers this activity.

Transportation, Travel & Education ($2,000) – Recommended at the same level as the FY 2012-13 Adopted Budget for travel costs needed in order to get Standard & Poors bond ratings associated with TRAN borrowing.

Other Charges

The Superior Court shares in the use of the facility, and their share of the debt payment (58.5%), is funded by the Administrative Office of the Courts through Court Ancillary Services Org 2838. The County’s share of debt is offset by up to $500,000 in annual Civil Assessment Fee revenues received from the Superior Court.

Tax Revenue Anticipation Notes (TRAN) ($2,700,000) recommended at the same level as FY
2012-13 and is based on an estimated $90M debt issuance at 3%. Once confirmed, if the final TRAN debt issuance amount and interest rate result in a debt requirement that is less than what is budgeted, any savings would be available for re-appropriation as approved by the Board.
More information on the above debt service payments is available in the Narrative for Org 0124–Debt Service. The ACTTC administers these activities.


Significant Program Changes
On August 28, 2012, the Fresno County Financing Authority, authorized the sale and issuance of lease revenue refunding bonds to “refund” (refinance) the County’s previously issued and outstanding Lease Revenue Bonds Series 2004 (Juvenile Justice Campus, Acct. 7864) and Series 2004B (Downtown Energy Projects Acct. 7865). The refinancing was structured to realize debt service savings to the County by reducing the number of total County debt service payments in relation to the 2004 Bonds, the Net Present Value savings associated with the refinancing is $2.79 million. The 2012 LRRB were issued in the amount of $22,425,000 with final maturity in FY 2022-23.
Other Charges

The following provides a summary of recommended funding for the County’s long and short-term debt obligations, which includes the required FY 2013-14 debt service payments for two different issuances of LRBs and the TRAN:
Juvenile Court Facility LRBs (Account 7853):

A total of $55,350,000 in LRBs was issued by the Fresno County Financing Authority in 2007 to finance costs associated with the construction of a shared use Juvenile Court Facility and offices to be located at the Juvenile Justice Campus. Usage of the Juvenile Court Facility is being shared by Fresno County and the Superior Court. The total principal amount of the Annual Base Rental (Lease) Payments is $55,350,000 and is to be paid by the County. The County leases a portion of the facility and offices to the Administrative Office of the Courts (AOC), whose share of the Base Rental Payments is 58.5% of the annual payment. The bonds have a 23-year maturity and include two years of capitalized interest. The total debt service payment for FY 2013-14 is $4,084,272 and is due in two installments: interest in October 2013 and principal and interest in April 2014. See debt service schedule following this narrative for the current and long-term annual debt service amounts.

Principal Balance as of June 30, 2013 ...............................$48,165,000
Remaining Payment Period ...............................................17 years
2013-14 Debt Service Payment .........................................$4,084,272

(NOTE: An additional $1 has been budgeted in the PeopleSoft financial system for rounding purposes reflecting a budget total of $4,084,273.) The AOC’s share of the $4,084,273 is $2,389,300 (58.5%), and the County’s share is $1,694,973 (41.5%). The recommended amount of $4,084,273 reflects a $1,201 decrease from FY 2012-13.
2012 Lease Revenue Refunding Bond (LRRB) Series 2012A (Account 7864)

A total of $22,425,000 in LRRBs was issued by the Fresno County Financing Authority in 2012 to refund (refinance) the County’s previously issued and outstanding Lease Revenue Bonds Series 2004 (Juvenile Justice Campus) and Series 2004B (Energy Projects). The bonds have a 10-year maturity. The total debt service payment for FY 2013-14 is $3,245,250 and is due in two installments: principal and interest in August 2013 and interest in February 2014. See debt service schedule following this narrative for the current and long-term annual debt service amounts.
Principal Balance as of June 30, 2013 .....................................$22,425,000
Remaining Payment Period .....................................................10 years
2013-14 Debt Service Payment ...............................................$3,245,250

The recommended amount of $3,245,250 reflects a $12,740 decrease from the total amount budgeted for the JJC and Downtown Energy Projects in FY 2012-13.
Tax Revenue Anticipation Notes (TRAN) (Account 7867)

For the past 35 years, the Board of Supervisors has authorized a short-term borrowing program through the issuance of a TRAN. The TRAN enables the County to maintain a positive cash flow until anticipated taxes and revenues are received throughout the fiscal year.
The recommended funding of $2,700,000 for FY 2013-14 is based on an assumed $90,000,000 debt issuance at 3% interest rate. This represents the same level of funding as recommended for FY 2012-13, if the final debt issuance amount and interest rate for FY 2013-14 result in a debt requirement that is significantly less than what is budgeted, any savings would be available for re-appropriation as approved by the Board.

Upon receipt, TRAN funds are deposited into an interest bearing account. Funding for the interest payment is transferred from the Interest and Miscellaneous Expenditures budget, where it is budgeted as net County cost.
Other Information
Pension Obligation Bonds (POB)

Fresno County has issued POBs on three occasions. In March 1998, Fresno County issued $184,910,000 of taxable POBs with an 11-year amortization to fund the Unfunded Actuarial Accrued Liability (UAAL) of the Fresno County Employee’s Retirement Association. In March 2002, these bonds were partially refunded in order to extend the debt servicing of the bonds to an 18-year amortization period to provide budget relief. In addition, in 2004, a total of $327,897,749 in fixed rate bonds were issued with a 30-year amortization, and a total of $75 million in variable rate bonds were issued. The $75 million variable rate bonds were converted to fixed rate bonds on September 12, 2006 at a fixed rate of 5.56%. The maturity schedule of the converted bonds remained the same. In FY 2008-09 the debt service for the 1998 POBs was completed. The County is currently paying the annual debt service for three POB issuances. A total of $38,138,796 in debt service payments is required in FY 2013-14, which includes all administration fees associated with the bonds. See debt service schedule and remaining maturity for all three issuances following this narrative.

Principal Balance as of June 30, 2013................................$439,877,749
Remaining Payment Period ...............................................Varied
2013-14 Debt Service Payment..........................................$38,138,796

Amounts necessary to timely pay the POB debt service payments have been incorporated into the County’s FY 2013-14 retirement rates and are collected from departments each pay period.


Significant Program Changes
Contingencies
Contingencies are recommended at $750,000, which reflects a 50% ($249,532) increase from the FY 2012-13 Adopted Budget of $500,468. On August 7, 2012, $21,726 was transferred to Park & Grounds Org 7910, to replace the heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems at the Kearney Mansion. On February 5, 2013, $210,842 was transfer to the Department of Public Health Org 5620, to pay for one-time startup costs associated with establishing an animal control facility. On March 12, 2013, $12,450 was transferred to the Interest & Miscellaneous Org 2540, to conduct an appraisal of the Juvenile Justice Campus farmland and farm houses. On April 23, 2013, $233,135 was transferred to the Assessor-Recorder Org 0420 to partially mitigate the loss of Property Tax Administrative Fee (PTAF) revenue. Contingencies require a 4/5th vote to access funding.
General Reserves
A $1,500,000 contribution to the General Reserves is recommended for FY 2013-14. With this contribution, the General Reserve balance will increase to $14,443,004 to address potential future liabilities, which include disallowance of Pension Obligation Bond (POB) costs claimed to third party funding sources, such as federal grants, for a portion of the refinanced pension obligation bonds, estimated at $36 million. Principles governing federal cost reimbursements are set out in Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-87 (A-87). OMB A-87 treats pension plan costs as fringe benefits that are allowable to be claimed. However, the County of Fresno refinanced certain POB’s prior to the issuance of guidelines relative to allowable costs. To date, no federal claims have been denied reimbursement for reasons concerning claiming POB costs. The General Reserve, except in cases of a legally declared emergency may only be decreased at the time of adopting the budget. The general
reserve may be increased any time during the fiscal year by a 4/5th vote.
Designations
Two designations have been included in the recommended FY 2013-14 budget, a 100% ($16,939,456) increase over the FY 2012-13 Adopted Budget. Designations require a 4/5th vote to access funding.
Proposition 42 Maintenance-of-Effort
A designation in the amount of $5,569,392 has been reserved for the payment of the Prop 42 Maintenance of Effort (MOE) that is due to the Road Fund by June 30, 2015. In FY 2009-10 the adopted budget included Proposition 42 funding that required an MOE contribution from the County’s General Fund in the amount of $5,569,392. The FY 2009-10 MOE payment was deferred in accordance with California Revenue and Taxation Code Section 7104.2(f)(6) until FY 2010-11. Legislative action allowed the County to further defer the payment until June 30, 2015. The Board of Supervisors is exploring legislative options which may reduce, postpone or eliminate this MOE payment. The recommendation to create a designation will allow the County to pay the Prop 42 MOE in the event that payment is required on or before June 30, 2015.
Budget Mitigation
A designation in the amount of $11,367,064 has been reserved for County budget mitigation. This represents the amount of funding available for the Board in making adjustments in budget hearings, to mitigate potential impacts in the FY 2013-14 State Budget or during the fiscal year.


Significant Program Changes
The recommended budget includes the addition of three new positions: two Personnel Analysts and one Personnel Technician Confidential. One Personnel Analyst position will be assigned to the Employment Services division with primary responsibility of classification and compensation analysis. The Classification and Compensation Program was eliminated several years ago due to a necessary reduction in staff triggered by budget constraints. Consequently, only classification and compensation studies requested by the Board of Supervisors or the County Administrative Officer have been conducted (five in the past five years). The addition of an analyst will allow Personnel Services to resume this mandated function, with a focus on the Social Services agencies and other departments with revenue offset to allow funding for the position. In addition, the analyst position will enhance Personnel’s efforts in assuring that all County class specifications are reviewed and updated as required by the State.
The second Personnel Analyst, and the Personnel Technician, will be assigned to the Labor Relations division, which has long been understaffed. Presently, the division has one analyst assigned to negotiations and one analyst assigned to employee grievances. Due to a reduction in staffing over the last several years, as a result of budget constraints, it has been necessary for the Labor Relations Manager to assist with all negotiations, including policy changes and other impact negotiations, which are duties typically assigned to an Analyst. The addition of an analyst and technician will allow the Labor Relations Manager to focus more on managing the day-to-day operations of the division, ensure compliance with mandated timelines, and provide a proactive focus to labor issues as they arise in an effort to resolve them at the lowest possible level.
Salaries and Benefits

Salaries and Benefits, recommended at $2,497,901 reflect a 9% ($209,217) increase over FY 2012-13, due to the recommended addition of three positions.
Recommended funding includes:

Staffing at 26 positions, an increase of 3 positions over current year.

A projected 1% ($14,305) salary savings from attrition throughout the year.

A 10% ($130,234) increase to Account 6100 Regular Salaries primarily due to the addition of three new positions.

A 13% ($88,349) increase to Account 6400 Retirement Contribution, based on an increase to retirement rates and to the addition of three new positions.

A 9% ($12,993) increase to Account 6600 Health Insurance Contribution, resulting from the combined effect of adding three new positions and reduced costs of existing positions due to an increase to the number of employees who have opted out of County-provided health insurance.
Services and Supplies

Services and Supplies, recommended at $745,157, reflect a 17% ($107,017) increase over the FY 2012-13 Adopted Budget, primarily due to increases to pass-through reimbursable costs for recruitment and pre-employment activities, as well as for costs associated with the Civil Service Commission. A portion of the increase to Services and Supplies is also attributable to increased Data Processing Services Charges assessed by ISD.
Recommended funding includes:

$404,500 in appropriations (54% of recommended Services and Supplies) for projected pass-through or reimbursable costs for which equal revenue has been included, resulting in no net County cost. Reimbursable costs include recruitment advertising, written examinations, pre-employment medical and psychological exams, and a portion of costs related to the Civil Service Commission.

A 14% ($10,107) increase to Account 7296 Data Processing Services as projected by ISD based on current year usage.

A 22% ($11,982) decrease to Account 7345 Facilities Operation and Maintenance as estimated by ISD Facilities.

A 72% ($50,450) increase to appropriations for the Civil Service Commission driven by an increase in appeals related to Countywide discipline and other civil service appeals.


Significant Program Changes
The recommended budget includes the addition of one Personnel Analyst position. This position will be responsible for coordinating and expanding the training program to other County departments with the goal of reducing the County’s exposure to claims in the areas of workers’ compensation, general liability, and employee grievances, thereby reducing costs of these programs. The Personnel Analyst will also be

tasked with researching the feasibility of an aggressive workers’ compensation “Return to Work Program,” and creating an implementation plan. Implementation of this program could result in material cost savings in the workers’ compensation program.
Salaries and Benefits

Salaries and Benefits, recommended at $2,497,258 reflect a 1% ($29,474) decrease from the FY 2012-13 Adopted Budget. Including the recommended addition of one position, the decrease to Salaries and Benefits is based on several factors, which include filling positions at lower levels, and reductions in the workers’ compensation and benefit administration rates.
Recommended funding includes:

Staffing at 28 positions, which includes the addition of one Personnel Analyst I position, as explained in the Significant Program Changes section.

A 0.1% decrease to Regular Salaries ($2,022), including the addition of one new position. The cost of the recommended position will be offset with savings in regular salaries, which were a result of filling vacant positions at lower levels and/or steps during FY 2012-13.

A 3% ($25,193) increase to Account 6400, Retirement Contribution due to increased retirement rates and additional position.

A 67% ($20,813) decrease to Account 6550, Workers’ Compensation Contribution resulting from a reduced claim history over the last seven years.

A 6% ($9,846) decrease to Account 6600, Health insurance Contribution driven by an increase in the number of employees that have opted out of County health coverage.

A 100% ($12,000) decrease to Account 6200, Extra-Help, as no salaries for extra-help staff are being recommended due to the addition of the Personnel Analyst position.
Services and Supplies

Services and Supplies, recommended at $95,358,309 represent less than a 1% ($590,087) increase over the FY 2012-13 Adopted Budget, primarily due to an increase in projected payments to health plans for active employees and their dependents (pass-through expense).
Recommended funding includes:

Appropriations of $71,648,819, which reflect a 2% ($1,596,931) increase over current year, for Countywide health premium payments for active and retired employees. This estimate is based on current year enrollment at 2013 health plan premium rates provided by the San Joaquin Valley Insurance Authority (SJVIA), plus a conservative contingency for enrollment growth. The total appropriations include both the employer and employee portion of health premiums, as the full premium amount must be accounted for within the Risk Management fund.

Projected Unemployment Insurance program costs of $1,557,518 a decrease of 31% ($713,795) from current year adopted budget. This projected decrease in costs is based on recent trends of reduced Unemployment Insurance claims filed by former County employees.

A decrease of 100% ($8,643,566) to Account 7138, Prescription Medical. The Prescription Medical Self-Insurance program that was previously funded by the County was closed at the end of the 2012 plan year. Prescription coverage is now part of appropriations in Account 7170 Active Employees Health Premiums, as coverage is provided by the SJVIA.

Projected Professional & Specialized Services costs of $2,214,580, a decrease of 5% ($103,429) from the current year adopted budget. This decrease is primarily associated with reductions in contract amounts with third-party administrators for workers’ compensation and health administration.

Projected Property Insurance program costs of $242,326, an increase of 142% ($142,326) from

the current year adopted budget. The increase to estimated costs is based on current year trends of increased claims and claim amounts filed by County departments for property damage.


Significant Program Changes

General and Special Accounting will continue with reduced office hours to the public and employees (9 a.m. to 12 p.m. and 1 p.m. to 4 p.m.). The reduced office hours will allow staff additional time within the day to process workload.

Additional staff resources will continue to be dedicated to the Redevelopment Agency Dissolution process for the implementation of ABX1 26-SA.

Additional staffing resources will be required to implement enhanced reporting requirements for Health Care Reform Act, Federal and State reporting and withholding requirements for vendors and employees and financial/human resource systems for changes in labor memorandums of understanding agreements.

Phase out of the Auditor-Controller as the Local Government Agency (LGA) coordinator for Medi-Cal

Administrative Activities (MAA) and Target Case Management (TCM) services as result of program changes and withdrawal of participating agencies.

Implementation of Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) pronouncements that will change the format and presentation of County financial statements.

Addition of three Account Clerk and one Collection Representative positions to Revenue Collections unit will increase the collection of revenues for the County of Fresno.
Salaries and Benefits

Salaries and Benefits, recommended at $8,758,931, represent a net of 3% ($289,712) increase over the FY 2012-13 Adopted Budget, primarily due to the cost of eight new additional positions and increases in Regular Salaries, Retirement, Overtime, Workers’ Compensation that are partially offset by decreases in Unemployment Insurance, Health Insurance and Benefits Administration costs. Also, included is a 2% ($173,900) salary and related benefit savings.
Recommended funding includes:

Account 6100, Regular Salaries reflects a 4% ($174,727) increase over the current year Adopted Budget primarily due to addition of eight positions.

Account 6300, Overtime reflects a 24% ($2,717) increase over the current year Adopted Budget which is necessary to ensure timely processing of property tax collections during December 10 and April 10 property tax due dates.

Account 6400, Retirement Contribution reflects a 4% ($113,194) increase over the current year Adopted Budget due to increased rates and the addition of eight positions.

Account 6550, Workers’ Compensation reflects a 41% ($12,674) increase over the current year Adopted Budget based on utilization.

Account 6670, Benefits Administration reflects a 15% ($2,178) decrease from due to decreased rates.
Services and Supplies

Recommended funding includes:

Account 7101, General Liability Insurance reflects a 25% ($2,630) decrease due to reduced rates provided by Risk Management.

Account 7175, Insurance Other reflects a 16% ($1,245) decrease due to reduced rates provided by Risk Management.

Account 7250, Memberships reflects an 11% (7,436) decrease mainly due to reduction in the Medi-Cal Administrative Activities (MAA) and Targeted Case Management (TCM) memberships with Marin County.

Account 7288, Data Processing Direct reflects a 6% ($20,803) increase primarily for reclassifying ProSystem charges from Account 7295 to 7288 ($12,500) as well increased vendor costs for providing services for Collections Systems (CUBS), Bloomberg Investment Software, and Sympro Fixed Income Asset Management.

Account 7295, Professional & Specialized Services reflect a 4% ($30,158) decrease primarily for reduced Internet auction and title search fees associated with performing a delinquent property tax sale. In FY 2012-13, delinquent property tax sales were conducted for two years and as a result expenditures associated with sales were higher. In FY 2013-14, one year of property tax sales will be conducted resulting in decreased expenditures.

Account 7296, Data Processing Services reflects a 3% ($12,122) decrease due to reduced rates provided by ISD.

Account 7345, Facility Services Rent reflects a 17% ($37,210) increase due to higher rates provided by ISD.

Account 7385, Small Tools & Instruments reflect a 320% ($1,600) increase primarily due to budgeting fixed assets purchases under $5,000 into this account instead of Account 7265, Office Expense, in FY 2013-14.

Account 7430, Utilities reflects a 10% ($11,053) increase due to higher rates provided by ISD.

Account 7611, Security Services reflects a 60% ($7,391) increase due to higher rates provided by ISD.


Significant Program Changes
Midway through FY 2012-13, the County was notified that it would receive reduced Property Tax Administrative Fee (PTAF) revenue that had the greatest impact for the Assessor with an unanticipated current year revenue shortfall of approximately $1,000,000. To respond to the loss of revenues, the department invoked the layoff process of Assessor staffing that resulted a reduction of staff who conduct property assessments causing additional delays in assessments and reassessments and increasing corrections required to the assessment roll.
Salaries and Benefits

Salaries and Benefits, recommended at $9,962,736, represent a 11% ($1,274,514) decrease from the current year adopted budget. Staffing is recommended at 111 positions, reflecting a decrease of 2 positions from current year budget.

This account also includes the department’s portion of the cost of a Systems & Procedures Analyst (SPA) Manager ($76,519) position; a cost that is shared with the AC/TTC. The sum of $150,000 is also included for consultant services related to a process transition for the County’s Property Assessment System.

Account 7296, Data Processing Services represents a 2% ($23,360) increase over the current year budget and includes a one-time expense for data connections due to the anticipated remodel of the Vital Records unit.

Significant Program Changes
For the first time, NCC for outside legal services is being budgeted in Org 0710, instead of Org 2540. The CAO has recommended an NCC contribution of $210,000 for FY 2013-14 outside legal services. We have budgeted this expenditure in its own line item (Account 7294-Professional Specialized Services – Contract) and will only use these funds for outside legal services. County Counsel will not use it for any other purpose, nor does the department plan to use its departmental NCC contribution of $1,805,156 to pay for outside legal services. Should the $210,000 not be a sufficient amount for outside legal

services, County Counsel will advise the Board of Supervisors that additional funds are necessary.
Staffing is recommended at 31 positions, reflecting an increase of 3 positions over FY 2012-13 Adopted Budget. One Deputy County Counsel I and one Secretary II positions are recommended to be added to current staffing to avoid service reductions to NCC departments. An Accountant I/II position is recommended to be added to current staffing to handle payment of vendors, invoicing of clients, preparation and monitoring of department budget, and other financial matters as the volume and complexity of County Counsel’s billing and finances has significantly increased over time.

Significant Program Changes
The Significant Program Changes for the Department of Behavioral Health are highlighted below.
The department contracted with Exodus Recovery, Inc. and opened the Exodus Crisis Stabilization Center in FY 2012-13 for the operation of a crisis stabilization center to provide services to clients who are 18 years or older, who are exhibiting acute psychiatric symptoms that have been placed on a 5150 designation or on a voluntary basis.

As of July 1, 2013, the department will contract Adult and Children’s Rural Services. This includes the Kerman Clinic, the Selma Regional Center Clinic, and the Coalinga Regional Center Clinic. This is projected to reduce stress on the department’s limited resources, increase mental health outpatient treatment services by increasing system capacity with provider, and allow future capacity to serve effectively the expected increase in the number of Severely Emotionally Disturbed (SED) referrals for mental health assessment and treatment under Affordable Care Act and Healthy Families.
The “Katie A.” class action lawsuit against the State of California was settled on December 1, 2011, and will require counties to expand the array and intensity of mental health services to children who are in foster care or at imminent risk of foster care placement by summer of 2012. The department has included MHSA funding allocated for the Team Decision Making program and 2011 Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis and Treatment (EPSDT) Realignment funding required complying with the Core Practice Model that includes the provision of Intensive Care Coordination and Intensive Home-Based Mental Health Services.
On May 14, 2013, the Board approved the transfer of the Compliance Program and all related staff and expenses to Org 5630 – Behavioral Health, effective June 24, 2013. Org 5635 will be dissolved and no appropriations or revenues have been budgeted for FY 2013-14 within Org 5635.
On March 23, 2010, the President signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA). The Affordable Care Act includes mental health and substance abuse disorders as one of the ten included categories. The ACA includes provisions to expand Medi-Cal coverage to adults solely based on an income under 138% of the Federal Poverty Level and to enhance overage for currently eligible individuals. As a result, many indigent adults currently receiving care in the department of Behavioral Health will become eligible for Medi-Cal as of January 2014, shifting the cost of services from Mental Health Realignment to Federal reimbursement. In 2020, Federal Financial Participation will be reduced to 90%. This cost sharing arrangement has the potential to free up Mental Health Realignment funds.

Significant Program Changes
As part of the FY 2012-13 State Budget, the legislature passed Assembly Bill (AB) 1494, which provided for the transition of Healthy Families Program enrollees to the Medi-Cal Program effective January 1, 2013. Healthy Families is the current, State-administered program that provides low-cost insurance for children, teens, and pregnant mothers. The transition to the County-administered Medi-Cal Program will shift 20,457 Healthy Families cases to the County, or a 25% caseload increase, and increase the number of new applications for assistance received per month by 440 (12% increase). The 45 positions added in the current year and implementation of the DSS Service Center allowed the department to absorb and handle the increased workload due to the Healthy Families transition. The total cost of the added positions is 100% funded through the Medi-Cal Administrative Allocation.
The department implemented the DSS Service Center (Service Center) for the CalFresh and Medi-Cal Programs in the current year. The Service Center is a significant change in business processes and is a Client Needs Based/Task Management business model with a “no wrong door” policy, where clients can access services through multiple channels including Service Center locations, through web-based applications (Benefits CalWIN) and through the Department’s Call Center. Under the new model, the department transitioned from “one worker/one case” case management to task-based management, where intake and ongoing case maintenance eligibility functions are converted into tasks and equitably distributed among workers. The Service Center is focused on improving customer service, leveraging new or improved technology, increasing quality assurance, and improving business efficiencies to assist the department in addressing future change.
The scheduled implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in October 2013 will make changes and significantly increase the workload in the Medi-Cal Program. According to State estimates, the department will receive an estimated 45,011 applications for expanded Medi-Cal and 16,875 applications for Covered California health insurance subsidies and products in 2014, which represents a 94% increase in intake applications per worker. Ongoing Medi-Cal cases are expected to increase by 39,733 cases, or a 261% increase in ongoing caseloads to a total of 141,411 ongoing cases. The 93 positions added in the current year to address this workload reflects significant efficiency assumptions based on estimated caseloads, technology, and policy assumptions. The department will continue to evaluate staffing needs as pending factors are assessed and may return to your Board with additional staffing recommendations during the budget year. Cost of positions will be fully offset with State and Federal revenues from the Medi-Cal and CalWIN Allocations.
Salaries and Benefits

Salaries and Benefits, recommended at $175,339,896 represent a 6% ($9,491,960) increase over the current year adopted budget primarily due to the full-year funding for 138 positions that were added midyear for Healthy Families transition and preparation for implementation of ACA in October 2013, Retirement Contribution rate increases, and anticipated cost of promotions.

Estimated welfare repayments in the amount of $32,948. These costs are incurred by the department and therefore funds are budgeted in the recommended funding, but are reduced from the total cost claimed under Federal and Non-Fed Aid to Adoptions cases.


Significant Program Changes
Senate Bill (SB) 1041 repealed the prior Budget Act of 2011 action and restored the Earned Income Disregard (EID) for CalWORKs recipients. Currently, the EID used in the grant calculation for CalWORKs recipients is up to the first $112 of earned income per month. Effective October 1, 2013, the first $225 per month of initial earned income and 50% of any remaining earned income will be disregarded from the grant calculation. On average, an estimated 220 cases in FY 2013-14 will remain eligible each month instead of being discontinued as a result of earnings over the eligibility limit. This equates to a $56 increase in grants, which is approximately $147,840 annually.
Additionally, SB 1041 created new time limitations on the Employment Services Welfare to Work (WTW) 24-month time clock and alignment of CalWORKs hourly work requirements to federal participation requirements with changes to certain WTW exemptions. These changes were effective January 1, 2013; however, it is anticipated that the WTW 24-month clock limitation will not have an impact until January 1, 2015.

Significant Program Changes
Assembly Bill (AB) 12 authorized several changes to Foster Care and Kin-GAP including increasing the upper child age limit eligibility from 18 years to 19 years beginning January 2012 and from 19 years to 20 years beginning January 2013. Prior to the AB 12 Extended Foster Care (EFC) Program, the Courts could order foster care for a child over 18 and the County would be required to issue 100% County funds for the placement of the child. EFC added two years of eligibility for qualifying children and provided offsetting funding for federal-eligible cases. Participation in AB 12 Extended Foster Care (EFC) is voluntary for the youth, and youth can exit and enter the program at any time prior to their eligibility expiring. The FY 2013-14 Recommended Budget includes an estimated 165 cases per month in EFC, based on the current year trend.

Significant Program Changes
Effective July 1, 2012, the State implemented a Maintenance-of-Effort (MOE) for the IHSS Program. Prior to the IHSS MOE, the County share-of-cost for IHSS was determined through statutory sharing ratios and the County was responsible for approximately 17.6% of the total cost of the IHSS Program. Under the MOE, the County share-of-cost became a set amount that was equal to the actual County share-of-cost incurred by each County for FY 2011-12. The County must pay that set amount regardless of the actual IHSS Program expenditures. Through the IHSS MOE, the County will not be financially impacted by any caseload increases; however, the County will also not realize any financial savings resulting from caseload decreases. Based on current statute, the IHSS MOE can be increased by the State for the following reasons: 1) County negotiated wage and/or benefits increases that take effect after July 1, 2012; and 2) an annual inflation factor of 3.5% beginning July 1, 2014, and each year thereafter, with the exception of years where there is ‘negative growth’ in 1991 Realignment.
In March 2013, the State and the IHSS beneficiaries and labor organizations reached a settlement resolving two of the major lawsuits being heard by the federal courts regarding reduction of State participation in IHSS wages and the State proposed 20% across the board reduction in IHSS hours. The settlement rescinds the reduction of State participation in IHSS provider wages, but will reinstate a 3.6% across the board reduction in hours that was scheduled to sunset on July 1, 2013 in addition to a 4.4% reduction, for a total of 8% reduction in hours. The recommended budget accounts for appropriations related to the total health benefits cost payment decreases due to the 8% reduction in hours. However, as the County share of health benefit costs are a set amount as part of the IHSS MOE, the cost savings associated with the 8% reduction will be recovered by the State.

Other Charges

Recommended funding of $37,657,571 reflects an 8% ($3,429,949) decrease from the Adopted FY 2012-13 Budget, includes the reinstatement of the across the board 3.6% reduction in hours and an additional 4.4% reduction (total of 8%), effective July 1, 2013.
Recommended funding includes:

In-Home Supportive Services (IHSS) MOE for FY 2013-14 of $26,468,483.

Provider health benefits of $11,189,088 based on the benefit rate of $0.85 per hour and a projected 1,096,969 average paid hours per month for FY 2013-14.

Significant Program Changes
Effective July 1, 2012, the State implemented Maintenance-of-Effort (MOE) for the IHSS Program, which is comprised of three components: IHSS Administration, IHSS Services, and Public Authority Administration. Prior to the IHSS MOE, the County share-of-cost for the Public Authority was determined through statutory sharing ratios and the County was responsible for approximately 17.6% of the total cost. Under the MOE, the County share-of-cost became a set amount that was equal to the actual share-of-cost incurred by each county for FY 2011-12. The County must pay that set amount regardless of the actual Public Authority expenditures. Through the IHSS MOE, the County will not be financially impacted by any expenditure increases; however, the County will also not realize any financial savings resulting from expenditure decreases. Based on the current statute, the IHSS MOE can be increased by the State for an annual inflation factor of 3.5% beginning July 1, 2014, and each year thereafter, with the exception of years where there is ‘negative growth’ in 1991 Realignment. The FY 2013-14 Recommended Budget reflects the IHSS MOE amount for the Public Authority. Any costs incurred above the MOE will be reimbursed by the State with State and Federal funds.
On March 4, 2013, the Case Management Information Payrolling System II (CMIPS II) was implemented to replace the existing system. CMIPS II created new processes which required staff to conduct new tasks. The FY 2013-14 Recommended Budget reflects the Department of Social Services (DSS) administrative overhead charges of approximately $608,212 which is an increase from FY 2012-13 Adopted Budget of $370,435 or 156%. The increase reflects anticipated DSS Overhead Charge

increases due to CMIPS II implementation and programmatic changes which were necessary to address additional workload processes.
Salaries and Benefits

Salaries and Benefits, recommended at $530,612, represent a 2% ($11,163) increase over the current year adopted budget. Staffing is recommended at seven positions and represents no change from current year adopted budget.
Recommended funding includes:

Account 6100, Regular Salaries represents an increase of 1% ($3,153), which includes full-year funding for seven positions.

Account 6350, Unemployment Insurance includes a 35% ($471) decrease from the current year adopted budget based on Risk Management rates.

Account 6400, Retirement Contributions includes a 5% ($6,757) increase over the current year adopted budget based on changes in salary costs and the updated Retirement rate.

Account 6500, OASDI Contribution includes a 1% ($241) increase over the current year adopted budget based on actual OASDI rates applied to projected regular salary costs.

Account 6550, Workers’ Compensation Contribution includes a 5% ($1,558) increase over the current year adopted budget based on Risk Management rates.

Account 6670, Benefits Administration includes an 11% ($105) decrease from the current year adopted budget based on Risk Management rates.

Salary savings are not included due to the small size of the department and minimal staffing of seven positions.
Services and Supplies

Services and Supplies, recommended at $994,517, represent a 102% ($502,026) increase over the current year primarily due to CMIPS II implementation and the inclusion of the Public Authority MOE invoice, which is partially offset by reductions in other costs.
Recommended funding includes:

Account 7040, Telephone Charges includes a 10% ($237) increase based on IT communication rates.

Account 7101, Liability Risk includes a 13% ($304) decrease based on Risk Management rates.

Account 7265, Office Expense includes a 108% ($2,593) increase based on current year actuals.

Account 7266, Interoffice Mail includes a 2% ($65) increase based on Internal Services – Graphic Communications rates.

Account 7269, Printing includes a 33% ($1,750) increase due to implementation of new State forms for Provider enrollment and orientations, and an increase in Provider enrollments.

Account 7286, PeopleSoft HR Charges includes a 24% ($269) increase based on PeopleSoft budget rates.

Account 7287, PeopleSoft Financial Charges includes a 17% ($338) decrease based on PeopleSoft budget rates.

Account 7294, Professional & Specialized Services-Contracts includes a 2% ($441) increase for the cost of the HOMCare Registry Provider software.

Account 7295, Professional and Specialized Services reflect a 131% ($495,223) increase which is primarily due to the IHSS Public Authority MOE ($128,287) and estimated time spent by DSS

staff in Org 5610 performing Public Authority functions ($370,435) as a result of CMIPS II implementation. The increase in activities provided to this Org by Org 5610 is estimated to be high during the first full-year of the new CMIPS II System, as staff incorporates and becomes familiar with the new process and forms required. There has also been an increase in consumer inquiries due to the change, which has impacted the level of support this Org has needed. However, as both consumers and employees become familiar with the new procedures, it is anticipated that Org 5610 support will return to its normal levels prior to implementation of CMIPS II. This increase in cost does not impact the County’s share-of-cost for the IHSS Public Authority. Because of the MOE, the County’s share for this Org is set at the FY 2011-12 level and any additional costs incurred in FY 2013-14 will be 100% covered by State and Federal funding.

Account 7296, Data Processing Services includes a 5% ($1,372) increase based on IT Services rates.

Account 7355, Rents & Leases-Equipment includes a 69% ($1,429) increase based primarily on current year projected copier costs.


Significant Program Changes
Consumer spending directly affects the amount of realignment revenue received. The significant decline in sales tax that started in FY 2007-08 has stabilized in FY 2009-10 and during the last three fiscal years, the sales tax receipts have increased, however no sales tax growth has been included in the recommended budget. Based on statutes, in the years that sales tax receipts exceed prior year base, the funds will be first utilized to fund earned caseload growth within the Social Services account, which are based on statutory calculations performed by the State using realigned program expenditures for each county. Fresno County was paid $6,147,758 in caseload growth during FY 2012-13, which were

earned in FY 2007-08, FY 2008-09, and FY 2009-10. The department did not earn any caseload growth in FY 2010-11 and FY 2011-12 and, based on current projections, does not anticipate earning any calculated caseload growth in FY 2012-13. Any additional Sales Tax collected by the State in FY 2013-14 that is in excess of the adjusted base, will first be utilized to pay counties that had earned caseload growth in fiscal years 2010-11, 2011-12, and 2012-13. Based on this, no Sales Tax caseload growth revenues were included in the recommended budget.


Significant Program Changes
The accounting structure for the Local Revenue Fund 2011 was established for FY 2011-12 through Assembly Bill (AB) 118, ABX1 16, and Senate Bill (SB) 89. The funding structure for FY 2012-13 and subsequent fiscal years was enacted by the California Legislature on June 27, 2012 through SB 1020. On September 25, 2012, your Board, through Agenda Item No. 6, approved the creation of Special Revenue Fund 0271 to implement the accounting structure changes needed to comply with SB 1020. The new and permanent funding structure for the Local Revenue Fund 2011 is organized into two main accounts, the Law Enforcement Services Account and Support Services Account, with seven individual subaccounts and additional special accounts that are separately budgeted under various Orgs under Fund 0271. The FY 2012-13 Adjusted Budget for Fund 0271 reflects two additional months of appropriations and estimated revenues to allow Fund 0271 to meet General Fund realignment accruals for July and August 2012, which were not included in the adopted budget. This was a one-time accounting adjustment needed to establish the normal encumbrance-accrual process for 2011 Realignment revenues. The FY 2013-14 Recommended Budget for Fund 0271 reflects the 12-month projection of Sales Tax and VLF revenues for 2011 Realignment.


Significant Program Changes
Due to the fact that growers now have the enhanced ability to enter pesticide use reports for themselves online or through a third party vendor by using the CalAgPermits System, the pesticide use reporting data entry revenue agreement with California Agriculture Commissioner and Sealers Association will be reduced by 33% ($27,949) as agreed upon by the Commissioners’ Association and the California

Department of Pesticide Regulations.
Salaries and Benefits

Salaries and Benefits, recommended at $8,743,102 represent a 1% increase ($53,567) over the current year. Staffing is recommended at 83 positions, an increase of 6 positions. The increase in staffing will allow the department to increase services in areas that have seen a reduction in the past along with securing State funding based on levels of service provided. The addition of these positions will allow the department to meet requirements of the Department of Pesticide Regulation work plan and provide enforcement of environmental and worker safety violations, thus eliminating the risk of losing significant State revenues for not meeting regulations.
Recommended funding includes:

Account 6100, Regular Salaries increased by 5% ($188,588) due to an increase of six positions over FY 2012-13 Adopted Budget.

Account 6200, Extra-Help decreased by 15% ($106,183) due to decreases in the European Grapevine Moth (EGVM) program and the addition of more full-time staff.

Account 6300, Overtime decreased 4% ($9,000) due to increased staffing levels to provide needed support.

Account 6400, Retirement Contribution increased by 6% ($137,506) due to an increase of six positions.

Account 6500, OASDI increased by 3% ($11,072) due to an increase of six positions.
Services and Supplies

Services and Supplies, recommended at $2,495,141, represent a 1% ($21,109) increase over the FY 2012-13 Adopted Budget primarily due to an increase in material costs used in the Pest and Weed management programs.
Recommended funding includes:

Account 7010, Agriculture represents a 14% increase ($10,627) due to the increase in materials for the Pest Management program.

Account 7011, Agriculture-Weed Killer represents a 14% increase ($10,511) due to an increase in materials for the weed management program.

Account 7296, Data Processing Services represents a 27% increase ($88,081) due to the increased need for information technology staff hours for the development of programs to automate the reporting provided to the State. The initial outlay will be offset by future savings to the number of man hours and costs used to produce these reports.

Account 7415, Trans, Travel, and Education represents a 35% increase ($1,652) primarily due to bi-annual continuing education classes scheduled for FY 2013-14.

Account 7416, Transportation & Travel-County Garage represents a 7% decrease ($83,730), and is a result of the new billing system in Fleet to bill for actual costs.


Significant Program Changes
With continued reduced net County cost allocations, code enforcement efforts will be primarily focused on health and safety code related violations. Neighborhood beautification and land use violations (inappropriate use/activities per Zoning/Williamson Act) would be given secondary priority.
Salaries and Benefits

Salaries and Benefits represent a 5% ($242,038) increase over the FY 2012-13 Adopted Budget due to the addition of four positions and retirement rate increases.

Recommended funding includes:

Forty-five positions in the Development Services division and four positions in the Capital Projects division for a total of 49 positions.
Services and Supplies

Services and Supplies represent a 10% ($217,849) decrease from the FY 2012-13 Adopted Budget.
Recommended funding includes:

An appropriation of $12,000 in net County cost allocation to pay for tourism related activities. These activities are solely to maintain the Blossom and Fruit Trails, along with the related website maintenance, media relations and no-cost marketing cooperatives as time and funding permit.

Appropriations of $194,957 to support ongoing capital projects. These appropriations are fully offset by funded projects.

An appropriation of $215,278 in net County cost for monitoring of closed landfills as mandated by Title 27 of the California Code of Regulations.

An appropriation of $118,440 for the energy maintenance projects for various County buildings. This appropriation is funded by rebates from PG&E.
Other Charges

Other Charges represent a 61% ($23,176) decrease from the FY 2012-13 Adopted Budget.
Recommended funding includes:

Interest payment in the amount of $14,880 for the Blue Hills loan from Risk Management.

Second installment of a three-year loan repayment for a letter of credit in the amount of $489,375 for the Blue Hills Disposal site to demonstrate Financial Assurance for the regulatory approved estimated post closure amount, as required by California Code of Regulations Title 22 § 66264.145. An additional net County cost allocation has been provided for these payments.


Significant Program Changes
Some of the decrease in appropriations is reflective of the completion of contracts on several large, multi-year projects for several phases of Academy Avenue and Manning Avenue (Crawford to Hill). However, much of the overall budget still reflects an allocation of funds for specific Measure “C” and Federal Aid projects that will be awarded for construction or have significant design engineering completed in the coming fiscal years.
The allocation of funding also considered the current unstable prices of oil products, such as asphalt concrete and liquid asphalts, and aggregate materials used in road maintenance and new construction.
Staffing is recommended at 196 positions, a reduction of 2 vacant positions that are being recommended for deletion.
The department continues its team-based approach in seeking to identify avenues for improving service to our clients and other County departments. This is evident in the scheduling of heavy equipment usage by our road maintenance yards so as to promote sharing of the equipment. This venture has allowed us to reduce our heavy equipment fleet by approximately 29% from previous years. This includes working with other jurisdictions on projects of common interest. The use of advanced electronic and computer technology in areas such as Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Cost Accounting Management System (CAMS) are being employed.
Road Maintenance
The FY 2013-14 programs consist of the following components:
Day Labor Rehabilitation, Specific Maintenance Projects, and
Pavement Seals and Maintenance Overlays............................$5.52 Million
Contract Preventive Maintenance ............................................$8.49 Million
Routine Road Maintenance Activities ......................................$9.96 Million

Traffic Signs and Striping .........................................................$1.34 Million
Traffic Safety and Operations ..................................................$1.62 Million
Total ...................................................................................$26.93 Million
A total of $ 5.52 Million is recommended for day labor rehabilitation and specific maintenance projects for roads. These funds will be expended for the rehabilitation of approximately 25 miles of selected lower traffic volume roads by day labor forces. Approximately $300,000 (not included in the $5.52 Million allocation) has been budgeted for maintenance of private roads inthe County Service Areas (CSAs). The CSAs will reimburse the Road Fund for all maintenance work.
The recommended $8.49 Million for contract preventive maintenance projects will provide for the maintenance treatment of approximately 37 miles of slurry seals on residential streets, 25 miles of chip seal projects, and 13 miles of asphalt concrete overlay. The preventive maintenance allocation also reflects $ 1.74 Million of Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality (CMAQ) Shoulder projects throughout the County.
Pothole patching, shoulder maintenance, and other routine road maintenance activities, including culvert maintenance, storm damage repairs, tree trimming, and snow removal are recommended at $ 9.96 million. The allocation of expenditure activity to the various general maintenance categories can vary in any given year. For example, in years when above average precipitation occurs, the cost for snow removal, storm response and signing, and storm damage repairs will consume more of these allocations than in normal years.
Traffic signs and striping, including installation and maintenance of traffic signs, pavement markings, and line striping is recommended at $1.34 million. This allocation includes funding for agreements with Caltrans for Caltrans operated traffic signals at joint State/County intersections at an annual cost of approximately $50,000 and the City of Fresno for the maintenance of County-owned traffic signals and lighting at an annual amount of approximately $130,000 and with a private contractor in the annual amount of $20,000 to maintain a traffic signal and lighting installed by the State on Jayne Avenue in the Coalinga area as a condition of development for the State Hospital facility (traffic volumes entering and leaving the facility warranted a traffic signal on Jayne Avenue and since Jayne Avenue is a County road, the signal became the property of the County).
Included in the $26.93 million allocation in the proposed budget for road maintenance and traffic signs and striping, there is an allocation of $1.62 million for traffic safety and operations activities. This allocation provides for the preparation and review of Traffic Safety Studies to determine the need for four-way stop signs, other traffic control devices, traffic control needs, review and approval of encroachment permits for work to be done within the County road right-of-way, issuance of oversize load permits for County roads, and various other operational and safety roadway related activities. This allocation also includes the Traffic Census (traffic count program) section in the Maintenance and Operations division.

The expansion was required to comply with the fill sequence plan developed by Shaw Environmental & Infrastructure Inc. and for the preparation of the Phase I Reclamation Project (clean closure, removal of waste from the 30 acres of unlined area) and to comply with Title 27 CCR requirements.
Since 2005, the AADS Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB) Waste Discharge Requirements have stated that the County proposes to remove the waste from the unlined portion of the site and place it into a lined area. A notice of violation was issued by the RWQCB in February, 1997 due to volatile organic compounds detected in ground water monitoring wells adjacent to the 30 acres. Additionally the Phase I area resides in the areas of Phase III, Modules 11 & 12.

Significant Program Changes
The Library will implement the new With out Walls (WoW) Mobile Library. Librarians will not be assigned to a physical building, but rather will be assigned to the new WoW Branch. It is essentially a reversal of

the traditional information seeking model: rather than having librarians be passive, waiting for customers to approach them for service, they will take the initiative to connect with various sectors of the community. These staff will go beyond answering that one-time reference question into the active role of a professional who is available to help solve customers’ problems. Services at branches will remain unaffected and there will be a librarian for each cluster typically assigned to the larger regional branch.
