Key Challenges and Outstanding Issues
• Preparing for 2014 and Health Care reform
• Responding to organizational and mandate changes at the federal and state level
• Continuing to restructure services, supports and delivery mechanisms given continuing state and 
federal budget uncertainty
• Balancing immediate decisions and long range planning while engaged in staffing and program 
transitions that impact employee morale and can compromise service delivery
• Identifying and implementing programmatic principles and
evidenced-based strategies and practices that attend to the multiple needs of the underserved and 
vulnerable population in an integrated, cross-divisional land coordinated fashion
• Coordinating and sustaining appropriately paced strategies that grow the integrated service 
capacity of Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHC's) (e.g., alcohol, drug, mental health, and

• Expanding awareness and adoption of the full continuum of prevention to crisis intervention and 
intensive treatment across all divisions while leveraging relationships and strengths of community 
partners
• Creating a more adaptive human resources and classification system to facilitate the flexibility 
and qualifications needed to develop and sustain a workforce capable of meeting the increasing and 
more complicated demands of our diverse constituencies
• Evaluating state's focus on long-term care restructuring and realignment and its impact on 
programs and services to older adults
• Doing succession planning with 24 percent of department workforce likely to retire over the next

• Description: A total of 16.75 FTE positions are proposed for
reduction within the Department of Health & Human Services relating to the loss of State and 
federal revenue in the AB 3632 Children's Mental Health Services and Women & Infant Children's 
programs, as well as an Administration Division early long-term restructuring option including 2.0 
FTE filled positions. A total of $3.15 million in expenditure reductions, offset with a one-time 
credit if $274,000, and $2.3 million in associated revenue adjustments results in a NCC reduction 
of
$564,131. Overall, 4.80 FTE filled and 11.95 vacant positions are recommended for reduction.
A total of 2.80 FTE filled position reductions relating to State and federal revenue losses include 
the following: 1.0 FTE Clinical Psychologist II; 1.00 FTE Licensed Mental Health 
Practitioner/Mental Health Practitioner; and 0.80 FTE Senior Nutritionist. In addition, 2.0 FTE 
filled HHS Fiscal Supervisors
are recommended for reduction relating to the department's Administrative restructuring. A total of 4.80 FTE filled positions
are recommended for reduction.
A total of 11.95 FTE vacant positions are recommended for reduction relating to State and federal 
revenue losses, including the following: 7.15 FTE Licensed Mental Health Practitioner/Mental Health 
Practitioner; 2.50 FTE Licensed Mental Health Practitioner-Bilingual/MHP-Bilingual; 1.30 FTE Mental 
Health Unit Supervisor; 0.50 FTE Accounting Assistant; and 0.50 FTE Office Assistant III.
• Programmatic Impacts of Proposed Changes: Due to the State's realignment of the AB 3632 
Children's Mental Health Services Program mandate to local school districts, the County will need 
to reduce staffing in June. Through a combination of holding positions vacant, as well as attempts 
to reprogram staffing levels toward a new, lower level of service program for basic children's 
mental health services, staff has mitigated reductions in force to the extent possible. Due to the 
state realignment of this mandate, the proposed budget will include the elimination of 11.45 FTE 
vacant and 2.0 FTE filled positions.
A new children's mental health program within our existing baseline budget is recommended for FY 
2012-13. The recommended program will include 1.0 FTE Clinic Psychologist-Bilingual; 3.0 FTE 
Licensed Mental Health Practitioners/Mental Health Practitioners; 1.0 FTE Licensed
Mental Health Practitioners/Mental Health Practitioner-
Bilingual; a 0.50 FTE Mental Health Unit Supervisor; and 0.50 FTE Office Assistant III to comprise 
the continued $750,000 baseline funding. This new program also includes an $80,000 services and 
supplies budget, as well as a $226,000 contract services budget, offset with State revenues for the 
smaller program.
Reductions to the Women, Infant and Children's (WIC) program, based upon federal revenue cuts, 
include an additional 0.80 FTE filled and 0.50 FTE vacant positions to allow the County budget to 
remain balanced.
Restructuring the Administration Division, including the reduction of 2.0 FTE filled HHS Fiscal 
Supervisor positions, would better reflect the changes in HHS services, better support HHS programs 
and clients, and move the department toward a more horizontal management structure. Impacts would 
include improved support to HHS programs and clients, and reduced net county cost. This reduction 
would not contribute to closing the FY 2012-13 budget shortfall, but would represent early ongoing 
savings toward future year shortfalls. The Department would receive a one-time credit for early 
implementation of this reduction option in the amount of
$274,000.

exchange, and
program performance

Working with many formerly paying people who are now out
of work and no longer paying child support or court-ordered
debt due to the economic downturn
The Enhanced Court Collections (ECC) program was
established pursuant to Senate Bill 940, which requires each California Superior Court or county to 
implement a collections program to better enforce payment of various court-ordered fines and fees. 
In FY 2006-07, ECC was created by a memorandum of understanding with the courts to provide 
collection services for delinquent fines. ECC collects delinquent fines and fees then forwards them 
to the courts for distribution to the county and other jurisdictions. The ECC program is under the 
administrative oversight of the
Department of Child Support Services.
The Department of Child Support Services (DCSS) operates
under Title IV-D of the Social Security Act and is funded by federal and state funds. The 
department's operations are
governed by federal and state regulations and include
establishing paternity, establishing child and medical support orders, modifying existing support 
orders and enforcing support orders. The department's current workload includes
approximately 3,300 open child support cases.

Story Behind Performance:
Local Child Support agencies are scored individually and comparatively across the state based on 
key federal performance measurements. In fiscal year 2010-11 Marin County Department of Child 
Support Services showed major improvements in these key factors. This fiscal year the program moved 
from being ranked as the eighth highest performing program in the State to being the second highest 
performing program in the State. Staff dedication to strategic performance targets, improved 
business process flows, and caseload stratification all contributed to this increase in overall 
program performance for fiscal year 2010-11.

FY 2012-13 Initiatives
• In collaboration with both the Juvenile Justice Delinquency Prevention Commission and the San 
Rafael Unified School district, the Probation Department is developing the foundation for the use 
of restorative justice practices in the community


Key Challenges and Outstanding Issues
• In FY 2012-13, the primary challenge facing the Probation Department will be the development and 
implementation of “Public Safety Realignment,” also known as Assembly Bill
109. The Board of Supervisors approved a plan to implement the law in September 2011. However some 
of the most difficult responsibilities associated with this legislation still lie ahead.
- Developing partnerships among both County and
community-based agencies that will serve this new population
- Determining the size and complexity of the caseloads of offenders that will require supervision
- Creating the capacity to assure community safety through hiring of new staff, and creating 
measurements of success and the means to track them
- Balance increasing the capacity in order to meet the requirements of the AB109 during a time of 
budget reductions for all other services and programs
• The ongoing growth and change of staff in the organization. Approximately 40% of the staff in the 
Department has less than 10 years of experience, and 84% of the management team has less than 5 
years of experience in their present classification. This is a substantial change from 10 years 
ago, when the average tenure for both all employees and managers was much longer. These substantial 
changes in staffing are occurring at the same time as other significant shifts, including:
- Greater emphasis in field work, and coordinating supervision of offenders with law enforcement 
agencies
- Increased use of technology in every aspect of the department's  operations
- Reliance on data to drive decisions
- Referring to research to support practices and interventions
• The Department is keenly aware of the need for succession planning, and therefore allocates a 
significant amount of resources towards training in both individual staff and organizational 
development. The Probation Department believes strongly that by investing in staff development we 
will improve outcomes in the short term, and ensure long- term success in the organization by 
preparing its future
leaders.

healthy work environment

FY 2012-13 Initiatives

Thrive and Wellness Initiatives


• Description: The Department proposes to eliminate 2.00 FTE
vacant positions (1.0 FTE Legal Secretary II and 1.0 FTE Deputy Public Defender IV), and to add 
1.75 FTE positions (1.0 FTE Legal Process Assistant-Bilingual II; 0.50 Legal Assistant; and
0.25 FTE Deputy Public Defender II). In addition, the Department intends to proceed with some 
promotional opportunities next year for legal processing support staff.
The Public Defender would receive a one-time credit in FY 2012-13 for this early implementation 
effort in the amount of
$169,000. Similar to the HHS Administrative Division early LTR option, it would not contribute to 
closing the FY 2012-13 budget shortfall. But it would represent early ongoing savings toward future 
year shortfalls.
• Programmatic Impacts of Proposed Changes: The restructuring will allow improved leadership, 
responsibility and accountability for the organization with no adverse impacts to
other departments or client services.

• Meeting the needs of external customers and court
coverage demands with reduced staff
• Ability to maintain effectiveness of all therapeutic courts

• In order to address the above issues, the department is utilizing a number of contingent 
workforce resources (temporary staff) to take on short-term projects and relieve the pressures on 
the existing team. The department's primary strategy is to focus on the Workforce Strategic Plan

as timely a manner as possible -- but the timing of its
execution is beyond the control of the LTF.

of individual complaints, especially juveniles, particularly in view of
California Law governing the same in the judicial context

www.marinlawlibrary.com, with the objective of making the web site a major vehicle for providing

Key Challenges and Outstanding Issues
• The principal and continuing challenge faced by the Marin County Law Library is to restructure 
its operations so that the needs of the general public are placed on an equal footing with those of 
legal professionals
• As with all California county law libraries, Marin has, for more than a decade, experienced a 
steady rise in the number of non-attorneys availing themselves of its resources and services, 
however, these patrons arrive with only marginal familiarity with the law and, as a result require 
a great deal more time and attention from the library staff than would be typical when the staff is 
assisting legal professionals
• Given the above mentioned challenges, staff development has become a major priority and there is 
a pressing need for additional staff at the Marin County Law Library and for staff members with 
broad professional capabilities ranging from personal “people skills” to abilities to conduct 
sophisticated
legal and informational research on the internet

• Provide feedback to the County through assessment of issues facing county contractors and 
community service needs


Key Challenges and Outstanding Issues
• The severe reduction in health services by the California state budget process has put the 
Department of Health and Human Services in a triage mode, the Mental Health Board continues to 
assist the department in thinking of innovative ways to address the deficiencies
• Marin County is a relatively privileged community as evidenced by recent state-wide studies and a 
recent study by the Marin Community Foundation, this tends to make the community less tolerant of 
diversity and unable to recognize the silent and sometimes invisible minority of Marin County 
residents who are not getting adequate health care services. As the report concludes, “the quality 
of public services tends to decrease when society's most powerful people 'opt out' by, for 
instance, sending their children to private schools, seeking boutique health care, and providing 
their own public safety services behind the gates of private-enclave communities. Marin has the 
second-highest level of income inequality of any California county…” A Portrait of Marin, p. 31.
• The Department of Health and Human Services is undergoing three major challenges at the moment: 
1) the merger of mental health and substance/alcohol abuse treatment; 2) the loss of a long-time 
director of mental health services, and 3) severe budget cuts to STAR Court, AB 3632 services, and 
other mental health services in general and as a volunteer board, the Mental Health Board can only 
assist to the extent the Department of Health and Human Services has the capacity and the 
willingness to engage our volunteer board

achieving the goals listed above and supporting at least a part-time staff person to coordinate 
Marin County Youth Commission activities.
