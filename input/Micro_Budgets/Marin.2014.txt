•
While the actual number of burglaries in the County remains essentially unchanged from historical levels, the brazen actions of burglars have changed dramatically. In the past, burglars in Marin have generally targeted homes known to be unoccupied. Recently, however, the department has experienced an increased number of burglaries that occurred while the residents were home or who arrived home during the commission of the crimes. Multiple arrests have been made in connection with the cases; in some cases, the same suspects have been arrested two or three times. The challenge faced by the department is keeping the subjects in custody until prosecuted and doing what it can to alter their choices to commit crimes or prevent them from victimizing others.

Key Challenges and Outstanding Issues
•
Completing a $60 billion assessment roll and completing very demanding workloads in the Assessor, Recorder, and County Clerk with limited resources is an annual challenge. The work is increasingly complex and requires the dedication and commitment of all resources. The impact of the 2007 economy resulted in downturn of the real estate market, volatility, and, more recently, recovery. Not since the passage of Proposition 13 have flexibility and responsiveness been more necessary. Implementation of regular, on-going technological improvements improve efficiencies and service levels in addition to conventional, innovative, and planning approaches.
•
New requirements in regulatory, legal, economic, and service expectations raise performance requirements each year. Compounding this affect, it is anticipated that all areas of the office will also experience increased workload volume in the next one to two years. Adapting to the changing demands has been, and will continue to be, a department priority.
•
Technology needs and advancements will continue as a challenge and a priority. Our community appreciates levels of service for Marin County comparable to those of large urban counties. Without large county budget opportunities, it is necessary that continuity of good planning, innovation, and application of resources will be necessary management
 strategies. In a small county, increasing mutual collaboration with other departments, as well as public and private sectors, can lead to improved efficiencies.
•
Consistent development of a culture of high values, performance, and stewardship is an enduring conviction of the department. Over the next one to five years, our department expects a number of retirements from key positions throughout the department. We take succession planning and stewardship seriously and we see the foundations we are setting now to provide a mechanism for successful on-going work processes. In this process, we engage with input and feedback from staff, interdepartmental experts, leadership mentors, professional level colleagues, and academic resources

GOAL V
Enhance revenue opportunities for the department
Initiatives
•
Develop new sources of revenue through outreach to other special districts for general law advice, employment law services, and litigation work
Difficult land use issues are being faced by the County, which have resulted in contentious confrontations at Board of Supervisors meetings as well as the need for the department to educate Supervisors on the legal issues involved
•
An increase of Public Records Act (PRA) requests from the public has necessitated departmental attorneys to devote an inordinate amount of time to unreimbursed services. Marin County Counsel, unlike most County Counsel offices, has organized the PRA requests and removed the burden from departments. The department is still developing efficiency methods to handle the large number of requests along with the reliance of other departments on County Counsel to provide significant assistance.
•
An increase in the court's caseload for the child welfare program has resulted in a second weekly calendar for the Child Protective Services/Juvenile calendar. This has resulted in a significant increase (of at least 20 percent) in the work for designated deputy county counsels.
•
The expansion of special district services has begun to tax the resources of the department. While the expected increase in revenue is welcome, the department is cognizant that the increased workload will burden attorneys. It is estimated that the increased workload could equal 40 to 50 percent of one attorney position; while opinions might be absorbed through efficiency measures, actual litigation - whether it be tort or employment law defense - will
contribute to the increased workload.
•
Assessment Appeals Board (AAB) requests for additional legal support: The AAB has made a new request to have an attorney present at hearings where an appellant has requested findings of fact. This request will entail an AAB attorney being present where no such presence was previously required. Since the AABs meet once per month or more, this could create a burden of seven percent of an attorney position.
•
Best Practices within Health and Human Services (HHS): With the HHS Chief Assistant Director's departure and reorganization with several new key people at HHS, the department has determined that it will be necessary to assist HHS in a significant way to identify problem areas and implement best practices. It is estimated that the increase in workload from this endeavor is 10 percent of one attorney position. In addition, HHS has increasingly requested County Counsel involvement in an area called “Fair Hearings”. Prior to this new request, the department was not involved in the Fair Hearings, which requires an attorney to provide legal assistance and advocacy at the hearings. At this juncture, it is unknown what the actual burden will be.
•
The loss of two long-standing County Counsel III attorneys and one County Counsel IV attorney, as well as the subsequent hiring and training of new attorneys to replace their key positions, also poses a challenge.

•
ADA compliance, with regard to all of the documentation the department strives to publish for the public's benefit, has created a significant cost and workload challenge.

Key Challenges and Outstanding Issues
•
The economic recovery has resulted in a gradual but steady increase in construction permitting activity for the past two years. The Agency has responded by initiating efforts to fill staff positions left vacant between 2008 and 2012 to meet the Agency's net county cost reduction targets. The length of time required to fill vacancies has created a temporary challenge in the Agency's ability to deliver timely service and maintain high customer service satisfaction levels in the permitting programs.
•
The County is required under State law to adopt the next Housing Element (2014-2022 cycle) no later than January 31, 2015. Failure to meet this deadline would result in negative consequences to the County. Although the state-mandated requirement to plan for housing (Regional Housing Needs Allocation) has dropped substantially for the County, the nature and amount of work associated with completing a housing element update will be challenging in light of the above deadline.
•
Implementation of the new automated permit tracking system (COMET) continues to place demands on staff with respect to training and integration of new business processes as well as time to assist with system design and testing. These remain challenges as the implementation of the permit tracking system expands from the Environmental Health Services program to the Building and Safety and Planning programs.
•
The implementation of the County's Analysis of Impediments to Fair Housing Choice (AI) has been a high priority initiative since the AI's adoption in October 2011. While the County has made steady progress on this front, the recent departure of the Agency's Fair Housing Program Coordinator is expected to reduce the rate of continued implementation
until the position is filled.
•
The 2007 update of the Countywide Plan contains over 400 programs, a number of which involve work products from the Agency to implement policies according to a predetermined schedule. Due to the ambitious nature of the Countywide
Plan's implementation schedule, the Agency will not be able to implement all programs according to their respective time frames for completing work. Staff will therefore be recommending adjustments to the implementation schedule in Fiscal Year 2014-15 based on a contemporary and more realistic assessment of the Agency's workload capacity.

•
Fulfill all Measure A reporting requirements, including release of the first Measure A Annual Report, and continue active reporting to promote transparency
Key Challenges and Outstanding Issues
•
The current park entry fee structure is a disincentive to park visitation, especially for low-income individuals and families. The department is exploring strategic fee reductions as a means to encourage increased park visitation, while attempting to minimize impacts on park revenues.
•
Communications and outreach in many forms are vital to park agencies; by these, the general public can be made aware of the many opportunities and benefits offered by agencies' lands, programs and services. Similarly, well-designed parks are the result of design and planning by professionals such as landscape architects. Unlike in prior years, the FY 2014-15 Marin County Parks budget reflects its true share of the department's communications and landscape architecture expenditures. Previously, the Open Space District had borne nearly the entire cost of the department's communications, and to a lesser extent, landscape architecture expenditures. These expenditures cannot be supported by Measure A, so they are now being funded in the department's budget. Because the budget could not absorb these additional necessary expenditures, an equal amount of basic park operating expenditures were shifted to the Measure A budget.
•
Many Community Service Areas (CSAs) supported by the department have inadequate funding to renovate or replace deteriorating facilities such as bridges, swimming pools, and tennis courts. Funding is sufficient only for maintenance, and maintenance can only go so far to remedy the problems with these aging facilities. Given the many needs competing for funding from the Measure A Parks and Open Space Program, Measure A cannot support the full cost of replacing and renovating these facilities. CSAs should be urged to explore raising locally generated revenues, either through assessments or special taxes, to undertake such major improvements as, for example, CSA 14 has done.

Key Challenges and Outstanding Issues
•
Competing state and federal guidance and programs
•
Reduced local funding, reduced grant availability, and reduced staff time in key public agencies
•
Due to the fact that major disasters happen rarely and sometimes not at all in a given lifetime, a key challenge is overcoming economic, political, and social pressures on individuals and families that are distracting and result in a lack of long-term preparedness efforts and an appearance of apathy towards spending time, money, and effort in preparing themselves and their communities
•
No single government department or specialized public service agency can provide the County with a comprehensive preparedness/response capability that will preserve lives, homes, and the community in the event of a major or regional disaster; as such, preparedness efforts from multiple County agencies can oftentimes overlap, and would benefit in both effectiveness and efficiency from a greater degree of coordination

Initiatives
•
Review annual Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR), annual Single Audit Report, and annual Management Report for FY 2013-14, and make recommendations to the Board of Supervisors
Key Challenges and Outstanding Issues
•
To ensure that the committee can provide oversight on the County's financial management, the committee must stay current on changing reporting regulations.

Key Challenges and Outstanding Issues
•
While recruitment of commissioners from Novato, Marin City, and West Marin has improved, it continues to be a challenge
•
The commission continues to be understaffed and lacking in resources
•
Youth-friendly forums to express relevant issues are rare. The commission hopes to continue to host larger gatherings that allow youth to come together and learn from each other, but needs the resources and funding to do so.
•
The commission went out into communities more than ever this past year, connecting with youth in Marin City, the Canal District of San Rafael, Novato, and West Marin. The commission needs additional support to continue this trend. This outreach not only allowed commissioners to connect and hear first-hand from their constituents, but it also opened the door for new partners and alliances to emerge. The commission hopes to keep that momentum going, but increased funding is critical in order to keep things moving in the right direction.
•
The commission's meeting location does not have the most convenient access in the evenings and on weekends, particularly when coming from the southern end of the County or West Marin; a more central location, such as the Civic Center, would greatly mitigate this challenge
•
Transportation overall continues to adversely impact the commission's meetings and travel throughout the County. The Youth Leadership Institute routinely uses personal vehicles and time in order to transport commissioners from place to place; bus passes, a vehicle (van or bus), or other support would significantly mitigate this issue and add to the efficiency and effectiveness of the commission.
