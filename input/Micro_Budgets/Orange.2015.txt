The base budget includes a $4.2 million NCC reduction compared
to the FY 2014-15 Modified Budget.
The Orange County District Attorney's Office (OCDA) continues
its cost saving measures by deferring and reducing
expenses in services, supplies, and equipment, and eliminating
non-essential travel and training. As a result, the NCC
request for FY 15-16 is $4.4 million lower than the 2014
SFP's NCC request for FY 2015-16.
The FY 2015-16 Budget, with augmentation request, represents
continued operation at the FY 2014-15 level of staffing.
To meet the FY 2015-16 NCC limit, the OCDA submitted one
augmentation request of $6.9 million to reduce approximately
51 positions including Deputy District Attorneys and
Investigators responsible for prosecuting murderers, rapists,
child molesters, child abusers, spouse abusers, and other felons
to meet basic prosecution. The operations of the OCDA
are integrated and interdependent. A restore augmentation
of $6.9M is requested to fund 51 existing positions vital to
upholding public safety and to effectively represent the People
of the State of California and provide Orange County residents
and visitors with a safe community.
Each year prosecutors review approximately 70,000
crime reports and file cases involving over 60,000
defendants. To avoid significant increases to the base
budget, the OCDA continues cost cutting measures by
deferring and reducing expenses in services, supplies,
and equipment, and eliminating non-essential travel
and training.
¦ The advance of DNA technology is bringing an unprecedented
number of cold hit DNA cases into the criminal
justice system. These cold hits often identify violent
offenders and may implicate statute of limitations so
that immediate attention is paramount for public safety.
As DNA technology expands, the number of perpetrators
identified by DNA cold hits will continue to
increase.
¦ Continue to evaluate staffing levels to ensure sufficient
resources are available to address both the volume and
complexity of caseloads. Caseload demands are managed
through staff rotations and in some instances use
of volunteer staff.
¦ Continue to exercise fiscal prudence and closely monitor
revenues and expenses. The FY 2015-16 budget
includes a transfer out of the District Attorney's entire
estimated Obligated Fund Balance for Fund 14J, Excess
Public Safety Sales Tax, or $4.2 million to fund existing
operations.
¦ Continue to work collaboratively with CEO/Budget
Office and highlight variances and issues, which may
impact budget requirements.
¦ Work collaboratively with CEO/Budget Office and the
Auditor-Controller to complete the transition of Board
directed consolidation of the Office of the Public
Administrator with the Office of the District Attorney.
The base budget includes increased appropriations due to
organizational changes implemented with the recent consolidation
of the PA with the DA including position transfers
from Health Care Agency-Public Guardian. A reduce augmentation
in the amount of $1.2 million is included to meet
the NCC limit, of which the DA-PA has requested full restoration.
Significant reduction in multi-year backlog of uncompleted
estates.
¦ Increased early completion of auctioning personal and
real property.
¦ Countywide regional training on PA matters.
FY 2015-16 Requested Budget for Grand Jury services
include $528,612 Appropriations and Net County Cost,
which is $19,063 more than FY 2014-15 final budget of
$509,549. An increase in Grand Jury budget is due to 3%
increase in Net County Cost Limits.
FY 2015-16 $528,612 Budget include:
1. $314,000 for reimbursement of mileage claims and
stipend (per diem) for Grand Jury members
2. $164,000 for reimbursement of Grand Jury administrative
support cost to OC Superior Court
3. $48,465 for County Information Technology cost for
Grand Jury members
4. $2,147 for workers' comp cost allocation for Grand
Jury members
FY 2015-16 Recommended Budget for Juvenile Justice Commission
services include $176,601 Appropriations and Net
County Cost, which is $5,144 (3%) more than FY 2014-15
final budget of $171,457.
FY 2015-16 Recommended Budget for Detention Release
services includes $1,665,931 Appropriations and $1,655,931
Net County Cost, which is $48,231 (3%) more than FY 2014-
15 final budget of $1,607,700. The OC Superior Court provides
administrative support to Detention Release and
receives reimbursement from the County.
In order to meet the Net County Cost limit, Probation
increased its budgeted vacancy rate by approximately 2% in
FY 2015-16. Carrying a vacancy rate of this level is only possible
due to the historically low population levels in the
Department's juvenile institutions. Probation will be reviewing
the possibility of deleting long-term vacant positions
within the Department's juvenile detention and commitment
facilities, which will decrease the overall Departmental
vacancy rate.
Probation continues to focus on the efficient and effective
use of staff resources by reviewing the deployment
of existing resources. Performance Metrics and Evidence-
Based Practice initiatives are being used in this
effort.
¦ The Department continues to manage with limited
resources to protect public safety, as well as the health
and security of juveniles in custody.
¦ Probation will continue its joint efforts with the Courts,
other County departments, and community law
enforcement and stakeholders, especially as it relates to
Criminal Justice Realignment activities.
Probation continues to make priority improvements to
its infrastructure to increase efficiency, while striving
for data sharing compatibility with state, county, and
local agencies.
¦ The Department continues to look for grant opportunities
to help fund needed department-wide services consistent
with its use of best practices.
¦ Probation and other criminal justice partners are
addressing the impacts of Proposition 47 by monitoring
caseloads and shifting staff resources as appropriate.
To meet the FY 2015-16 Net County Cost limit, the Public
Defender submitted a reduce augmentation in the amount of
$1,642,733 requiring the deletion of 18 positions. As the
Public Defender budget is comprised of approximately 85%
salaries and benefits, it is likely that any reductions to the
base budget would result in staff reductions and the Department
would have to begin reducing caseloads, potentially
becoming unavailable on as many as 4,020 cases. In order to
maintain current levels of service, the Public Defender submitted
an augmentation request to restore $1,642,733 and all
18 positions.
The Offices of the Public Defender continue to provide
quality services on a projected 78,772 cases per year
and is proactive in addressing workload impacts resulting
from the complexity of casework, Proposition 47,
realignment, revocation hearings, parole violation hearings,
the three strikes law, changes in Proposition 36,
changes in how some juvenile offenders are prosecuted,
expansion of attorney responsibilities in delinquency
matters, expanded filing of "cold cases" arising from
advances in the use of DNA evidence and other impacts
of the evolving legal environment.
¦ Proposition 47, which was approved by the voters in
November 2014, allows many nonserious and nonviolent
drug and property crimes to be reduced from felonies
to misdemeanors. This includes individuals who
have been previously sentenced and are still incarcerated
as well as individuals who have been released. This
has resulted in a substantial increase in the number of
cases for the Offices of the Public Defender.
¦ The Offices of the Public Defender, in partnership with
the Community Corrections Partnership and other
County Departments, continue to evaluate and employ
best practices to ensure the continued successful implementation
of services required as a result of AB109.
The base budget includes a $3.4 million Net County Cost
(NCC) increase compared to the FY 2014-15 Modified Budget
which includes a three percent growth increase of $2.2
million, a decrease in one-time NCC of $11.8 Million and a
$13 million increase for the transfer of NCC from Orange
County Public Works to accommodate the charges for utilities,
records management and parking fees. The base budget
includes a $23.8 million reduce augmentation to meet the
NCC limit, which the Sheriff's Department has requested full
restoration.
Prop 172 Public Safety Sales Tax Revenue (Prop 172)
remains a significant funding source for the Sheriff's
Department, but fluctuated with the economy and
declined significantly in the past years. Although Prop
172 revenue has experienced growth, it is not significant
enough to offset the ongoing operational cost
increases in the areas of salaries and employee Benefits,
Workers' Compensation Insurance, Property and Liability
Insurance, fuel, food and other services and supplies.
¦ In response to overall operational cost increases and the
decline in State and Federal grants as well as other revenues,
the department is focused on reducing the budget
without impacting public safety. One of the measures has been to delay filling vacant positions in order to save
costs. In addition, the department reduced/deferred
facility maintenance and equipment purchases.
¦ The Department faces a fluctuating jail population
which may impact revenues. The passage of Proposition
47 has reduced the inmate population; however, those
same convicts may be re-incarcerated as they miss
court dates and fail to pay citations. The AB109 population
has decreased with the passage of Prop 47 due to
the reclassification of inmates and ICE beds continue to
fluctuate.
FY 15-16 includes re-budgeting of grants and use of obligated
fund balance.
Orange County and Southern California continue to be
the pipeline for Major Drug Trafficking Organizations
(MDTO's) bringing their methamphetamine into the
United States. Once in the Southern California area, the
methamphetamine is often cleaned with a process
called "icing" which involves the washing of drugs with
solvent, which allows it to be sold at a higher price. The
presence of methamphetamine manufacturing labs in
Southern California has dropped; however, the team
continues to encounter these "icing" labs in and around
Orange County. The drug cartels have moved some of
their production into Mexico where they have more
access to the precursor chemicals needed for production
and less of a presence from law enforcement.
¦ During 2014, the PROACT continued to focus on disrupting
drug trafficking organizations in the facilitation,
manufacturing and distribution of
methamphetamine. Since the aggressive movement of
production to Mexico, the PROACT has experienced a
shift in trend from production to smuggling. The PROACT
continues to identify laboratories throughout the
region as well as the identification of leads related to the
transportation of methamphetamine in liquid form.
¦ In addition to Methamphetamine, Orange County is
also experiencing an increase in the use of hash/honey
oil, as well as an increase in butane honey oil extraction
labs. This new designer drug is a new focus of law
enforcement agencies within the boundaries of Orange
County. As a result, law enforcement incidents include
buy/bust operations, enforcement investigations, clandestine
methamphetamine and butane honey oil laboratories
and search warrants.
The County Automated Fingerprint Identification Fund is a
self-balancing budget with restrictive revenue from Court
Fines. The base budget for Fiscal Year 2015-16 includes a
$954,616 transfer in from Fund 14D to fund operational
costs in Fund 109 when revenue is insufficient to offset the
expenditures for that year.
The trend continues to shift from traditional fingerprint
identification databases to multi-modal biometric identification
systems, capable of storing several types of
physical features for identification. Fingerprints, facial
images, iris patterns and voice patterns are among the
biometric modalities being considered by local law
enforcement to maximize the ability to identify criminals.
¦ The inability for disparate local, state, national and
international identification systems to communicate
with one another is no longer a permanent obstacle.
The momentum is in the direction of interoperability,
being able to search an unlike system and allowing
unlike systems to search our local data.
¦ These trends will impact the Cal-ID operation and will
result in more technically skilled staff with more diverse
skill sets.
The RNSP-DOJ fund is a self-balancing fund with restricted
revenue from the U.S. Department of Justice. This budget is
intended to fund the RNSP programs and operational costs,
and to reimburse overtime costs worked by participating
agencies. The FY 2015-16 Budget is lower than the FY 14-15
year-end projections, as a result of fund balance transfers to
two newly established funds, Fund 125 (RNSP Department
of Treasury) and Fund 126 (RNSP Other).
RNSP continues to maintain a key role in targeting
major drug trafficking and money laundering organizations
throughout the region. As these organizations
continue to use Orange County as a major thoroughfare
for their transportation and trafficking activities,
RNSP's continued status as an active initiative of the
Los Angeles High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area
(HIDTA), provides the Program access to the critical
intelligence necessary to maintain the innovative and
far reaching approach carried throughout many of its
active investigations.
¦ Mexican drug trafficking organizations continue to be
the primary large-scale drug traffickers in the Southern
California Region. As a result, there has been no change
to the violence experienced along the southwest border
area of Mexico, while the different cartels compete to
control the drug trafficking routes into the United
States. This violence has a direct impact on the domestic
market. In addition, RNSP experienced a significant
increase in the amount and type of weapons seized.
Drug trafficking organizations continue to use not only
land routes to smuggle their drugs into the United
States, but cross border tunnels and air routes to
include ultra-light aircrafts. As the violence in Mexico
lingers, RNSP also continues to experience resistance
from drug/money couriers as well as the persistent shift to female drivers/couriers as well as Caucasian distributors
in an effort to deceive border patrol and local surveillance
teams. In addition, RNSP is seeing a decrease
in the availability of low grade marijuana. Intelligence
sources have indicated that this is due to the shift from
marijuana fields to poppy fields in Mexico in order to
increase the production of heroin.
¦ RNSP continues to experience an increase in money
laundering investigations, and as a result, RNSP continues
to target and impact both narcotic and money laundering
organizations throughout the Southern
California area.
The RNSP - Department of Treasury fund is a newly established
self-balancing fund with restricted revenue from the
U.S. Department of Treasury. This budget is intended to fund
the RNSP programs and operational costs and to manage

The SNP-Department of Treasury fund is a newly established
self-balancing fund with restricted revenue from the
U.S. Department of Treasury. This budget is intended to fund
services and supplies and equipment related to narcotics law
enforcement activities.
In 2014, the Sheriff's Narcotics Program continued to
see an increase in the demand for marijuana. This
demand was apparent through the high number of
indoor and outdoor marijuana growing investigations,
and in the sustained rise of both marijuana and marijuana
currency seizures through both parcel and airport
interdictions. The investigation of indoor marijuana
growing operations creates dangerous hazards to law
enforcement personnel. During these investigations, the
risk of fire, electrocution, carbon dioxide and the exposure
to mold poses the greatest threats to law enforcement
personnel.
¦ The Sheriff's Narcotics Program has encountered midlevel
drug dealers using vehicles to stash their narcotics
as opposed to their residences, storage facilities and/or
stash pads. The dealers move their stash vehicles frequently,
making finding the vehicles difficult. In addition,
narcotics traffickers are becoming more aware that
law enforcement officers are using GPS trackers to monitor
their movements. Narcotics traffickers regularly
check the undercarriage of their vehicles for GPS trackers
installed by law enforcement. Furthermore, some
narcotics traffickers have utilized counter-surveillance
devices that can detect trackers.
¦ Another substantial trend, and of significant concern to
the safety of law enforcement personnel, is the continued
increase in the amount of drug dealers and narcotics
traffickers in possession of firearms. The number of
firearms seized in 2013 was 55, nearly double the number
seized in 2012. In 2014, the Sheriff's Narcotics Program
seized 69 firearms, a 25% increase. The reason for
the increase in firearms is not known, but could possibly
be due to the Sheriff's Narcotics Program's greater
efforts in targeting mid-level narcotics traffickers.
¦ In the airport interdiction realm, smugglers of narcotics
proceeds are carrying smaller amounts of cash in order
to avoid detection. Drug trafficking organizations are
using more than one person on the same flight to smuggle
narcotics proceeds, by either splitting the cash into
multiple bags or by using a lay-off person to distract law
enforcement from the actual smuggler. Also, drug trafficking
organizations are using commercial airlines and parcel carriers, such as USPS, UPS, FedEx and independent
freight carriers to transport large amounts of currency
and narcotics.
¦ In the parcel interdiction arena, drug trafficking organizations
continue to utilize parcels to send narcotics to
states east of California and narcotics proceeds from
eastern states to California. Many parcels are gift
wrapped and currency is often concealed with other
items, such as electronics, clothing, magazines and carbon
paper. The trafficking organizations are using vacuum
sealed bags, distracting odors and gluing the
seams of the parcels to avoid detection.
¦ The continued partnerships with the United States
Postal Service, the United Parcel Service, the Department
of Homeland Security, the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, the Drug Enforcement Agency, and the
Santa Ana Police Department, have been successful in
the interdiction of narcotics and narcotics proceeds
through parcel, freight and mass transit carriers. The
Sheriff s Narcotics Program has significantly increased
narcotic and narcotic currency seizures at the John
Wayne Airport and United States Postal Service through
increased enforcement efforts.
¦ Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) extraction labs continue
to operate in the County. Due to the volatility of the
chemicals used in THC extraction, THC labs pose a substantial
threat to the suspects, the public and law
enforcement. An explosion at a THC lab in Dana Point
in 2013 resulted in the destruction of one home, significant
damage to a neighboring home and the death of
one suspect.
¦ Methamphetamine and heroin prices continue to stay
low, indicating there is an abundant supply. The
increase in prescription narcotics use and heroin use
among young adults and teenagers continues to be a
significant trend in the County. The number of overdoses
and overdose deaths, especially among young
adults and teens, is especially alarming. The abuse of
these two drugs is usually intertwined. The user's
dependence on prescription narcotics often changes to
heroin. Heroin is considerably cheaper than prescription
narcotics, easily accessible and more socially
accepted than in years past. The Sheriff's Narcotics Program
has increased the number of investigations
regarding prescription narcotics and heroin sales. In
2014, the Sheriff's Narcotics Program seized 20% more
heroin than in calendar year 2013.
The Sheriff's Narcotics Program - Department of Justice
(SNP-DOJ) fund is a self-balancing fund with restricted revenue

damage to a neighboring home and the death of
one suspect.
¦ Methamphetamine and heroin prices continue to stay
low, indicating there is an abundant supply. The
increase in prescription narcotics use and heroin use
among young adults and teenagers continues to be a
significant trend in the County. The number of overdoses
and overdose deaths, especially among young
adults and teens, is especially alarming. The abuse of
these two drugs is usually intertwined. The user's
dependence on prescription narcotics often changes to
heroin. Heroin is considerably cheaper than prescription
narcotics, easily accessible and more socially
accepted than in years past. The Sheriff s Narcotics Program
has increased the number of investigations
regarding prescription narcotics and heroin sales. In
2014, the Sheriff's Narcotics Program seized 20% more
heroin than in calendar year 2013.
The Orange County Jail Fund is a self-balancing fund with
restricted revenue. This budget is intended to assist in jail
operational costs. Annually, it reimburses Sheriff-Coroner to
partially offset positions added in 1989 for expansion of the
Theo Lacy Branch Jail and, when additional funds are available,
it reimburses one-time jail expenditures. FY 2015-16
Base Budget includes a transfer out of $750,000 to Sheriff-
Coroner.
The SNP-CALMMET DOJ fund is a newly established selfbalancing
fund with restricted revenue. This budget is
intended to fund services and supplies and equipment
related to CALMMET activities.
The Sheriff's Narcotics Program has encountered midlevel
methamphetamine dealers using vehicles to stash
their narcotics as opposed to their residences, storage
facilities and/or stash pads. The dealers move their
stash vehicles frequently, making finding the vehicles
difficult. In addition, narcotics traffickers are becoming
more aware that law enforcement officers are using GPS
trackers to monitor their movements. Methamphetamine
traffickers regularly check the undercarriage of
their vehicles for GPS trackers installed by law enforcement.
Furthermore, some narcotics traffickers have utilized
counter-surveillance devices that can detect
trackers.
¦ The Highway Interdiction Team has seen an increase in
drug trafficking organizations utilizing hard-wire trackers
concealed in their load vehicles. The trackers discovered
were operating when they were located. Some of
the seized trackers appeared to have microphone capabilities
which allow the drug trafficking organizations to
listen in on the load driver's cell phone and other conversations.
¦ The Highway Interdiction Team has seen an increase in
the size of narcotics loads inside vehicles being transported
from Mexico into the United States. At the same
time, the Highway Interdiction Team has seen smaller
loads of narcotics proceeds traveling southbound into
Mexico. In addition, more methamphetamine traffickers
are transferring money to Mexico via Western Union
and other wire services, as opposed to sending bulk
currency loads to Mexico inside vehicles.
¦ Another substantial trend, and of significant concern to
the safety of law enforcement personnel, is the continued
increase in the amount of drug dealers and narcotics
traffickers in possession of firearms. The number of
firearms seized in 2013 was 55, nearly double the number
seized in 2012. In 2014, the Sheriff's Narcotics Program
seized 69 firearms, a 25% increase. The increase
in firearms is not known, but could possibly be due to
the Sheriff's Narcotics Program's greater efforts in targeting
mid-level narcotics traffickers.
¦ In the airport interdiction realm, smugglers of narcotics
proceeds are carrying smaller amounts of cash in order
to avoid detection. Drug trafficking organizations are
using more than one person on the same flight to smuggle
narcotics proceeds, by either splitting the cash into
multiple bags or by using a lay-off person to distract law
enforcement from the actual smuggler. Also, drug trafficking
organizations are using commercial airlines and
parcel carriers, such as USPS, UPS, FedEx and independent
freight carriers to transport large amounts of currency
and narcotics.
¦ In the parcel interdiction arena, drug trafficking organizations
continue to utilize parcels to send narcotics to
states east of California and narcotics proceeds from
eastern states to California. Many parcels are gift
wrapped and currency is often concealed with other
items, such as electronics, clothing, magazines and carbon
paper. The trafficking organizations are using vacuum
sealed bags, distracting odors and gluing the
seams of the parcels to avoid detection.
¦ The continued partnerships with the United States
Postal Service, the United Parcel Service, the Department
of Homeland Security, the Drug Enforcement Agency and the Santa Ana Police Department, have
been successful in the interdiction of methamphetamine
and narcotics proceeds through highway interdiction
and parcel, freight and mass transit carriers.
The Sheriff's Narcotics Program has seen a significant
increase in methamphetamine and narcotic currency
seizures. In 2014, the Sheriff's Narcotics Program seized
369 pounds of methamphetamine (an increase of 35%
over calendar year 2013) and $3,527,864 in drug proceeds
(a 10% increase over calendar year 2013).
The SNP-CALMMET- Treasury fund is a newly established
self-balancing fund with restricted revenue. This budget is

The Traffic Violator Fund is a self-balancing fund with
restricted revenue. This budget is intended to fund/reimburse
personnel costs and services and supplies associated
with the program. Based on funds available, the base budget
for FY 2015-16 includes a $260,000 transfer out to Sheriff-
Coroner for reimbursement of 2.15 positions compared to
4.25 positions in FY 2014-15.
This fund is a self-balancing fund with restricted revenue,
intended to fund costs for correctional purposes. All obligated
fund balance is being allocated to partially offset revenue
shortfalls in Immigration Customs and Enforcement
(ICE), U.S. Marshal and other revenues.
SCAAP funding is subject to annual budget approval by
the Federal Government. In past years, there has been
discussion at the Federal level of discontinuing this
funding source. However, each year the Federal Government
continued to approve funding at a reduced level.
In prior years, the Department had kept fund balances
sufficient to cover ongoing costs. However, as a result of
economic challenges that have negatively impacted
Sheriff-Coroner, the Obligated Fund Balance in Fund
13P has been utilized to offset the revenue shortfall in
the Sheriff's Main Operating Budget. Due to the decline
in Federal allocations, the fund balances are no longer
available to offset future year's anticipated costs.
This fund is a self-balancing fund with restricted revenue.
The base budget includes planned replacement and major
maintenance requirements of key Department equipment
scheduled to occur following FY 2014-15.
The key trends in mobile computing are the enhancements
to connection speed, reliability, coverage and
security. The Mobile Data Computer (MDC) Project will
continue to remain in the forefront of these advancements.
¦ With the increase in cyber-threats, OCSD is in the process
of improving security with a combination of new
equipment, better applications and the eventual implementation
of multi-factor authentication.
¦ The Department will continue to plan strategically and
to identify other major equipment replacement and
maintenance items to be included in this Fund in order
to maintain future operational needs of the Department.
The Sheriff's Substation Fee Program is a self-balancing
fund with restricted revenue. The Sheriff's ability to use this
fund has ceased since the department is leasing this Saddleback
Station rather than purchasing it. The language in the
Rancho Mission Viejo Development Agreement restricts the
funding to be used for construction and land acquisition.
County Counsel, Rancho Mission Viejo and Sheriff's personnel
are collaborating on finding alternative ways to use this
funding.
The station serves several law enforcement cities and is
occupied 24/7. The parking lot and many areas in the
building are in need of repair and/or replacement to
keep it running at optimum level.
The Jail Commissary Fund is a self-balancing fund that does
not rely on support from the County General Fund. Operational
and product costs are projected to increase in FY
2015-16.
During FY 2014-15, the number of County inmates
decreased due to the passage of Proposition 47, and as
result, Jail Commissary profits have decreased.
The Inmate Welfare Fund is a self-balancing fund with
restricted revenue. This budget is intended to fund inmate
programs and operational costs. There will be an increase in
FY 2015-16 for inmate services programs and operational
costs.
Inmate population has declined which has affected
Commissary sales. In addition, the largest source of revenue
is the inmate telephone commissions and current
considerations by the Federal Communications Commission
(FCC) to regulate calling rates leaves an uncertain
future for telephone revenues.
The Cal-ID Operational Cost Fund is a self-balancing fund
with restricted revenue. The revenue includes fees collected
from Cal-ID Users (cities). The budget is intended to fund
operational costs in Fund 109. The Fiscal Year 2015-2016
Budget includes a $954,616 transfer out to Fund 109.
The trend continues to shift from traditional fingerprint
identification databases to multi-modal biometric identification
systems, capable of storing several types of
physical features for identification. Fingerprints, facial
images, iris patterns, and voice patterns are among the
biometric modalities being considered by local law
enforcement to maximize the ability to identify criminals.
¦ The inability for disparate local, state, national, and
international identification systems to communicate
with one another is no longer a permanent obstacle.
The momentum is in the direction on interoperability,
being able to search an unlike system and allowing
unlike systems to search our local data.
¦ These trends will impact the Cal-ID operation and will
result in more technically skilled staff with a more
diverse skill set.
The Cal-ID System Costs Fund is a self-balancing fund with
restricted revenue. There are no transfers to Fund 109 from
Fund 14E budgeted for Fiscal Year 2015-16.

This fund is a self-balancing fund with restricted revenue,
which supplements jail operations and construction costs, as
well as supports front-line law enforcement in the unincorporated
areas of Orange County. There are no significant,
planned changes in FY 2015-16 compared to FY 2014-15.
This funding source is subject to State budget approval
each year. It is anticipated that the State will continue to
approve funding in the future; however, funding levels
cannot be projected.
FY 2015-16 Recommended Budget for Alternate Defense
services includes $5,701,519 Appropriations and $5,615,519
Net County Cost, which is $163,559 (3%) more than FY
2014-15 final budget of $5,451,960. The OC Superior Court
provides administrative support to Alternate Defense and
receives reimbursement from the County.
FY 2015-16 Net County Cost (NCC) for Trial Court 081 is
$40,547,374, which $1,044,698 (2.6%) increase over FY
2014-15.
FY 2015-16 Budgeted revenue estimated to be less than
required Revenue MOE payment to the State, which means
there will be negative excess MOE payment to the State.
AB233 Revenue MOE payment was set in 1997 based on
actual revenue receipts in FY 1994-95, which means FY
2014-15 Trial Court revenue will be lower than FY 1994-95
level.
FY 2013-14 3rd Available Financing projections include
$927,449 NCC overrun due to lower court revenue. FY 2015-
16 $64,109,110 Appropriations include:
1. $54,449,487 AB233 MOE payment to the State,
2. $4,699,348 SB1732 County Facility Payment (CFP)
to the State,
3. Excess AB233 MOE payment to State $0,
4. Supplemental Judicial Benefits $1,825,700, and
5. Other $3,134,5755 consist of Victim Witness Services
$2,842,062, insurance and earthquake insurance
cost $225,146 for court facilities, Court
transcript costs for Grand Jury Hearings $45,000
and accounting and telephone services $21,367.
While OC Community Resources' baseline Net County Cost
limit will grow 3% in FY 2015-16, OC Community Services
and OC Animal Care programs will continue to be challenged
by increases in salaries and benefits, services, and
other costs with either level or minimal growth in revenues.
As the result, both OC Community Services and OC Animal
Care programs must continue to closely monitor and reduce
costs while maximizing the use of existing revenues.
The FY 2015-16 OC Community Resources' budget continues
to face economic challenges of rising costs of
maintaining services with flat or minimal increases in
funding. As the result of increasing salaries and
employee benefits, as well as, increasing services and
supplies costs, OC Community Resources reduced
expenditures where possible and will continue to subsist
on a lean budget.
The Fund 106 Budget for FY 2015-16 includes $300,000 to
repay a loan to OC Parks Fund 405. Fund 106 borrowed the
$300,000 from Fund 405 in FY 2012-13 to pay the City of
Newport Beach for dredging a section of lower Newport Bay
owned by Newport Tidelands.
Fund 106 has re-budgeted three substantial capital
projects for FY 2015-16 including $385,000 to repair the
Newport Harbor Patrol ways cart (which hauls Sheriff
patrol boats out of the water for repair), $500,000 to
repair Upper Newport Bay East Bluff Drainage System,
and $114,900 to install interpretive kiosks in Upper
Newport Bay.
The FY 2015-16 Proposed Budget decreases approximately
$251K compared to the FY 2014-15 Modified Budget. This is
due to the gradual spending of the existing fund balance carried
forward from previous fiscal years as well as lower interest
received as the fund balance is drawn down.
Library capital improvement projects are contingent upon
available funding. Capital projects budgeted in FY 15-16
include Dana Point HVAC and Siding Replacement, La Habra
Air Handler and Ventilation Replacement, Laguna Beach
Exterior Siding Replacement, Rancho Santa Margarita Air
Handler and Ventilation Replacement, Foothill Ranch Solar
upgrade, Silverado Branch Expansion, Westminster HVAC
upgrade and OCPL Headquarters HVAC and Solar Array
projects.
Funding provided for Foothill Ranch Solar upgrade is primarily
from Foothill Ranch Edison Rebate Developer
Deposit.
Each Library branch facility will continue to be maintained
and upgrades and enhancements will be provided
contingent upon available funding. In FY 2015-
16, building improvements and energy efficiency
upgrades will be carried out to increase energy conservation
and productivity.
FY 2015-16 budget increased by $467,070 in salaries and
benefits or 3% higher in comparison with FY 2014-15 Modified
Budget. This increase is primarily due to the addition of
nine positions transferred from OC Community Resources
in the Third Quarter Budget Report as part of OCCR's minor
reorganization.
Fund 120 revenue reflects a 4% increase in overall property
tax revenue due to an improving economy and housing market
within Orange County.
OC Public Libraries' Operating budget plan assumes boosting
current service levels by increasing library material purchases,
continuing the five year plan to upgrade the library
systems, completing the One-Desk Model, increasing broadband
for all libraries and continuing with needed maintenance
projects that were previously deferred in prior fiscal
years due to limitations in funding.
Under the guidance of the Library Advisory Board, OC Public
Libraries has been directed to establish a general reserve
equal to 10% of the operating budget. This requirement was
met in FY 2014-15, therefore in FY 2015-16 OC Public
Libraries is not required to reserve 10% of the operating
budget. Future contributions to reserves are contingent upon
available funding.
A local external customer survey was conducted by OC
Public Libraries from September to November, 2014
with the following results:
? 95% say that the customer service they received at the
library is a "very important feature of the library"
? 94% say that printed materials, including books,
magazines, etc. are "very important features of the
library"
? 84% say that online electronic services, which
includes e-material, are "very important features of
the library"
? 79% say that accessing the internet at the library was
easy
¦ OC Public Libraries will be evaluating the interior space
of all branches and redesigning them to conform to the
one-desk service model. For expediency, confidentiality
and efficiency, library users will be able to complete
their business transaction at one service location rather
than separate desks for each interaction. Customer
needs have changed over the years. The single service
desk model will provide a better customer experience
while freeing up librarians to have more time for difficult
questions and to have more interaction in the reading
area of the library.
¦ In redesigning the floor configuration, OC Public
Libraries is hoping to achieve the following goals:
¦ Provide a one stop transaction environment for library
users.
¦ Extend basic reference by freeing staff to have on the
floor interaction with library users.
¦ Provide efficient and flexible staffing solution.
In smaller libraries and larger libraries, use limited
space more efficiently.
¦ Change will inevitably be disruptive and uncomfortable,
but with communication and training, staff can
adopt the new single service desk model with little difficulty.
As it is, some branches have already converted
some of the multiple service desks into a single service
desk and have found it to be successful.
FY 2015-16 Recommended Budget increases by approximately
$262K when compared to the FY 2014-15 Modified
Budget due to higher professional service contract expenses.
FY 2015-16 Recommended Budget is approximately $419K
higher than the FY 2014-15 Modified Budget due to an
increase in human service contracts to better address the
critical needs of domestic violence victims and their children.
The FY 2015-16 Recommended Budget includes no major
changes and remains consistent with the FY 2014-15 Modified
Budget.
FY 2015-16 Recommended Budget is approximately $683K
higher than the FY 2014-15 Modified Budget due to more
professional service contracts spending as funded by the
Workforce Investment Act.
The FY 2015-16 Recommended Budget is $2.8 million
higher than the FY 2014-15 Modified Budget due additional
availability of Federal revenues for housing assistance payments.
The FY 2015-16 Recommended Budget is approximately
$782K higher than the FY 2014-15 Modified Budget due to
increasing spending on affordable housing projects.
The FY 2015-16 Recommended Budget is approximately
$620K less than the FY 2014-15 Modified Budget as a result
of CALHOME loan expense reductions.
FY 2015-16 Recommended Budget increases by approximately
$77K as compared to the FY 2014-15 Modified Budget
in anticipation of higher professional services expenses.
The FY 2015-16 Proposed Budget includes $1.0 million
increase in salaries and employee benefits for 16 additional
positions transferred from OCCR to OC Parks in the FY 14-
15 Third Quarter Budget Report as a result of OC Community
Resources' minor reorganization.
An operating transfer to Fund 406 of $14.2 million of which
$9.7 million will finance Fund 406's capital project requirements
and $4.5 million will increase Fund 406's capital
project reserve for future use is included in the FY 2015-16
baseline budget.
The FY 2015-16 baseline budget also includes a $3.0 million
increase in property tax revenue due to an improving economy.
OC Parks expects to receive sufficient funding in Fund
405 in FY 2015-16 to pay for park staff, maintenance
and improvement contracts, and other expenses
required to operate all OC Parks facilities for public use
and enjoyment.
¦ OC Parks' Operating Fund 405 continues to provide
funding for Fund 406's capital project requirements in
FY 2015-16 as well as increase capital project reserves
for future use.
¦ OC Parks budgets a contribution of $4.0 million to the
Operating Reserve in FY 2015-16 to maintain its established
goal of 20% of its actual salaries & benefits and
services & supplies.
The total FY 2015-16 Budget for Fund 406 is $31.1 million
which is approximately $2.6 million higher than the FY
2014-15 Modified Budget. The increase is due primarily to
the addition of $4.5 million to capital project reserves in FY
2014-15. These reserves will provide funding for future
planned park capital improvements.
In addition, Fund 406 has budgeted $14.2 million in transfers
in from Fund 405 in FY 2015-16. This transfer will provide
sufficient funding to pay for engineering and capital
project construction costs budgeted for FY 2015-16 and
increase capital project reserves.
OC Parks staff has budgeted for twenty-one capital
projects in Fund 406 in FY 2015-16 to further maintain
and protect park facilities and infrastructure. Included
is $6 million to dredge Sunset Harbor, $3.8 million to
repair the bridge and road at Aliso & Wood Canyons
Wilderness Park, $1 million to expand the maintenance
yard facility at Laguna Niguel Regional Park, $800,000
to replace the water supply system at Caspers Wilderness
Park, $1.35 million to construct drainage improvements
within Irvine Park, $720,000 to construct three
"pocket" parks along the Santa Ana River Trail, $1.47
million to restore and protect the creek bed running
through Riley Wilderness Park, $445,000 to repair and
restore a portion of the exterior of the Old County
Courthouse, and several other park capital projects.
CSS expect the federal and state allocations to remain flat for
FY 2015-16. CSS' FY 2015-16 base budget includes $57.5
million in appropriations offset by $56.2 million from Federal
(66%) and State (34%) revenue sources. To balance its
budget, CSS also included a Transfer In of $1.3 million from
Special Revenue Fund 12C to offset the expenditures. Due to
increasing costs, there is no Net County Cost contribution
included in FY 2015-16 Budget.
CSS continues to exceed federal performance measures
in percent of collections on current support and percent
of cases with arrears collection. The success of CSS plays
a key role in assisting families in achieving and maintaining
self-sufficiency.
¦ Through strategic planning, CSS continues to evaluate
existing program and processes and when possible
implement new technologies to achieve efficiencies,
improve performance, and increase effectiveness of
programs.
The base budget includes a transfer out of $1.3 million to
Child Support Services, Budget Control 027, to balance the
budget. Included in the $1.3 million is a $169K transfer out
to reimburse the excess of non-claimable principal over the
claimable building depreciation expenses. Interest earnings
is the Fund's primary revenue source, which is estimated at
only $85K as a result of continued low interest rates.
The base gross budget decreases $21.5 million primarily
related to the continued impact of Federal Health Reform.
These decreases are offset by decreased categorical revenues.
Reductions and cost containment measures implemented in
prior years are carried forward into the FY 2015-16
requested budget in order to align Department expenditures
with available funding levels.
HCA continues to face the challenge of providing
needed and often mandated health services with limited
resources. At State and federal levels, legislative
measures aimed at budget reduction could have a significant
impact on local funding for health care services.
¦ HCA is working towards a phased implementation of
two complete Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems
within two service areas, Correctional Health Services
(CHS) and Behavioral Health Services (BHS). The initial
phase of the build and successful implementation of
both EHRs was completed during the first part of 2014.
The subsequent phases include further development
and enhancements, and inclusion of additional functionality
and controls. The overall goal of these systems,
among many, is to provide electronic clinical documentation
management with improved decision support
capabilities, enhance privacy, and add security and
access control. This effort is consistent with national
priorities in health care to transform the nation's health
care system and improve the quality, safety, and efficiency
of patient healthcare through the use of electronic
health records.
¦ There will be continued emphasis within HCA on
implementing new Mental Health Services Act (MHSA)
programs in FY 2015-16, funded through available Prop
63 revenues. This year, the County has additional
MHSA "growth" funds that will allow expansion of
some existing programs where there are identified
unmet needs.
SSA's budget request was developed based on maximizing
projected Federal and State mandated social services program
funding allocations for Orange County. It includes
increases to the Medi-Cal, CalFresh, and CalWORKs allocations,
reflects an allocation of the 3% increase in Net County
Cost (NCC) limit, and uses reserve funds in the Wraparound
Program, Fund 12W, to fund expenses in SSA Operations,
Budget Control 063. SSA's base budget consists of increases
in salary and benefits, contracts for services, information
technology, facility improvements and other services
required to meet operating expenses.
In preparation of the FY 2015-16 budget, SSA reorganized its
operating and assistance budget structure to combine the
SSA's General Fund Budget Controls under one Budget Control,
063, for ease of identifying and reporting total SSA program
costs. These program costs will report using program
clusters to reflect all of the program administrative costs,
assistance payments and the distributed agency administrative
costs. The agency administrative costs will be identified
under the three primary programmatic Divisions (Family
Self Sufficiency, Adult Services and Assistance Programs and
Children and Family Services).
The Child Abuse and Neglect Reporting Act defines
child abuse and imposes an obligation for mandated
reporters to report child abuse. In the past 2 years there
has been a change to program policy requiring
increased documentation of information-only reports
for mandated reporters, thereby providing additional
information to improve decision making and referral
screening and investigation. This process improves
practice and safety decisions, but increases the time
spent entering information into State and local databases.
¦ The number of calls to the Child Abuse Registry and
referrals for Emergency Response increased substantially
in 2014. The Child Abuse Registry received a total
of 42,670 calls in 2014, an increase of 13% from 2013.
Additionally, the number of Emergency Response referrals
increased by 14.5% in 2014 with a total of 24,164 children referred and investigated. Call volume for Adult
Protective Services (APS) decreased in 2014 from 2013
but the number of reports taken increased. In 2013,
there were 17,821 calls versus 15,321 calls in 2014; in
2013, there were 8,464 reports taken and in 2014, there
were 9,671 reports taken.
¦ Medi-Cal provides health care coverage for California
residents who have limited resources and income.
Medi-Cal has been expanded significantly and new
standards regarding income, assets, and family composition
have been added as alternatives to the traditional
Medi-Cal eligibility rules. The number of new Medi-Cal
applications has increased by over 70% in FY 2013-14.
The number of active Medi-Cal cases grew 30% in FY
2013-14 and is expected to continue at the same rate for
FY 2014-15 based upon data trends through January
2015.
¦ The CalFresh caseload increased 10% in FY 2013-14.
This is significantly lower than growth during the recession,
which peaked at 42% in FY 2009-10. Caseloads
include single adults whose numbers have increased, in
part, due to the waiver of rules which required work or
other activities in order to receive benefits for more
than 3 months. Due to an improving job market, this
growth is projected to slow to 8.4% in FY 2014-15.
OC Public Works Fund 080 FY 2015-2016 Recommended
Base Budget changes:
Appropriations Request of $49,182,198 is $1,915,593 (4.1%)
higher than the FY 2014-2015 Modified Budget. This is primarily
due to an increase in Services & Supplies totaling $4.4
million (16.1%) for IT Services costs from CEO/ITS services
and rates, and Intrafund Transfers being higher by $534,220
(4.6%). Salaries & Benefits decreased by $1.9 million (-
6.3%) due to deletion of 12 positions related to OC Public
Works reorganization and transfer of 30 positions to CEO/
ITS as part of the strategic integration of Information Technology
Services. The $1.9 million decrease only reflects a 5.5
months appropriations savings since positions and appropriations
were deleted and transferred as part of the 1st
Quarterly Budget Augmentation approval process. Resulting
in $4.5 million annual savings.
Revenue Request of $35,655,045 is $3,517,454 higher
(10.9%) primarily due offsets for increased appropriation
costs and billing more County Departments for Pony Mail,
County Records Center, and Custodial services.
Net County Cost (NCC) of $13,527,153 is lower by a net of
$1,601,861. A decrease of $2.1 million NCC was for Pony
Mail, County Record Center, and Custodial services transferred
to user Departments, and an increase of $454,000 was
for a 3 percent growth given to all County General Fund budget
controls.
OC Facilities Maintenance & CUF 1) will continue an
effective Preventive Maintenance (PM) Program to
allow for scheduled preventive maintenance of County
facilities, reduce emergency repair costs, avoid costly
building/system shutdowns and be proactive regarding
the stewardship of public buildings and use of public
funds; 2) is working on the continued development of a
maintenance management database directing Preventive
Maintenance work and providing cost accounting
support; and 3) is working to produce an energy
demand model for each County facility to support strategic
project developments targeted at reducing
demand on utilities.
¦ OC Development Services will continue its programs of
training staff, improving morale, increasing efficiency,
educating the public, and providing the best and most
efficient customer service.
¦ The Agricultural Commissioner's portion of the OC
Environmental Resources Service Area will continue its
programs of training staff, educating the public, seeking
State funding and cooperatively partnering with the
State to achieve its goals.
OC Public Works Budget Control 034 OC Watersheds FY
2015-2016 Base Budget request of $14,501,193, is $1,912,738
(11.65%) lower than the FY 2014-2015 Modified Budget
through 2nd quarter adjustments. Salaries and Employee
Benefits decreased resulting from a review of controllable
costs including Overtime and Annual Leave Payoffs bringing
the budget lines more in-line with anticipated actual usage.
Services and Supplies decreased primarily due to decreased
costs for Professional Services and one-time projects budgeted
in the prior year.
Regulatory mandates continue to increase in number,
scope, and complexity. The Santa Ana and San Diego
Regional Water Quality Control Boards reissue municipal
National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
(NPDES) permits for the County, cities, and OC Flood
Control District every five years. In each renewal cycle,
mandates are added and expanded to increase the protection
of drinking water supply, fishing, swimming,
and other uses of Orange County's streams, bays, harbors,
and beaches.
¦ In addition to NPDES requirements, state and federal
regulators periodically assess the health of waterways.
When data show pollution levels are impairing the uses
of those waters, they are added to a list of water quality
impairments under the Federal Clean Water Act. In the
most recent update, the list of impairments in Orange
County increased from 122 to 130. A new regulation
called Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) is then
developed to correct each impairment. To date, 33
TMDLs have been adopted that impose corrective measures
on the County, OC Flood Control District, cities,
and other public and private entities. Both the currently
adopted mandates and the growth trend in this regulatory
arena are expected to outpace our resources to
address the problems as well as outpace our ability to
sustain compliance.
¦ The County has taken a leadership role in crafting regulatory
approaches as well as investing in science and
regulatory development to bring forward TMDL and
other regulations for adoption by the Regional Boards.
In collaboration with Riverside and San Bernardino
Counties, regulators, and other stakeholders, a major
revision to the Santa Ana Regional Boards basin plan
was developed to rationalize recreational water quality
standards for streams and channels. Once approved, it will retain strict standards for those streams where people
actually recreate and adjust standards in flood control
channels to reflect the actual risk to human health
based on usage; will modernize the water quality objectives
used to measure bacterial contamination; and will
suspend the requirement to meet recreational standards
during dangerous storm conditions in engineered channels.
As a result, cities and counties could invest their
limited resources in protecting those streams where recreation
occurs and human health may be at risk. Initiatives
are underway for improvements to existing
TMDLs for bacteria, sediment, and nutrients, and toxics.
¦ Integrated Regional Water Management Plans have
been completed for all three Watershed Management
Areas to develop collaborative water management strategies
and integrate the management of water supply,
water quality, flood management, and natural resource
protection. The plans identify solutions to meet regulatory
mandates and other water needs, and establish a
context for multiple agencies to collaborate on implementation.
The plans also position Orange County
agencies for grant funding opportunities and prioritize
implementation projects for each Watershed Management
Area.
A change in policy beginning FY 2015-2016 to bill all County
Departments for their utility usage reduced Fund 040 - Utilities
reliance on the General Fund by $14.1 million. The base
budget includes a net decrease of $9.5M in Net County Cost
(NCC) compared to FY 2014-2015 Modified Budget, the
$14.1M NCC reduction and distribution to all County
Departments for utility payment, offset by a $4.6 million
increase in NCC for the principal and interest on a potential
new $65 million bond for CUF upgrades and Civic Center
campus infrastructure replacements.
Energy surveys and modeling efforts have provided the
OC Facilities Maintenance & CUF team with critical
data in supporting our constant focus to develop a more
sustainable future. By supporting the development of
capital planning targeted to reduce agencies operational
demands, the Countys overall environmental footprint
can be reduced.
OC Public Works Budget Control 071 Building and Safety
General Fund FY 2015-2016 Base Budget request of
$11,167,200 is $1,878,944 (20.23%) higher than the FY
2014-2015 Modified Budget. The Salaries and Employee
Benefits costs reflect increases in Salaries, Retirement, and
Employee Group Insurance. Services and Supplies also
increased in FY 2015-2016 resulting from increased costs for
Professional Services related to direct charges for services
provided within the department. Equipment also increased
for costs relating to the Customer Relationship Management
(CRM) software system.
The overall increase is offset by an increase of $1,878,944 in
revenues due to an anticipated increase in Building and
Safety permit activity and the Board Approved OC Development
Fees, effective May 1, 2015.
When comparing 2014 to date with the same period
during 2013, the data represents an 80% increase in the
number of building permits issued. Based on recent
data and current market and recent activity, the permit
volume increase is expected to continue.
¦ OC Development Services will continue to monitor
workload levels and take appropriate mitigating actions
as necessary.
¦ OC Public Works/OC Development Services continues
to work with the building industry on further improvements
in its provision services, principally through the
Developmental Processing Review Committee
appointed by the Board of Supervisors and through the
Local Government Affairs Committee of the Building
Industry Association of Orange County.
The proposed budget includes the implementation of billing
all County Departments that utilize parking facilities for
County employees in the Civic Center area. The General
Fund contribution of $1.4 million to the Parking Fund has
been distributed by CEO to offset the additional cost to those
General Fund departments. With the additional revenue collected,
Parking Facilities will no longer have to rely on the
General Fund for structural improvements.
Reserves available for FY 2015-2016 decreased from FY
2014-2015. Reserves were used during FY 2014-2015 for
equipment purchases.
Use of AB2766 Subvention Funds will continue to promote
quantifiable strategies that specifically reduce
motor vehicle emissions. Subvention Funds will be considered
as a source of funding to encourage the development
of motor vehicle emission reduction measures or
projects that result in the reduction of motor vehicle
emissions in conjunction with the County's Green Fleet
Plan.
Total appropriation request for FY 2015-2016 is
$166,631,580 which is $28,618,124 (17.2%) higher than the
FY 2014-2015 Modified Budget through 2nd Quarter Adjustments.
The significant difference is due to the estimated
costs of Capital Improvement Projects requests being higher
than prior fiscal year.
Regulatory Permit Approval for Capital Project Construction:
securing regulatory permits is frequently the
longest activity and therefore the critical path for getting
a capital project prepared for construction. In addition,
permit conditions for mitigation measures, could
cost as much as the project construction in some cases.
Delays of several months, and in some cases years, have
been experienced.
¦ Construction costs appear to be increasing as we are
receiving fewer bids for construction of flood projects.
At a December 2014 City Engineers Association of
Orange County (CEAOC) seminar, a major construction
firm indicated economic construction trends in California
were increasing in cost over the next 2 years due to
an increase in construction starts and a decrease in
available skilled construction labor.
¦ A future trend is the adoption of alternative project
delivery methods for construction contracts, where
applicable. In addition to JOC, this may include Construction
Manager-at-Risk (CMAR) and Design-Build.
¦ Integrated Regional Watershed Management (IRWM)-
Incorporate Water Quality and Habitat Enhancements
into the Flood Control Infrastructure. Orange County's
channels are currently being designed with a much
broader vision beyond the safe conveyance of floodwaters
that includes environmental habitat, in-stream sediment
stabilization, erosion protection, water quality
treatment and recreational uses. The challenge for OC
Public Works is to find engineering and maintenance
solutions to accommodate multiple uses, while providing
for a specific level of flood capacity. These multiple
uses sometimes compete, and accommodating them
requires additional planning, permitting, mitigation,
construction, operation, and maintenance costs.
¦ Compliance with Regional Water Quality Control Board
(RWQCB) Permits, Compliance with two RWQCB permits
and with the new State Water Quality Construction
Permit is required. Compliance with these newer
requirements will result in increased project costs.
¦ Flood Insurance Rate Increases- Orange County has
approximately 22,700 acres having 37,332 parcels
within the FEMA 100-year floodplain. Since the passing
of the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of
2012 (BW-12), FEMA has raised flood insurance rates
for properties within the high risk (Zone A) areas to
reflect the true risk of properties to make the National
Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) more financially stable,
and change how Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)
updates impact policyholders. The changes mean premium
rate increases for some policyholders over time.
However the repeal of BW-12 was passed last year by
both Houses and the President. Flood insurance and
BW-12 will be re-evaluated but flood insurance rate
increases are still expected. The repeal does not eliminate
all of the increases required by BW-12.
The Fiscal Year 2015-16 expense budget includes appropriations
for engineering and construction costs related to the
Harbor Revitalization project as well as other facility maintenance
projects required in the Harbor. This includes $4.2
million budgeted for construction of landside improvements
planned as part of the Revitalization project and $4.6 million
budgeted to dredge portions of the Harbor water ways.
OC Dana Point Harbor continues to pursue key steps
required to implement the Revitalization Plan. This
includes developing a final design for the Commercial
Core project, finalizing a financial strategy, and acquiring
required construction permits. Additional Coastal
Development Permits will be required for the Dry Boat
Storage Building Project as well as the Marina Improvement
Project.
OC Dana Point Harbor continues to budget in FY 2015-16 for
operating transfer of approximately $300,000 from Dana
Point Tidelands Fund 108 into Fund 12K to provide sufficient
marina emergency repair funds.
The FY 2015-16 Recommended Base Budget is lower than
the FY 2014-15 Modified Budget, due to use of other funding
sources to offset the Disposition and Development Agreement
with Lowe Enterprises Real Estate Group for the entitlement
and development of the County's 100+ acres of land
at the former Marine Corps Air Station El Toro in Irvine.
Supplemental Assessment filed by the developer reduced the
assessment value for the real properties in the El Toro Redevelopment
areas.
In FY 2009-10, the Irvine Redevelopment Agency filed an
appeal to reduce prior year assessed values for the El Toro
parcels. This resulted in a reduction of assessed values and
negative supplemental property taxes for the El Toro parcels.
The Agency has requested no refund but will offset future
incremental property taxes. As a result of the withholdings,
Fund 15T received no incremental property tax revenue in
FY 2010-11 and received lower $667,147 revenue in FY 2011-
12. FY 12-13 revenue was budgeted at $518,075, which is less
than the $673,863 amount in the initial schedules and Recognized
Obligation Payment Schedule (ROPS) received from
the Irvine Redevelopment Agency. The revised ROPS from
the Oversight Board to Successor Agency to the Irvine Redevelopment
Agency shows a reduced amount of $110,000 is
anticipated for FY 12-13. As per County Implementation
Agreement No. 1, Fund 15T receives revenue within 30 days
after the close of the fiscal year.
Appropriations request of $335,000 is $53,000 higher than
FY 2014-15 Modified Budget and composed primarily of
rent from ground leases and incremental property tax.
In December 2011, the California Supreme Court
upheld Assembly Bill X1 26 dissolving redevelopment
agencies effective February 1, 2012. The City of Irvine
elected to become Successor Agency to the Irvine Redevelopment
Agency.
¦ The Successor Agency to the Irvine Redevelopment
Agency met and approved the ROPS on February 7,
2013, which included $256,754,898 for County Implementation
Agreement No. 1 to Fund 15T for FY 2013-14
(Year 7) through FY 2051-52 (Year 46). The approved
ROPS shows $110,000 FY 2013-14 estimated revenue
for the County Implementation Agreement to El Toro
Improvement Fund 15T. As per the County Implementation
Agreement, Fund 15T receives a certain percentage
of incremental property taxes, which changes with
changes in assessed value each year.
The base budget is $57,705,000 for planned capital projects
for terminal improvements, gate improvements, and passenger
processing system improvements.
All key trends for the Airport are contained in the narrative
for Airport Operating Fund 280.
The base budget is $33.9M for FY 2015/16. JWA will utilize
PFC revenue and transfers in from the JWA Operating Fund
(Fund-Department 280-280) to make debt service payments.
Operating costs decreased by a net $2.87 million primarily
due to the decrease in one-time transfers to OC Waste &
Recycling Postclosure Fund 279 and increases in construction
management, landfill gas service contracts, multidisciplinary
engineering support contracts, equipment, and
transfers to Reserves.
OC Waste & Recycling will continue to support the
County General Fund in FY 15/16 with an estimated
transfer of $17 million for bankruptcy debt obligations.
¦ OC Waste & Recycling continues to integrate disposal
capacity and strategic financial and operational planning,
maintains a competitive disposal rate, and continues
to manage risk/liability through diligent
administrative practices.
¦ OC Waste & Recycling continues with its ongoing habitat
mitigation efforts.
¦ OC Waste & Recycling operates and maintains state of
the art environmental control systems and continues to
work towards increasing the beneficial reuse of landfill
gas at the landfills.
¦ OC Waste & Recycling will continue development of the
Countys landfills in FY 15/16 with large capital expansion
projects.
Operating expenditures decreased by a net $20 million due
to the revisions in the scheduling of OCWR capital projects.
Expenditures in this fund will be financed by a combination
of transfers from OC Waste & Recycling Bankruptcy Recovery
Plan Fund (Fund-Department 285-299), OC Waste &
Recycling Operating Fund (Fund-Department 299-299)and
by interest earnings on the cash balance in the Fund.
The recommended base budget includes one technical augmentation
of $31.3 million to allow for the transfer of OCWR
funds in support of the County's IT projects, expansion of
the Musick facility, and OC Public Works' La Pata Gap Closure
Project.
The recommended base budget includes one technical augmentation
of $31.3 million to allow for the transfer of OCWR
funds in support of the County's IT projects, expansion of
the Musick facility, and OC Public Works' La Pata Gap Closure
Project.
Base Budget include one Reduce level of service augmentation
rolled into base budget to meet Net County Cost Limit.
Assessor is requesting one-time restoration of $475,301 to
initiate transition of contract application support from an
outside vendor to the County IT Sourcing contractor, as part
of long range planning to provide stable and consistent
application support for ATS II.
The Base Budget also includes one technical adjustment to
add one regular Executive Assistant position offset by one
delete Appraiser position. There is no financial impact to the
base budget by this exchange.
The Auditor-Controller defunded 4 positions in order to
meet the Net County Cost Limits.
The Base Budget also includes one technical adjustment to
add one regular Executive Assistant position offset by one
delete Secretary III position. There is no financial impact to
the base budget by this exchange.
The Auditor-Controller Department has been able to
continually meet established Net County Cost limits
through careful analysis, planning, and limiting
requests to those that are essential to the mission and
goals of the department.
FY 2015-16 Recommended Base Budget is $983,650. FY
2014-15 projected Net County Cost is $810,224, which is
based on January 31, 2015 actuals. The most recent projections
show Net County Cost estimates of $781,532 for FY
2014-15.
FY 2015-16 Clerk of the Board's Services Supplies Budget
was increased by $275,000 to provide services to Board of
Supervisors.
Changes included in the FY 2015-16 Recommended Base
Budget results in the Net County Cost (NCC) required totaling
$16,167,381, in which the NCC Limit is $15,505,154. In
order to meet the NCC Limit, one Administrative Manager I
position on Leave of Absence, one vacant Staff Specialist
position from CEO Administration and one vacant Administrative
Manager II position from Budget Office were
defunded. Also, appropriations were reduced for Department
Memberships and Transportation & Travel for meetings/
conferences. The increase in expenditure budget from
FY 2014-15 to FY 2015-16 is due to the annualization of nine
Real Estate positions (three Administrative Manager I positions,
two Administrative Manager II positions, three Real
Property Agent III positions and one Staff Specialist position),
one Office Specialist position for Board of Supervisors'
Reception, one Administrative Manager I position for Special
Projects and one Office Specialist position/one Office
Technician position for CEO Administration Office Services
that were included in the FY 2014-15 1st/2nd Quarter Budget
Reporting Process. The increase in revenue budget from FY
2014-15 to FY 2015-16 is due to higher charges for services
for Real Estate services provided to departments. The
increase in NCC is due to a 3% NCC growth and reallocation
of NCC from OC Public Works to CEO for custodial services
and utilities costs.
¦ Infrastructure Needs: The County's aging infrastructure
at the Civic Center will require significant investment
over the next few years. This includes building maintenance
and potentially new construction of office space.
Jail capacity is near the limit of the existing facilities.
With AB 109 (prisoner realignment), the increase in
inmate population has put pressure on the Sheriff to
reduce the population of immigration detainees, which
brings revenue to the County. New jail construction is
underway at the Musick Facility in Irvine. This project
was funded with State grants; however, the cost to operate
the facility will be a County responsibility and
another future funding challenge.
¦ Human Resource Services Centralization: Human
Resource Services will be continuing to examine ways to
maximize workforce productivity, including establishing
a mechanism for extended use of part-time or temporary
help.
¦ IT Centralization: During FY 2014-15, the County Executive
Officer created an IT Centralization Working
Group to develop a plan for moving a number of IT service
areas under the reporting structure of the County
Chief Information Officer (CIO). The Working Group is
preparing an IT shared services proposal to be considered
by the Board of Supervisors. The objective is to
achieve greater efficiencies through the use of pooled
resources, streamlining processes and standardizing
technology platforms.
¦ Revenue-Generating Opportunities: CEO Real Estate is
in the preliminary stages of developing a marketing and
advertising initiative for the County to generate long
term revenue. All departments have participated with
thoughts/ideas and identified assets and opportunities
available to their respective agencies for consideration
and inclusion in the initiative.
¦ Complete a Civic Center Strategic Plan, including the
future use and occupancy of Building 16 and other
owned/leased buildings in the Civic Center area.
¦ Complete the entitlement process for the Greenspot
project to maximize its value for continued funding of
the Santa Ana River project.
¦ Develop approximately 1,900 acres of County owned
land with private developers as partners, which
includes 140 developable acres at the former Marine
Corps Air Station El Toro.
¦ Develop long term revenues from real estate lease and
rent payments, which may over the next 85 years, generate
approximately $4,000,000,000 in lease revenue.
¦ Continue to develop a strategic plan to use County facilities
more efficiently and cost effectively.
¦ CEO Real Estate will continue to collaborate with new
partners in FY 2015-16 for cost savings and enhanced
revenue streams. Currently, Orange County Public
Works, Social Services Agency, Orange County Parks
and Dana Point Harbor Real Estate have transitioned
under CEO Real Estate.
¦ Standardized Best Practices: The goal of the CEO's office
is to create standardized best practices, including measurable
goals and benchmarks. The office is setting a
business-focused vision for agencies and departments
with an emphasis on consistent customer service.
Training and Succession Planning: One clear way to provide
benefits for employees, even in light of the County's
financial challenges, is to encourage training opportunities
through OC Leadership Academy, Passport to
Your Future program and other skill-enhancing workshops.
Additionally, the CEO is committed to creating a
process for succession planning to prepare a new generation
of County Leadership.
Changes included in the FY 2015-16 Recommended Base
Budget results in the Net County Cost (NCC) required totaling
$4,589,075, in which the NCC Limit is $4,199,075. In
order to meet the NCC Limit, three Reduce/Restore Augmentations
were submitted, which includes the reduction of
$200K for costs associated with investigative personnel services
for Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO), $175K for
labor negotiation services and $15K for Equal Employment
Opportunity (EEO) Hotline. The increase in expenditure
budget from FY 2014-15 to FY 2015-16 is due to the annualization
of Learning and Organizational Development and
recruitment and employment records/transaction processing
positions that were included in the FY 2014-15 1st/2nd
Quarter Budget Reporting Process offset with Cost Apply to
other County departments for Human Resource services
provided. The increase in revenue budget from FY 2014-15
to FY 2015-16 is due to the increase in Charges for Services
to departments for Human Resource services provided. The
decrease in NCC from FY 2014-15 to FY 2015-16 is due to the
removal of one-time items approved in FY 2014-15 offset
with FY 2015-16 3% NCC growth.
Identifying and making policy decisions in regards to
Affordable Care Act requirements.
¦ Use of Extra Help employees.
¦ Labor negotiations: OCAA, OCEA, AOCW, ACLEM,
OCMA and salary reopener with AOCDS.
¦ Use of COIN ordinance during new labor negotiations
with OCEA and AOCW.
¦ Examining current County Mission Statement, Vision
and Goals.
¦ Implementation of employment development programs
on a County-wide basis.
We continue to experience an escalation in workloads
resulting from litigation by and against the County in
areas of construction, information technology, environmental,
labor and other areas.
The Registrar of Voters FY15/16 budget submittal includes
an augmentation for costs anticipated in the June 2016 Primary
Election.
Orange County has seen a growth in Vote-by-Mail voting
without all Vote-by-Mail elections. The percentage
of Orange County voters choosing Vote-by-Mail is
increasing, while the percentage of votes completed at
the polling places is slowly declining.
¦ Voting system continues to age - enhanced maintenance
program will continue throughout 2015. Following on
the Department's 2014 Voting System Analysis report
an RFI will be issued in the 4th calendar quarter of
2015. Voting system replacement requirements are
included in the Strategic Financial Plan.
¦ Overall survey results from voters and poll workers
reflect extremely well on the operations and services
provided. Several customer service surveys will be
taken during the June 2016 Primary Election.
¦ The Secretary of State launched the Online Voter Registration
statewide for all Californians. Voters will be able
to electronically register to vote, change their address,
political party, etc. We will use their signature from
their driver's license or identification card on file with
the DMV.
¦ Continue promoting voter outreach at various events
throughout Orange County.
The FY 2015-16 Base Budget request is submitted $949,394
above the NCC Limit. A Reduce Level of Service Augmentation
has been submitted to meet NCC limit.
The Revenue budget is $11,598,605, an increase of approximately
$305,000 over FY 14-15, as the TTC expects FY 2015-
16 revenues to approximate FY 14-15 actuals. The FY 14-15
current year secured tax collection rate of 99.24% is the
highest on record.
The Expense budget is $13,652,609, an increase of $1.57
million from FY 14-15 primarily due to increases in Salaries
& Employee Benefits (S&EB) of $722,000, Services and Supplies
(S&S) of $634,000, and Equipment of $218,000. The
S&EB base budget increase includes $305,000 for positions
defunded in the FY 14-15 approved budget, regular salaries
of $178,000 to fill vacant positions needed for core operations,
new Retirement and Insurance costs of $160,000, and
$58,000 for Board approved unfunded salary increases. The
S&S increase includes $315,000 in new charges from OC
Public Works, increased activity and charges from Merchant
Card Services of $169,000, and increased CEO-I.T. costs of
$55,000. The Equipment charge is for the replacement of the
Tax Collector Division IVR system that is past the end of its
useful life.
Maintaining the public trust by meeting the investment
objectives of safety, liquidity, and yield.
¦ Reducing costs and increasing assets under management
that increase net yields to pool participants.
¦ Increasing secured tax bill collection rates.
¦ Increasing usage of eCheck, which is the most cost
effective payment method.
¦ Additional payment options for taxpayers.
¦ Increasing public information on web, for 24/7 taxpayer
accessibility.
¦ Reducing investment compliance findings with no
investment related compliance finding in FY 14-15.
¦ Providing cost effective options to schools and community
college districts in the form of Temporary Transfers.
The FY 2015-16 Base Budget includes $279,500 of appropriations
that will be used for the purchase of remittance processing
equipment.
Internal Audits FY 2015-16 base budget maintains a similar
level of operations. However, the base budget exceeds the Net
County Cost limit of $2,706,224 by $129,866. A Reduce Level
of Service Augmentation to defund one position (represents
6% of the authorized 16 positions) has been submitted to
meet the NCC limit.
Internal Audit is requesting a restore augmentation to fund
one vacant position to meet the core audit responsibilities of
internal control audits that help identify business risks and
help management maintain the integrity of the Countys key
financial processes and systems.
Dynamic Financial Environment of the County: This
includes managing budgetary constraints caused by
State Legislature changes or economic conditions
beyond our control. Such an environment requires flexibility
in the annual Audit Plan. As such, the Internal
Audit Department (IAD) must be ready to respond to
unscheduled assignments from a majority of the Board
of Supervisors or the Audit Oversight Committee. We
estimate hours required for Board of Supervisors'
requested audits based on history and reserve hours in
the Audit Plan specifically for this purpose.
¦ Staff Retention and Replacement: Because the IAD is a
small department, each of our staff is significant to the
accomplishment of the Audit Plan. All members including
the Audit Director perform original work and complete
numerous audits.
¦ OC Fraud Hotline Activities: IAD has operated the OC
Fraud Hotline since it was established in the 1990s. In
recent years there has been a steady increase in the
number and complexity of allegations made via the
Hotline. In calendar year 2014, the volume of Hotline
reports was approximately two and one-half times that
of 2011. IAD continues to evaluate the need to modify
and reform its Hotline processes to respond to the
increasing use of the Hotline by the Countys employees
and the public.
¦ Information Technology (IT) issues: The pace of technological
advancement and the benefits to be realized
by implementing these advances to improve County
business operations is increasing at an accelerating
speed. As such, Information Technology (IT) Audits
continue to be an important part of our audit efforts.
The IT audit process complements and may integrate
with the Internal Control Audits (ICA). ICAs are audits
that determine whether controls and processes are in
place over critical business processes, and include an
evaluation of the adequacy and integrity of internal
controls. We also perform computer assisted audit techniques
(CAATs). CAATs are automated queries applied
to large amounts of electronic data searching for specified
characteristics, such as our automated review of
purchasing card transactions.

System funded from Fund 289 (FY 14/15 3rd QBAR
carryover)
2. $3,500,000 as placeholder for an initial cost of the
new Property Tax System funded from the OC Waste
& Recycling financing
FY 2015-16 Recommended Budget is $5,668,116, which
include $3,050,959 for capital and maintenance projects for
Probation facilities and $2,617,157 for debt service on Sheriff-
Coroner's facility.
FY 2015-16 Recommended Budget is funded from
$2,035,500 operating revenue, $2,000,000 operating transfer
in from Budget Control 036, and $1,632,617 projected carryoverfund
balance from FY 2014-15.
The $5,668,116 appropriations for FY 2015-16 excludes:
1. $2,116,000 expand level of service augmentation for
Probation's Juvenile Hall Multi-purpose Gym offset
by draw from Probation reserves and transfer from

The primary use of these court penalties, fines, and fees is to
make $3.9 million Debt Service payments on Juvenile Justice
Center Bonds and Civic Center Expansion COP, which will be
paid off in June 2019.
FY 2015-16 Proposed Expense Budget is $3,943,390, which
is no significant change from FY 2014-15. FY 2011-12 State
Controller's Court revenue audit findings resulted in a substantial
decline ($1.9M or 42%) in ongoing revenue to Fund
105. FY 2013-14 revenue was not sufficient to fund the bond
payments in Fund 105. In order to avoid the projected negative
fund balance at the year-end (6/30/14), a resolution for a
General Fund Temporary Transfer "Resolution" to loan up to
$1.3 million from the County General Fund to Fund 105 was
submitted for Board consideration. This resolution avoided
the projected negative cash balance in Fund 105 and allowed
the Fund to meet the required debt service obligation. The
County Board of Supervisors approved a similar resolution
for $2.5 million on June 26, 2012. The $3.8 million loan was
not recorded as a Transfer-In to Fund 105, which resulted in
a positive cash balance but a negative fund balance at the
year-end. Fund 105 will repay $3.8 million to the General
Fund whenever excess funds are available in Fund 105 after
meeting its Debt Service obligations. After the payment of
final Juvenile Justice Center Bonds in June 2019 or earlier, all
available funds (including bond reserves) in Fund 105 will
be used to repay all loans from the County General Fund
before transferring the remaining balance to the State.
The 800 MHz Countywide Coordinated Communications
(CCCS) fund is a self-balancing budget with restricted revenue.
The Base Budget includes a balancing entry to reflect
over-financing to match anticipated Fund Balance Available
at year-end. This budget is intended to fund 800 MHz CCCS
equipment and infrastructure costs that will be used in
future years for 800 MHz CCCS equipment purchases and
radio site development.
Interoperable communications for First Responders.
¦ Extending the useful life of the 800 MHz CCCS network
and subscriber fleet, as a migration path towards the
next generation system.
¦ Federal Communications Commission (FCC) required
Rebanding planning and implementation.
The FY 2015-16 Recommended Base Budget is $4.3M, which
is an increase of $2.1M, compared to when the budget was
established in mid-year FY 2014-15, to include a full 12
months of appropriations. The Base Budget includes $4.3M
Cost Apply to OCPW Budget, resulting in zero appropriations
for FY 2015-16.
During FY 14-15 the County Executive Officer created
an IT Centralization Working Group to develop a plan
for moving a number of IT service areas under the
reporting structure of the County CIO. The Working
Group is preparing an IT shared services proposal to be
considered by the Board. Pending Board approval, it is
anticipated that agencies'/departments' IT positions
would be transferred to Budget Control 037.
The County is actively researching solutions that will
result in ultimately retiring the mainframe platform
and porting the applications currently supported by the
mainframe to more sustainable and cost-effective hardware
and software solutions.
Fund 14F will be closed at the end of FY 14-15. In FY 15-16,
the Investment Consultant contract and offsetting reimbursement
will be budgeted in Budget Control 056.
The known projected costs associated with implementation
of the provisions of the Patient Protection and
Affordable Care Act (PPACA) have also been included in
the FY 15-16 budget request.
Base budget anticipated to increase by $12.6M due to an
increase in SAIC Scope 1 rates/charges ($5.3M), increase in
Xerox Scope 2 Transformation activities ($3.7M), and
increase in the indirect overhead rate ($2.2M). The indirect
overhead rate will increase from 12.5% to 15.12% due to additional Enterprise Security staff ($0.2M), Enterprise
Architecture & Research and Development staff ($1.1M),
County Counsel support ($0.3M), and Data Center maintenance
and electrical costs ($0.5M). Revenue budget is
$75.7M, an increase of $8.1M due to increase in IT billings to
Agencies/Departments.
During FY 14-15 the County Executive Officer created
an IT Centralization Working Group to develop a plan
for moving a number of IT service areas under the
reporting structure of the County CIO. The Working
Group is preparing an IT shared services proposal to be

greater efficiencies through the use of pooled resources,
streamlining processes, and standardizing technology
platforms.
Medical inflation (trend) nationwide continues to rise causing
an increase in medical, hospital, and prescription drug
costs. These rising costs are reflected in an increase in health
plan premiums.
Medical inflation (trend) continues to rise causing an
increase in medical, hospital, and prescription drug
costs. These rising costs are reflected in an increase in
County health plan premiums as well as for other
employers.
¦ As the result of implementation of the provisions of the
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA),
additional fees have been added to the health plan premiums
in 2015. Employee Benefits staff will continue to
monitor the cost impact implemented PPACA changes
have on health plan claims costs and health plan rates
for the 2016 plan year and beyond.
Unemployment claims experience has continued to decline.
This has allowed the rate holiday for County departments to
be continued from FY 13-14 through FY 15-16. Savings
associated with reductions in claim experience is held to
maintain sufficient reserves to fund potential economic
downturns or internal labor market issues.
Due to the economic downturn, layoffs and the Federal
extension program, the number of claims and amount
of benefit paid significantly increased in FY 08-09 and
again in FY 09-10. The Federal legislation increased the
benefit from 26 to 46 weeks and weekly maximum benefit
from $450 to $475. To assist the Departments with
their NCC budget targets no premiums were charged
from July 2009 through February 2010.
¦ In FY 10-11, the claims experience improved slightly
from FY 09-10 which enabled the Unemployment rate
charged to Departments to be reduced in FY 11-12 from
.0028 to .0027 of payroll. The claims experience in FY
11-12 improved slightly from FY 10-11 and allowed the
Unemployment rate charged to Departments to remain
at .0027 of payroll in FY 12-13. Unemployment claims
experience has continued to decline to levels commensurate
with FY 07-08. The drop in claims has allowed
for rate holiday for County departments from FY 13-14
through FY 15-16.
Medical inflation (trend) continues to rise and has been
causing an increase in medical and prescription drug claims
within the PPO plans for employees and retirees.
HR/Employee Benefits staff is currently analyzing the
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) to
determine potential cost impacts of this health care reform
legislation on further health plan rate increases for 2016 plan
year and beyond.
Medical inflation (trend) continues to rise and has been
causing an increase in medical and prescription drug
claims within the PPO plans. The overall medical and
pharmacy claims expenses for employees and retirees
are expected to continue to rise with medical inflation.
Workers' Compensation charges to program participants
will increase in FY 2015/16 as a result of a strategic funding
decision to increase program funding as outlined in the
Board approved funding policy.
Workers' Compensation claim costs are increasing due
to rising medical costs, however, the County's loss rate
and claim frequency are significantly below the benchmark
average for other California counties.
Property & Casualty Risk charges to program participants
will be flat in FY 2015/16.
Commercial insurance premiums are leveling and
insurance market conditions are currently stable.
OC Fleet Services Fund 296 FY 2015-2016 Base Budget
Request of $33,515,258 is $2.04 million (7%) higher than the
FY 2014-2015 Modified Budget through 2nd Quarter Adjustments.
This is primarily due to an increase in the Equipment
and Depreciation appropriation requests. With the County
centralization of purchase of light duty vehicles beginning
FY 2015-2016, the number of vehicle purchase increase
along with a high volume of vehicle replacements being
requested by County Departments and Agencies as depreciated,
obsolete, and vehicles with safety issues need to be
replaced.
One of the biggest challenges facing the County's fleet is
the overall age of county vehicles. The average age of the
countys fleet exceeds 11 years, well over the industry
benchmark. Older fleets result in higher operational
costs (maintenance repairs and fuel). As the economy
continues to improve, resale prices in the used vehicle
market are returning to historical norms causing many
fleets in the private sector to accelerate vehicle replacement
schedules to take advantage of the higher resale
prices. The county could benefit from removing and
selling its low-use vehicles and investing in a fleet modernization
plan that includes analysis of optimal vehicle
replacement cycles.
As a result of the Modernization Project being on hold, FY
15-16 proposed budget reflects a decrease of $589,811 over
the FY 14-15 budget.
Publishing Services's rates are proposed to remain
unchanged for FY 15-16.
The inflationary trend for dental claims has been less than
expected which has allowed the dental rate charged to the
Departments to remain unchanged. The budget also
includes funding for a Wellness vendor who will assist in the
administration of the County's Healthy Steps program.
The inflationary trend for dental claims has been less
than expected which has allowed the dental rate
charged to the Departments to remain unchanged.
¦ Salary continuance rates have remained unchanged
since FY 12-13.
Life insurance rates are projected to decline over 50% due to
the negotiated rates with a new vendor in 2016.
Life insurance rates are projected to decline over 50%
due to the negotiated rates with a new vendor in 2016.
¦ The budget also assumes no changes to the Accidental
Death and Dismemberment (AD&D) premiums.
