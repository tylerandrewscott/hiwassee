This budget is recommended at $15,000.
This budget unit does not receive any
funding directly from the General Fund;
however, $6,500, which is Sutter County’s
portion of the Maintenance and
Replacement costs, is budgeted as an
Interfund expense in the Agricultural
Commissioner’s budget unit (2-601) and is
unchanged compared to FY 2011-12. The
rest of the funding is provided by revenues
collected from Yuba and Nevada Counties.

This budget is recommended at $2,591,598.
The General Fund provides 50% of the
financing for this budget unit and is
increased by $6,973 (0.5%) compared to FY
2011-12. Excluding the increase in
Intrafund Plant Acquisition of $57,599
related to the Facility Expansion project, the
General Fund contribution has been reduced
by $50,626 (4%) compared to FY 2011-12.
In May of 2012, the Board approved the
transfer of one filled Ag Field Assistant II
position to the Road fund. This transfer was
precipitated by the recommended transfer of
the roadside weed control program to the
Public Works Road Division.
Responsibility for the large equipment
vehicle (#505) is also being transferred.
In an effort to reduce budgeted costs, Extra
Help is recommended at $13,400. This is a
$21,600 (62%) decrease over FY 2011-12.
This will limit the ability of the department
to respond quickly to requests from the
public for service in the field.
Professional & Specialized Services is
recommended at $1,200, which is a $61,955
(98%) decrease over FY 2011-12. This
reduction is related to the elimination of the
USDA Wildlife Services contract. This
program provides for wildlife damage
management on properties within the
County. This program provides public
health benefits by removing rabid and
diseased wild animals. Sutter County
provides 63% of the cost and USDA
matches remaining 37%. With the
elimination of the County’s 63% cost
reimbursement, USDA will eliminate the
program for Sutter County and
responsibility for these services will shift to
the County or services will not be provided.
The FY 2011-12 budget included $308,000
in Intrafund Plant Acquisition for the
expansion of the Agricultural
Commissioner’s portion of the building to
accommodate moving employees out of lab
space and housing them in the main facility.
The expansion would also improve
conditions for the over 9,000 members of
the public who visit the facility each year.
On December 6, 2011, the Board of
Supervisors awarded a contract to complete
the design of this expansion (Phase one) and
evaluated changes to the existing space that
would enhance workflow and improve
accommodations for the public (Phase two).
The estimated cost of construction for Phase
one came in higher than anticipated
(increased cost of $225,000) due to several
unforeseen and unavoidable concerns.

Electrical Service costs are
increased because additional service
is unavailable to accommodate the
additional space and service must
be increased.
 The HVAC system is already
overloaded and would need to be
replaced.
 All ADA improvements to the
building must be completed.
Alternatives to continuing with this project
were considered by the Agricultural
Commissioner, Public Works, and the
CAO’s office; however, none of the
alternatives provided sufficient savings to
discontinue the project.
 Adding temporary trailers to house
staff, which does not improve staff
oversight and coordination and
decreases public access, requires the
same additional electrical costs.
 Relocating the Farm Advisor staff,
collocated in this building, and
moving Agricultural Commissioner
staff to utilize the entire building,
required significant additional
monthly cost and reduces public
access for those who visit both
departments at the same time.
On May 22, 2012, the Board of Supervisors
approved the use of $167,401 of
unanticipated Unclaimed Gas Tax revenue
from FY 2011-12 for costs associated with
the Facility Expansion project. The funds
are being spent on the pre-purchase of items
for this project (PG&E costs, an air
conditioner, siding, etc.) thus reducing the
$225,000 estimated increased cost for this
project to $57,599.
The FY 2012-13 Recommended Budget
includes a re-budget of the project at

$365,599 with the same funding sources (no
General Fund cost) identified in the FY
2011-12 budget.
 The cancellation of $30,000 in the
General Fund designation for Future
Remodel was completed in FY 2011-
12.
 Use of Unclaimed Gas Tax revenue
of $167,401 in FY 2011-12.
 Use of $335,599 in General
Government Development Impact
Fees (fund 0-101), a portion of
which will be replaced through
additional Unclaimed Gas Tax over
the next three years.
Increased fees for services have been
implemented and will be revisited this fiscal
year. Unclaimed Gas Tax revenue is
expected to increase slightly, and Pesticide
Mill tax revenue is expected to remain flat.

General Fund provides 63% of the financing
for this budget and is reduced by $10,001
(6.9%) compared to FY 2011-12.
The recommended budget reflects the
elimination of a filled half-time (.50 FTE)
Office Assistant II position. In conjunction
with last year’s reduced support, the result is
the elimination of 33% of the clerical support
for the department over a two year period. In
addition, revenue from Yuba County has been
reduced compared to FY 2011-12 in order to
match the reduced funding from the Sutter
County General Fund.
The Bi-County Farm Advisor Department
expects that these reductions will have a
serious negative impact on its ability to
respond to clientele needs. Current University
of California Advisors and other Program
Delivery personnel will be required to assume
more of their own clerical responsibilities
instead of directly serving clientele through
research and program delivery activities. In
addition, the County staffing cuts will require
the office to be closed to the public from noon
to 1:00 pm each day in order to maintain a
consistent daily schedule of operation hours.
Federal and California State funding are both
significant and essential components of the
funding partnership of the UCCE Sutter/Yuba
office. While both of these entities and the
University of California continue to have
significant budget challenges, no significant
negative budgetary or program impacts on the
UCCE Sutter/Yuba office are anticipated for
FY 2012-13. In fact, UCCE is in the process of
prioritizing new academic positions for
allocation. The UCCE Sutter/Yuba office
County Director will be proposing new
university academic positions to address
critical local programmatic issues. However,
the Director reports that the level of county
support may be inadequate to justify the
positions within the UC system. Reductions in
County support will limit the County
Director’s ability to compete with other UCCE
county offices for additional UC resources
(personnel and programs).

This budget is recommended at $1,130,534.
The General Fund provides 75% of the
financing for this budget and is reduced by
$98,827 (10.5%) compared to FY 2011-12.
The Library has responded to county budget
cuts over the last two years with deeper cuts
than were requested.
The recommended budget includes one
layoff, one retirement, and elimination of
Extra Help staff. This brings the total
unfunded or eliminated positions to 5.5
FTEs. With the retirement of the half-time
(.50 FTE) Library Technician, the number
of unfunded positions increases from 4 in
FY 2011-12 to 4.5. This budget carries
forward the unfunded positions from FY
2011-12 which include: one (1 FTE) Library
Services Coordinator, one (1 FTE)
Supervising Library Technician, two halftime
(1.0 FTE) Library Technician and one
(1 FTE) Library Assistant I.
Other reductions in the recommended
budget include:
 The computer replacement plan is
eliminated;
 Library Office Expenses are reduced
by 50%;
 Collection Development (book
purchases) is reduced 43%. For
borrowers, this means there will be
65% fewer new titles on the shelves
compared to FY 2010-11.
Because of the reduction in Permanent and
Extra Help staff, the library will be forced to
reduce hours at all locations, including the
closure of the Browns and Pleasant Grove
Branches. Both of these branches reside at
schools. The majority of the collection and
furnishings will remain for continued use by
the school. The branches will no longer be
staffed by Sutter County employees.
The FY 2012-13 State budget eliminates all
Transaction Based Reimbursement funding.
In the past, these funds were used to offset
the costs of sharing materials with other
libraries and inter-library loans. The
NorthNet Library System which has
supplied delivery of loaned materials is also
struggling due to state cuts.
In addition to state budget cuts, Sutter
County Library may also be affected by
financial challenges at the Sacramento
Public Library (SPL) which hosts the
library’s Internet and Integrated Library
System.
Additional reductions to the Sutter County
Library Budget beyond the recommended
level would result in additional staff
reductions as well as further reduction in
Library hours.
The cost to maintain current hours at the
main library and all branches would require
$44,000 to reinstate Extra Help and $38,000
to reinstate the eliminated half-time (.50
FTE) Library Technician position for a total
of $82,000.
This budget is recommended at $150,464.
The General Fund provides 87% of the
financing for this budget and is reduced by
$16,735 (11.4 %) compared to FY 2011-12.
The recommended budget reflects a
reduction of regular staff hours, which will
necessitate reducing hours open to the public
by a total of eight hours per week. Extra
Help staffing hours, which are funded by the
Museum Commission have been reduced
from 700 hours to 450 hours per year. This
reduction will necessitate eliminating the
four hours the museum is open on Sunday,
limiting weekend visits to Saturday between
12:00 p.m. and 4:00 p.m. Some reduction in
attendance and donation opportunities may
be anticipated which could affect revenues;
however, every effort will be made to notify
patrons about the hours of operation
changes. Fewer local history exhibits and
programs would be presented based on less
available staff time and a reduction in the
number of research and educational
opportunities could occur. The backlog of
curatorial work would increase.
Revenue from the Museum Commission is
recommended at $20,213, a decrease of
$26,210 from last year’s recommended
revenue budget. Despite increased
fundraising efforts, the Museum
Commission was unable to meet its
projected contribution of $46,423. This was
partly due to the fact that Commission funds
had to be expended to furnish Ettl Hall with
tables, chairs and kitchen equipment to
prepare the hall for rental, and were not
contributed directly to the Museum.
Revenue from the rental of Ettl Hall was
estimated at $7,000 for FY 2011-12 and was
included in the reimbursement from the
Museum Commission. Once the building
was completed, all parties agreed to have the
Sutter County Public Works Department
manage the rental of the facility because it
manages the rental of the Veteran’s
Memorial Building and has staff in place. A
new budget unit was established (7-204) and
the Museum budget was adjusted, moving
the $7,000 revenue in the reimbursement
line item to an Intrafund transfer from the
Ettl Hall budget unit. The Intrafund revenue
shows as a negative expense in the Museum
budget. For FY 2012-13, the estimated
revenue coming to the Museum budget has
been increased to $14,000 in anticipation of
increased rentals. This represents one-half
of the rental income less actual costs
incurred for the rentals. The General Fund
covers any unreimbursed costs from the Ettl
Hall budget.
Additional reductions would compromise
the ability for the department to provide the
required services and could result in further
reduction in hours of operation. Therefore,
no further reductions are recommended at
this time.
This budget is recommended at $52,000 to
fund the County’s contribution to the
YSEDC. Funding for the Yuba-Sutter
Regional Arts Council is not recommended.
In FY 2011-12 a total of $72,000 was
appropriated for the following
organizations:
 YSEDC $52,000
 Family Soup $5,000
 Sutter County Resource
Conservation District $5,000
 The Acting Company $5,000
Yuba-Sutter Regional Arts Council
$5,000

This budget is recommended at $91,778. The
General Fund provides 100% of the financing
for Sutter County’s share of the Veteran’s
Services Officer budget and remains
unchanged compared to FY 2011-12.
This recommendation reflects only Sutter
County’s net share of cost.
This budget unit is based on a Bi-County
agreement and any additional reductions
would have to be negotiated with Yuba
County.

This budget is recommended at $104,769
after offsetting Intrafund Administration
Service reimbursements are considered. The
budget is $854,769 prior to application of
intra-departmental reimbursements of
$750,000 from Community Services
Divisions. The General Fund provides 10%
of the financing for this budget unit when
Interfund revenues are considered and is
reduced by $184,256 (95%) compared to FY
2011-12.
The recommended budget includes the
elimination of two filled positions: one
Assistant Director and one Office Assistant
III. It is also recommended that the ASO be
temporarily reassigned and related costs be
allocated to the Animal Control budget unit
(2-726).
The recommended FY 2012-13 Budget
therefore reflects salaries and benefits
reductions of $287,067 in the
Administration Budget unit compared to FY
2011-12. The budget for FY 2011-12
included salary savings for holding the
Director position vacant for 6 months, so the
relative savings in FY 2012-13 appears to be
less than would be recognized had the
Director position been fully funded in FY
2011-12.
A share of the recommended reduction is
spread to the other budget units within the
Community Services Department, shown in
a reduction to the Intrafund Admin Services
account of approximately $70,000.
The ASO position reallocation is included as
part of the recommended reduction.
However, for FY 2012-13, the cost is merely
shifted to the Animal Control budget unit (2-
726) which limits the Sutter County General
Fund responsibility to 25% (approximately
$30,836). The ASO is assigned to the
Animal Control budget unit for one fiscal
year or until such time that Yuba City takes
over as lead agency for the JPA. In FY
2013-14 the fully-burdened ASO’s salary
and benefits will return to the
Administration Budget, thereby reducing the
long-term General Fund savings.
The Community Services Department as a
whole has reduced its budget by $337,814
(12%) as compared to FY 2011-12

This budget is recommended at $526,609 and
includes Intrafund Administration Service
charges from the Community Services
Administration budget unit (2-721). The
General Fund provides 45% of the financing
for this budget unit and is reduced by $51,408
(18%) compared to FY 2011-12.
Other Pay is reduced over FY 2011-12 by
$30,988 related to a leave balance payout for a
retirement in the prior year. It is also
recommended Extra Help be increased by
$7,000 to assist with coverage during vacations
and sick leave.
The budget reflects an increase in Professional
and Specialized services for Chief Building
Official consultation when necessary.
Intrafund Administration Service charges are
recommended at $223,000; which is an
increase of $33,000 compared to FY 2011-12.
The majority of the administrative costs cover
Permit Technician’s time spent support of the
Building Division.

This budget is recommended at $845,226
and includes Intrafund Administration
Service charges from the Community
Services Administration budget unit (2-721).
This budget unit does not receive any
funding from the General Fund. The net
cost of this budget unit is covered by permits
and an Interfund transfer from the Public
Health Department.
The recommended budget reflects a 5.9%
decrease in the Net budget as compared to
FY 2011-12. However, due to an estimated
increase in permit revenue, the portion of the
budget estimated to be covered by the
Health Department is reduced 11%
compared to FY 2011-12.
Intrafund Administration Services charges
are recommended at $200,000 which is
unchanged compared to FY 2011-12. The
majority of the Administrative costs cover
Permit Technician’s and Office Assistant’s
time spent in support of the Environmental
Health Division.
Additional reductions would require
reductions in personnel which would reduce
the ability of the Division to provide
required services. Therefore, no further
reductions are recommended at this time.

This budget is recommended at $339,299
and includes Intrafund CUPA-EH charges
for services provided from the
Environmental Health Budget unit (2-725).
This budget unit does not receive any
funding from the General Fund. The net
cost of this budget unit is covered by permits
and grants.
The recommended budget reflects a $75,140
(28.4%) increase in the Net Budget as
compared to FY 2011-12. This is directly
related to the increase in State grant funding
for the software implementation program.
In FY 2011-12, using grant funds received
mid-year, a new vehicle was purchased.
The FY 2012-13 budget includes increased
expenses related to that purchase.
During FY 2011-12, a grant was received to
assist with the implementation of new
software. This project is ongoing, and
increased expenses in Professional/
Specialized Services and Office Equipment
are budgeted in FY 2012-13 to complete the
project.
Intrafund CUPA-EH, which represents the
charges for services provided by the
Environmental Health budget unit (2-725),
is budgeted at $270,000, which is an
increase of $49,393 (23%) compared to FY
2011-12. This is related to the software
implementation project.
Hazardous Materials Fees are projected to
decrease by 6.4% ($11,243) however State
Grant funds are projected to increase 97.2%
($86,383).

This budget is recommended at $1,143,514
and includes Intrafund Administration
Service charges from the Community
Services Administration budget unit (2-721).
The General Fund provides 21% of the
financing for this budget unit and is
increased by $29,677 (14.4%) compared to
FY 2011-12.
The recommended budget includes the
addition of costs for the ASO position to
function as an onsite Division manager.

Intrafund Plant Acquisition costs are
budgeted at zero, reflecting a $140,000
reduction compared to FY 2011-12. This
reduction is related to facility improvement
costs in the prior year.
Intrafund Administration Services charges
are recommended at $57,000 which is a
reduction of $38,000 (40%) compared to FY
2011-12. The administrative costs include
the Executive Secretary acting as support
staff for the SASA Board of Directors and
the Director of Community Services’ time
spent in support of the Animal Control
Division.
The recommended budget includes $80,000
budgeted in Appropriation for Contingency.
These funds are a placeholder for potential
costs associated with the future
implementation of a shelter medicine
program. The SASA Board of Directors
must approve the program and the use of
these funds.
The SASA Board of Directors has approved
this preliminary budget and each of the three
jurisdictions has appropriated funds per the
approved cost sharing formula.

This budget is recommended at $691,916.
This budget unit does not receive any
funding from the General Fund. All funding
is provided through property taxes and
interest.
The recommended budget includes a
decrease of the pass-through funds due to an
anticipated 2% reduction in county-wide
property taxes.

This budget is recommended at $2,157,558
and is reduced 4.4% compared to FY 2011-
12. This budget unit does not receive any
funding from the General Fund. All funding
is provided through property taxes and
interest.
Capital Assets is recommended at $10,000
for the purchase of a fuel con vault for diesel
fuel storage.

This budget is recommended at $193,500.
This budget unit does not receive any
funding from the General Fund. All funding
is provided through property taxes and
interest.

This budget is recommended at $258,300.
This budget unit does not receive any
funding from the General Fund. All funding
is provided through property taxes and
interest.

This budget is recommended at $413,800 and
includes Interfund Administration-Misc. Dept.
charges from the Community Services
Administration budget unit (2-721). The
General Fund provides 29% of the financing
for this budget unit and is increased by $1,347
(1.2%) compared to FY 2011-12.

The recommended budget reflects the transfer
of 10% of the PIO position from the County
Administrator’s budget unit (1-102) to reflect
time spent assisting the Emergency Services
Manager and to take advantage of grant
reimbursements for that time.
Interfund Administration – Misc. Dept.
charges are recommended at $36,500, which
is an increase of $6,500 (12%) compared to
FY 2011-12. The administrative costs include
front office staff and the Director of
Community Services’ time spent in support of
the Emergency Services Division.
The recommended budget includes rebudgeted
expenses and revenues for the
previous years (2010 and 2011) Homeland
Security grants reflecting funds not spent prior
to the end of FY 2011-12.

This budget unit is recommended at
$282,075 and includes Interfund
Administration – Misc. Department charges
from the Community Services
Administration budget unit (2-721). The
General Fund provides 99% of the financing
for this budget unit and is decreased by
$5,404 (1.9%) compared to FY 2011-12.

Interfund Administration – Misc. Dept.
charges are recommended at $58,500, which
is an increase of $23,500 compared to FY
2011-12. The administrative costs include
front office staff and the Director of
Community Services’ time spent in support
of Fire Services.
Additional reductions would compromise
the ability of the Department to provide the
required services. Therefore, no further
reductions are recommended at this time.
This budget is recommended at $2,570,481
and includes Intrafund Administration
Service charges from the Community
Services Administration budget unit (2-721).
The General Fund provides 46% of the
financing for this budget unit and is reduced

by $63,310 (5.1%) compared to FY 2011-
12.
The recommended budget includes the
elimination of one vacant Assistant Planner
position and one unfunded Senior Planner
position, reducing total staff to 6 FTEs from
8 in FY 2011-12.
Professional & Specialized Services
includes $100,000 for the first year of a twoyear
contract to update the Zoning Code in
relation to the newly adopted General Plan.
It also includes $29,000 for an update to
Sutter County’s Housing Element which is
due to be completed during FY 2013-14. In
addition, this budget includes $35,000 to
update the County’s impact fees to
correspond to the newly adopted General
Plan.
Intrafund Administration Services charges
are recommended at $200,000 which is a
reduction of $65,000 compared to FY 2011-
12. The majority of the administrative costs
cover Permit Technician’s and Office
Assistant’s time spent in support of the
Building Division.
--------------------
This budget is recommended at $2,179,512.
The General Fund provides 93.0% of the
financing for this budget unit, and is reduced
by $54,667 (2.6%) compared to FY 2011-
12. A portion of the costs for this budget
unit are recouped from user pay revenues.
The recommended budget includes salary
and benefit reductions of $69,639, reflecting
a 5% voluntary furlough for all positions in
the Assessor’s office for FY 2012-13.
The Interfund Information Technology
charge is recommended at $203,835, an
increase of $39,911, due primarily to
recommended changes in the Information
Technology Department budget.
User pay revenues are recommended to
increase by $16,000 based on a review of
actual, historic receipts.
An Interfund Transfer-In of $131,450 is again
recommended from the State-County Property
Tax Program special revenue fund (0-181).
The funds in this special revenue fund reflect
the remaining balance of funds received under
the State’s former State-County Property Tax
Administration Grant Program, which was
eliminated by the State Legislature in FY
2006-07. This funding source previously
provided additional revenue to augment
staffing and for the acquisition of new
equipment and technology necessary to
enhance staff proficiency and productivity and
to eliminate backlogs. In order to sustain
present staffing, operational levels, and output,
one-third of the FY 2010-11 balance of the
fund ($131,450) has been budgeted for the past
two years to help offset the operational costs of
the Assessor’s office.
In FY 2011-12, the Assessor was able to
achieve a net budget reduction of 13%. Two
filled positions were eliminated in FY 2011-
12 (one Auditor-Appraiser I/II/III and one
Assessment Technician I/II/III).
Additionally, the Assistant Assessor position
was defunded and will continue to be held
vacant and unfunded during FY 2012-13.
As stated in the Program Discussion section,
the Assessor’s workload in the real property
division has increased by 30% at the same
time that the County is making staffing
reductions. The effects of the eliminated
and vacant/unfunded positions have been a
reduction in processing capacity. Additional
reductions would require the elimination of
an additional filled position, limiting the
office’s ability to meet legal requirements
and would begin to significantly impact
revenue generating activities of the office.
Therefore, further reductions are not
recommended at this time.

This budget is recommended at $1,366,694.
The General Fund provides 99.8% of the
financing for this budget unit and is reduced
by $63,140 (4.4%) compared to FY 2011-
12.
This budget recommendation includes the
elimination of one filled Account Clerk III
position, resulting in a budget reduction of
$65,110. The Auditor-Controller’s Office is
currently staffed with three Account Clerk II
positions. As reported by the Auditor-
Controller, one Account Clerk III position is
serving in the executive management and
supervision arena, working as an Executive
Secretary I. (The Executive Secretary
position in the Auditor-Controller’s Office
was eliminated in the FY 2011-12 Adopted
Budget. As was reported by the Auditor-
Controller in 2010, this position provided
secretarial support for executive
management and office staff.)
Extra Help is recommended at $7,980 to
fund 550 hours of an Account Clerk I
position, to perform data entry duties which
had been previously performed by the
Computer Operator in the Information
Technology Department. Because the
Computer Operator position remains
defunded and will continue to be held
vacant, this recommendation reflects these
duties being performed by the Auditor-
Controller’s Office with a respective
increase in Extra Help hours. The inclusion
of Extra Help funding for data entry duties is
a repeat of a prior year recommendation,
with the exception that the recommended
funding level is based on the Auditor hiring
at the Account Clerk I level for data entry
work, rather than the higher Account Clerk
III level.
In prior years, the Auditor-Controller had
requested and the CAO had recommended a
limited amount of Extra Help funding for
assistance during peak workload periods,
such as year-end. Extra Help funding for
this purpose was eliminated from the
Auditor-Controller’s request for FY 2012-13
as a means of achieving additional budget
savings. The recommended budget
maintains the $5,000 standard appropriation
for Overtime for the purposes of supporting
additional work hours during peak workload
periods.
The budget recommendation provides
$17,000 in Professional and Specialized
Services to cover temporary payroll
assistance for two months until the SunGard
system can “go live” (estimated to take
place in early FY 2012-13).
The budget recommendation also includes
$6,400 for Auditor-Controller staff to attend
SunGard training sessions. Much of these
costs will be charged out to departments and
will eventually be reimbursed through the
A-87 cost plan.
For the 7th year in a row, the Auditor-
Controller has requested funding ($500,000)
for reimbursement of legal fees and for ongoing legal representation. This amount has
not been included in the Recommended
Budget. The Board has repeatedly turned
down the Auditor’s request for
reimbursement of legal expenses ($460,000)
related to the defense of the Auditor-
Controller and Assistant Auditor-Controller
against their indictments. The remaining
$40,000 was intended for outside counsel to
respond to business-related legal questions
the Auditor may have.
Reductions totaling $450 are also
recommended in the Communications and
Maintenance of Equipment line items for FY
2012-13 in an effort to further reduce costs
in recognition of reduced countywide
financing.

The General Fund provides 100% of the
financing for this budget unit and is reduced
$36,635 (9.2%) compared to FY 2011-12.
The FY 2011-12 Recommended Budget
reflects a decrease in the Interfund Liability
Insurance Premium account based on
allocated costs provided by Risk
Management.

This budget is recommended at $188,751.
The General Fund provides 99.8% of the
financing for this budget unit and is reduced
by $6,585 (3.4%) compared to FY 2011-12.
Salaries and related benefits have been
reduced by $8,953 for FY 2012-13. A
portion of this reduction is due to the
reclassification of the Staff Analyst position
to an Accountant I position, approved in FY
2011-12. Additionally, to create additional
budget savings in FY 2012-13, the Clerk-
Recorder will leave temporarily reduce this
position to a 60% level. The Clerk-Recorder
Department’s positions have historically
been allocated across multiple budget units
within the Department. Five percent of the
position is budgeted in the Clerk of the
Board budget unit; therefore, five percent of
the savings is reflected here. Additional
reductions are due to general salary and
benefit adjustments.
Due to the limited size of the Clerk of the
Board budget, any reduction to the budget
would necessitate a reduction in staffing. A
reduction in staffing would inhibit the
County’s ability to meet legal requirements
regarding regular business and meetings of the
Board of Supervisors. Staff reductions in this
budget would also affect official recordkeeping
efforts. Therefore, reductions are not
recommended.
This budget is recommended at $753,930.
The General Fund provides 91% of the
financing for this budget unit and is reduced
by $53,174 (7.2%) compared to FY 2011-
12.
Previous budgets have included funding for
smaller, less frequent landowner and utility
district elections. This budget does not
include funding for these elections. In the
event an election is called, such as a Special
Election, a budget amendment requiring
Board action would be required. If one of
these elections is called, it would be
reimbursed by the entity requiring the
election.
Salaries and related benefits have been
reduced by $28,036 for FY 2012-13. A
reduction of approximately $16,400 was due
to the reclassification of the Staff Analyst
position to an Accountant I position,
approved in FY 2011-12. The Elections
budget unit’s share of this savings is
approximately $9,020. Additionally, to
create additional budget savings in FY 2012-
13, the Clerk-Recorder will reduce this
position to a 60% level. This temporary
change results in a net reduction of $12,327
in the Elections budget. The Clerk-Recorder
Department’s positions have historically
been allocated across multiple budget units
within the Department. Fifty-five percent of
the position is budgeted in the Elections
budget unit; therefore, fifty-five percent of
the savings is reflected here. Additional
reductions are due to general salary and
benefit adjustments.
As previously mentioned, elections
conducted on behalf of other entities such as
city and school districts are reimbursable.
Therefore, an increase in Elections Services
revenue is budgeted for the 2012-13 fiscal
year. A decrease in Candidate Filling Fee
revenues is budgeted as the cities perform
the candidate filings for the city council
contests.
Cost savings measures have been the focus of
Elections for the past few years. A
combination of continued streamlining of
processes, printing reductions, Extra Help
reductions (in non-election years) and
implementation of new Elections regulations
have led to decreases in overall cost of
conducting elections.
Additional reductions to the Elections budget
would require the elimination of filled
positions, because the County is mandated to
cover the cost of the Primary Election. Staff
reductions in the Elections office would
hamper the office’s ability to meet legal
requirements and could compromise the ability
for the County to administer a legal election.
Therefore, further reductions are not
recommended.

This budget is recommended at $476,099.
The General Fund provides 5.8% of the
financing for this budget unit and is reduced
by $27,371 (49.6%) compared to FY 2011-
12.
Salaries and related benefits have been
reduced by $25,721 for FY 2012-13. A
reduction of approximately $16,400 is due
to the reclassification of the Staff Analyst
position to an Accountant I position,
approved in FY 2011-12. Additionally, to
create additional budget savings in FY 2012-
13, the Clerk-Recorder will reduce this
position to a 60% position for FY 2012-13.
This temporary change results in a net
reduction is $9,321 in the Recorder budget.
The Clerk-Recorder Department’s positions
have historically been allocated across
multiple budget units within the Department.
Thirty percent of the position is budgeted in
the Recorder budget unit; therefore, thirty
percent of the savings is reflected here.
Computer Hardware is recommended at
$15,000 to fund replacement computer servers
for the storage of electronic images of records.
This expense is funded by the Recorder
Upgrade special revenue fund (0-232).
An additional $13,000 is recommended for
Professional and Specialized Services to fund a
service that will simultaneously perform the
conversion of microfilm images to electronic
images and redact social security numbers
from those records. This service is funded by
the Recorder Upgrade special revenue fund (0-
232) and the Social Security Truncation
Program special revenue fund (0-280).
The recommended budget maintains one
frozen and unfunded Deputy Clerk-Recorder
position, which was defunded in FY 2011-
12. Additionally, one vacant Deputy Clerk-
Recorder was permanently deleted in FY
2011-12.
Continuation of reduced staffing may
require that members of the public
experience longer service waiting times.
Greater service impacts should be expected
if recording activity increases in the coming
year. Additionally, reduced staffing
decreases the Department’s ability to
perform special project work related to
funding from the Department’s special
revenue funds. Because recording activity
and service requests from members of the
public will be addressed first, these projects,
such as the truncation of social security
numbers from previously recorded
documents, will continue to be performed as
staff is available.
Additional reductions would require the
elimination of an additional filled position,
limiting the office’s ability to meet legal
requirements regarding recording of
documents and would significantly
compromise the Department’s ability to

provide services to the public. Therefore,
further reductions are not recommended.

This budget is recommended at $214,184.
The General Fund provides 50% of the
financing for this budget unit and is reduced
by $19,516 (15.4%) compared to FY 2011-
12.
Salaries and related benefits have been
reduced by $4,898 for FY 2012-13. A
portion of this reduction is due to the
reclassification of the Staff Analyst position
to an Accountant I position, approved in FY
2011-12. Additionally, to create additional
budget savings in FY 2012-13, the Clerk-
Recorder will reduce this position to a 60%
position for FY 2012-13. The Clerk-
Recorder Department’s positions have
historically been allocated across multiple
budget units within the Department. Ten
percent of the position is budgeted in the
County Clerk budget unit; therefore, ten
percent of the savings is reflected here.
The recommended budget maintains one
frozen and unfunded Deputy Clerk-Recorder
position, which was defunded in FY 2011-
12. Additionally, one vacant Deputy Clerk-
Recorder was permanently deleted in FY
2011-12.
Additional reductions would require the
elimination of an additional filled position,
limiting the office’s ability to meet legal
requirements regarding recording of
documents and would significantly
compromise the department’s ability to
provide services to the public. Therefore,
further reductions are not recommended.

The budget is recommended at $1,095,791.
The General Fund provides 99.6% of the
financing for this budget unit, and is reduced
by $4,366 (0.4%) compared to FY 2011-12.
A portion of the costs for this budget unit
are recouped from the Local Agency
Formations Commission for staff support,
and through the annual A-87 cost plan.
The budget includes a recommendation to
eliminate the filled Executive Secretary
position, in an effort to restructure the
workload of the County Administrative
Office and in light of reduced countywide
financing available. The Executive
Secretary position provides secretarial

support for executive management and
office staff, as well as assisting members of
the public and representatives from County
departments. The duties of the Executive
Secretary will be reassigned to remaining
staff.
The five professional staff within the County
Administrative Office agreed to take a
voluntary 5% furlough during FY 2011-12,
resulting in a reduction of $44,223 in
budgeted Salaries & Benefits expenses. Full
funding for these positions has been restored
for FY 2012-13.
The recommended budget maintains the
Senior Analyst position as vacant and
unfunded. This position was first left vacant
and unfunded in FY 2010-11.
Salary and benefit expenses have been
decreased due to the transfer of 10% of the
Public Information Officer (PIO) position to
the Emergency Services budget unit (2-401)
reflecting time spent by the PIO on
Emergency Services projects. The
Emergency Services budget will show an
increase of $11,578, which will be offset
with grant funds.
This budget recommendation also includes
reductions to several remaining services and
supplies accounts for FY 2012-13 in an
effort to further reduce costs in recognition
of reduced countywide financing. These
total a reduction of $1,800.
On March 31, 2009, the Board of
Supervisors approved a contract with
SunGard Public Sector, Inc., to implement a
new software system for Personnel, Payroll,
Purchasing, and Budgeting. The Personnel
and Payroll modules are currently scheduled
to be implemented in September of 2012.
The Recommended Budget includes a rebudget
of $30,000 for one extra-help
position to assist regular staff during the
implementation of the budget module, which
has been deferred for over two years
pending completion of the Personnel and
Payroll modules.
Due to the limited size of the budget for the
County Administrative Office, additional
reductions would necessitate the elimination of
a filled position. This would be in addition to
the Executive Secretary position which is
slated for elimination in the Recommended
Budget and the Senior Analyst position that is
currently being held vacant and unfunded.
Further staff reductions would limit the
office’s ability to meet requirements of the
office, including legal requirements such as the
preparation of the annual Recommended
Budget and responses to Public Records Act
requests. Further reductions are not
recommended at this time.
This budget is recommended at $1,107,483.
The General Fund provides 96.8% of the
financing for this budget unit and is reduced
by $3,799 (0.4%) compared to FY 2011-12.
A portion of the costs for this budget unit
are recouped from outside and subvented
funds through the annual A-87 cost plan.
The Board of Supervisors approved a minor,
temporary reorganization of the Department
in February of 2012. An existing Deputy
County Counsel IV has been temporarily
Counsel position, the vacated Deputy
County Counsel IV position will be
defunded temporarily, and a new Limited
Term Deputy County Counsel I position was
approved for a term of one year. The cost
savings in FY 2012-13 associated with this
reorganization is estimated at $66,707.
Additionally, the budget returns funding for
two months of the Assistant County Counsel
position, which had been partially defunded
in FY 2011-12 to reflect the anticipated unpaid
status of the incumbent. At that time,
$15,240 was added to the Professional and
Specialized Services account to allow the
Department to contract for additional
counsel services to help offset the vacant
position. The additional funding in
Professional and Specialized Services has
been removed for FY 2012-13. The cost
increase for adding back the two months of
funding for the Assistant County Counsel
position in FY 2012-13, offset by the
reduction in Professional and Specialized
Services, is estimated at $11,920.
The recommended budget maintains major
prior year reductions in the following
accounts:
 Subscriptions and Publications,
maintained at $28,000. Law Research
contracts and subscriptions were
reduced in the prior two years. The
Department maintains only one legal
resource subscription, and is using
internet-based research to the extent
possible.
 Professional and Specialized Services,
maintained at $6,000. It should be
noted that additional appropriations
will be required for outside counsel in
the event that larger cases arise which
would exceed the capacity of the
Department.
 Transportation and Travel, maintained
at $6,000. The Department must keep
a minimum appropriation for
Transportation and Travel for
professional staff to attend trainings
where they receive continuing
education credits, as this is the most
economical means to meet licensing
requirements.
The impact of these reductions will need to
be monitored during the year and will be
reevaluated for FY 2013-14.
The County Counsel Department is
relatively small, staffed by the County
Counsel, an Assistant County Counsel and
three Deputy County Counsels, plus one
full-time Administrative Assistant and one
part-time Legal Secretary. Further budget
reductions in the County Counsel
department would, depending on the desired
reduction amount, require the reduction of at
least one professional position and would
result in a commensurate reduction in legal
services available to the Board of
Supervisors and County departments.
Therefore, no further reductions are
recommended in this budget unit.

The recommended revenue is $2,667,905,
which is a decrease of $852,907 (24.2%)
compared to FY 2011-12. This decrease is
due primarily to unreimbursed cost decreases
in the Welfare Administration (5-101),
Temporary Aid for Needy Families (5-204)
and In-Home Supportive Services (5-201)
budget units. The decrease in In-Home
Supportive Services unreimbursed cost is
simply a change in budgeting to directly
reflect the required revenue transferred into

the budget unit from the Social Services
Realignment Fund (0-248)
The recommended amount for the sales tax
portion of the Social Services Realignment
Revenues (SSRR), which, by statute, is first
deposited to the Welfare/Social Services
Realignment Fund (Fund 0-248), is
recommended at $2,042,246. This is a
decrease of $854,566 (29.5%) and is also
directly attributable to the decrease in
unreimbursed cost of the budget units within
the Welfare/Social Services fund.
The recommended budget for the MVIL
portion of the SSRR is $175,000, the same as
budgeted in FY 2011-12. The Motor Vehicle
In-lieu (MVIL) portion of the SSRR is first
deposited in the General Fund and is then
transferred to this budget unit.
The SSRR amounts are set each year by the
State Controller’s Office. It should be noted
these budgeted figures are subject to change
once revenue estimate information becomes
available from the State Controller’s office
later in the year.

This budget is recommended at $105,429.
It is recommended that the costs associated
with this budget unit be funded with a
Cancellation of Obligated Fund Balance, from
the Committed Fund Balance Designated for
Capital Projects (account #31265).
This budget is recommended at $38,538.
The General Fund does not provide any
financing for this budget unit.

The Contributions to Others account is
recommended at $38,538, based on
estimated funding available in the fund, in
order to refund the bond. Actual funds
available will not be known until the close
of the FY 2011-12 accounting books. The
Treasurer - Tax Collector will bring a
recommendation to the Board of Supervisors
to redeem the bond issuance and to close
the fund in FY 2012-13.

This budget is recommended at $953,720.
The General Fund provides 62.1% of the
financing for this budget unit and is
increased by $40,655 (7.4%) compared to
FY 2011-12.
This recommendation reflects a $13,922
decrease in salary and benefit costs due to
the retirement of one long-time County
employee with a new employee entering
service at a lower level salary step and under
the lower retirement plan. Because onethird
of this position is budgeted in the ORC
budget unit, that budget unit will also reflect
a relative savings.
This budget maintains the prior year
reduction of one full-time Treasurer-Deputy
Collector position to a 50% (0.5 FTE)
position. The Department will also continue
to hold vacant and unfunded one Treasurer-
Deputy Collector position that was frozen
and unfunded in FY 2009-10. It should be
noted that if a significant delay in processing
of payments occurs, this could result in a
loss of investment revenue, as those delayed
payments would not be immediately
available for investment.
A reduction of $3,000 is recommended in
Office Expense based on a review of prior
year actual expenditures.
The Interfund Information Technology
charge is recommended at $183,773, an
increase of $70,580, due primarily to
recommended changes in the Information
Technology Department budget. These
costs are also impacted by the Department’s
efforts to modernize operations and increase
efficiency, efforts which require Information
Technology Department services.

Additional reductions would require the
elimination of an additional filled position,
limiting the office’s ability to meet legal
requirements regarding hours of operation
(the Tax Collector is required to remain
open until 5 pm). Further staffing
reductions would also lead to longer delays
in processing of payments. Therefore,
further reductions are not recommended at
this time.
Major projects and policy issues for this
budget unit in the upcoming year will be to
continue the efforts in applying modern
technology necessary to stay current with
subsequent property tax billings and
collections and for the convenience of our
citizens.

This budget is recommended at $214,228.
The General Fund provides 49.8% of the
financing for this budget unit and is reduced
$8,295 (7.2%) compared to FY 2011-12.
The budget includes $21,525 in Software
License and Maintenance to fund the
Department’s collection enhancement
software system. Computer Hardware is
recommended at $1,500 for the purchase of
a high capacity printer for collection
enhancement. An increase of $18,253 is
recommended in the Interfund Transfer-In
from the ORC Collections special revenue
fund (0-243). Increased funding is intended
to offset costs associated with administering
Office of Revenue Collections programs and
will offset the Software License and
Maintenance and Computer Hardware
expenses.
The recommended budget maintains prior
years’ reductions in Transportation and
Travel, Communications, Maintenance of
Equipment and Professional and Specialized
Services expenses. These reductions are
made in an effort to reduce County costs for
FY 2012-13. Cost reductions will be reevaluated
for FY 2014-15.
The Office of Revenue Collections division
is currently staffed by two Treasurer-
Collector Deputy positions, and is allocated
a portion of the Assistant Treasurer-Tax
Collector position for management
oversight. In FY 2012-13, the department
will continue to hold vacant and unfunded a
third Treasurer-Deputy Collector position
that was frozen and unfunded in FY 2010-
11.

This budget is recommended at $426,160,
which is a decrease of $33,068 (7.2%)
compared to FY 2011-12. It is
recommended to continue to leave the
Administrative Services Manager position
vacant and unfunded. Extra Help funding is
recommended at $3,000, which is 50% of
the amount budgeted in FY 2011-12, in the
event additional administrative assistance is
required.
The $69,888 unreimbursed cost, which is
decreased by $23,995 (25.6%) over FY
2011-12, represents the Health Department's
share of the Human Services-Administration
budget. This Unreimbursed Cost is, in
concept, partially funded by the General
Fund through the General Fund’s
contribution to the Health Fund.

This budget is recommended at $6,153,155
with a net unreimbursed cost of $2,896,375,
which is a decrease of $458,504 (13.7%)
compared to FY 2011-12.
The Wellness Program within the Health
budget unit is recommended for elimination.
This results in an unreimbursed cost savings of
$57,883. The program provides benefits to
County employees such as entry fees for 5K
runs and various other healthful activities.
However, the County’s current health
insurance provider, Tri-County Schools
Insurance Group (TCSIG), now offers many
wellness activities free of charge. Employees
wishing to continue to participate in wellness
activities will be encouraged to take advantage
of programs offered by TCSIG.
The County has a Maintenance of Effort
(MOE), or minimum funding requirement, as a
condition of receiving 1991 Realignment
funding from the State. Sutter County’s MOE
is $674,240. The recommended budget overmatches
the MOE by approximately $189,299,
which is a reduction of $233,599 (55.2%)
compared to the FY 2011-12 Adopted Budget.
Of the 58.73 FTE positions contained in the
Health Department budget, 1.5 FTE positions
are contracted to PeachTree Clinic, while
29.68 FTE positions are grant funded. The
positions that are contracted to PeachTree
Clinic and positions that are grant funded have
no General Fund cost.

This budget is recommended at $800,965, with
a net unreimbursed cost of $777,247, which is
a decrease of $63,460 (7.5%) compared to FY
2011-12.
The County is currently in a multi-year
contract with Bi-County Ambulance Services
for indigent medical transportation. The
annual cost for these services is $26,400.
The County Share in the EMS Agency is
recommended at $52,750. The anticipated
cost for participation in this joint powers
agreement is based on California State
Department of Finance projections for the
population of Sutter County.
This budget contains the participation fee
($188,781) set by legislation for the County to
participate in the CMSP.
The budget also includes $533,034 to be
transferred to the Environmental Health budget
unit, as Environmental Health service is part of
the County’s required health care Maintenance
of Effort. The recommended amount
represents a reduction of $52,775 compared to
the FY 2011-12 Adopted Budget.

This budget is recommended at $274,868,
which is an increase of $1,500 (0.5%)
compared to FY 2011-12. This budget unit
does not receive any financing from the
General Fund. The County’s share of cost is
met by a transfer of Welfare/Social Services
1991 Realignment funding.
At this time, the State has not determined the
amount of its contribution to the Sutter
County CCS Program in FY 2012-13. As
mentioned above, in the past, as a policy item,
the County has budgeted an amount in excess
of the MOE in order to meet the potential
demand for service, which can be very
volatile. This budget request for $210,368 is
consistent with the Board of Supervisors’ past
policy in this area and is the same as the prior
year’s Adopted Budget. However, the Board
could opt to reduce this budget request to the
minimum MOE of $154,465, to match a
potential reduced State contribution. At this
time it is unknown whether the State contribution will match the amount
appropriated over the MOE.

This budget is recommended at $2,085,713,
which is an increase of $464,054 (28.6%)
compared to FY 2011-12. Jail Medical
Services are 100% funded by the General
Fund.
It is recommended that two (2.0 FTE)
Supervising Registered Nurse positions be
added to the budget. Therefore, Salaries and
related benefits are recommended to increase
by $235,598. As stated above, the addition of
two permanent Registered Nurse positions
will reduce overtime required by regular
staff, will reduce the use of Extra Help
staffing, and will reduce the need to rely on
outside contract staff. Extra Help is
recommended to decrease by $16,130, and
additional funding for contract staffing has
been removed from the budget.
Support & Care of Persons expense reflects
direct expenditures related to the
hospitalizations and other outside care of
inmates. This line item has increased
significantly during FY 2011-12, and is
recommended at $530,000. This reflects an
increase of $210,000, or 65%, over the FY
2011-12 Adopted Budget. These expenditures
will be monitored closely over the coming
year.
Medical Dental Lab Supplies costs are also
recommended to increase $30,000, or 18%,
over the prior year, based on expenditure trend.
The cost of providing medical services to the
Sutter County Jail is, in effect, transferred to
the Jail budget unit (2-301), within the Public
Safety fund (0015), through the recording of
an Interfund Jail Medical transfer. This
transfer essentially transfers the unreimbursed
cost of the Jail Medical Services program from
the Health Fund to the Public Safety fund. The
General Fund covers all unreimbursed costs in
the Public Safety fund.

$23,524,688, which is an increase of
$2,881,805 (14.0%) compared to FY 2011-
12. Most of this increase is due to 2011
Realignment. This budget unit receives no
financing from the General Fund.
SYMHS’ rates are required by federal law to
be based on actual costs. Medi-Cal is billed
using estimated rates based on costs from a
prior year and these rates are then reconciled
to actual costs at the end of each fiscal year
through a cost report process. Reimbursements
to counties have been based on
statewide maximum allowable (SMA) rates
set by the California Department of Mental
Health (DMH). DMH has held the SMA
rates constant for several years for state
budgeting purposes, guaranteeing that counties’
mental health programs operate at a
loss when treating Medi-Cal beneficiaries.
To address this problem, the California
Department of Health Care Services has
negotiated a State Plan Amendment (SPA)
with the federal Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid Services (CMS) under which
counties will be reimbursed by the federal
government at the federal matching rate for
the difference between the SMA rates and
their published rates based on actual cost.
The SPA was approved for FY 2009-10 and
has been tentatively approved for FY 2010-
11. This new funding will be available upon
cost report settlement, typically two years or
more after expenses are incurred. The
process for claiming this reimbursement is
still under negotiation between the state and
federal governments.
For FY 2012-13, SYMHS will charge
$960.42 per day on the Inpatient Unit.
Other services are charged by the minute:
$7.29 per minute for Medication Support,
$3.06 per minute for Case Management/
Brokerage, $3.95 per minute for Mental
Health Services, and $5.87 per minute for
Crisis Intervention. These rates will be
adjusted upon completion of the FY 2010-11
Cost Report.
In addition to the above, the rate for the First
Steps perinatal substance abuse treatment
program will be $118.94 per day. Clients
will be charged for these and for other substance
abuse treatment services on a sliding
fee schedule based on ability to pay.
From a financial perspective, several factors
are affecting the FY 2012-13 Mental Health
budget.

Since FY 2003-04, both locally and
statewide, Mental Health Realignment
allocations have remained flat or declined.
Mental Health Realignment
(1991) revenue was originally based on
portions of sales taxes and motor vehicle
license fees but, with changes from 2011
Realignment, beginning in FY 2011-12
is based only on an increased portion of
sales tax revenue. For FY 2012-13
SYMHS’ budget assumes that this 1991
Realignment funding will remain flat.
The cost of doing business has continued
to increase. Even in more robust economic
times, statewide growth in Realignment
funding has gone to pay for increasing
caseloads in Child Welfare Services,
Foster Care, and/or In Home Supportive
Services, programs which, by
statute, have first draw on Realignment
growth dollars. The Mental Health Division
uses Realignment funding as match
to draw down the federal contributions
to Medi-Cal.
 For FY 2011-12, the state enacted legislation
(AB 100) that “redirected” a
state-wide total of $861 million in Mental
Health Services Act (MHSA) funds
to fund three traditional mental health
programs previously funded by the State
General Fund (SGF): Early and Periodic
Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment
(EPSDT), mental health managed care,
and mental health services for special
education students (formerly the AB
3632 mandate). For FY 2012-13, SGF
monies that previously funded EPSDT
and mental health managed care will be
replaced by 2011 Realignment sales tax
revenue. The services previously mandated
by AB 3632 are now the responsibility
of the schools.
 AOD funding has also remained flat or
declined slightly for the last several
years. Thus, as costs of doing business
have increased, staff costs in Drug and
Alcohol were reduced by leaving vacancies
unfilled. Some AOD programs and
funding will now be funded by sales taxes
under 2011 Realignment. New funding
under Criminal Justice Realignment
will add AOD programs at Probation.
Due to these fiscal challenges, for FY 2012-
13, the Division will continue to fill only
essential vacancies. Most vacant positions
were eliminated from this budget unit in the
final FY 2009-10 budget and additional
positions were unfunded in the FY 2011-12
budget. The complexity of mental health
and AOD funding and programs has increased
for a variety of reasons, including
2011 Realignment and major changes to
MHSA’s payment methodology. This added
complexity will require some added administrative
staff. As a start toward addressing
this serious problem, the CAO is recommending
that a vacant Account Clerk III
position be converted to an Accountant II
position, effective July 1, 2012. The addition
of accounting expertise will help the
Division cope with the many changes required
by the state. For FY 2012-13, no
Mental Health staff layoffs are being recommended
at this time.
It remains SYMHS’ objective to keep the
Mental Health budget and the Mental Health
Services Act budget in balance and to fully
utilize all available funding in a fashion
most advantageous to our counties.
The State’s practice of deferring payments
to counties as a means of addressing its
fiscal shortcomings continues to cause cash
flow problems for SYMHS. The Board of
Supervisors has assisted SYMHS in meeting
this difficult challenge by authorizing borrowing
from internal funds of the Human
Services Department. SYMHS pays interest
on these cash flow loans, but the State does
not pay interest on the payments it defers, so

an added cost is imposed on SYMHS as a
result.
An additional area of concern is the effect of
prior year audits. The State Department of
Mental Health Audit division is becoming
much more aggressive in their audit reviews.
Generally these audits occur between four
and five years after the year the services
were provided, which means that any error
that is discovered may have continued to be
made in the subsequent years. In effect, a
relatively minor error made in one year
could have a significant impact over time if
that error continued to be made in subsequent
years.

This budget is recommended at $8,542,535,
which is an increase of $1,307,762 (18.1%)
compared to FY 2011-12. This increase is
due primarily to the ongoing EHR project
expenses, which were initially approved
during FY 2011-12. These expenses are
funded by revenue from the State. This
budget unit receives no financing from the
General Fund.
MHSA is a volatile and economically sensitive
funding source. This funding has decreased
during the current economic downturn.
For FY 2012-13, hiring to fill vacant
positions will be limited. In this budget, the
CAO recommends restoring funding to one
vacant Resource Specialist position that was
unfunded in the FY 2011-12 budget. Experience
has shown this position is necessary
to provided job placement and coaching to
mental health clients. Restoration of funding
to this position should be effective as of
July 1, 2012.
The state has enacted legislation (AB 100)
that “redirected” a state-wide total of $861
million in Mental Health Services Act

(MHSA) funds in FY 2011-12 to fund three
traditional mental health programs previously
funded by the State General Fund:
EPSDT, mental health managed care, and
mental health services for special education
students (formerly the AB 3632 mandate).
The process by which counties receive their
MHSA funding has also changed. Counties
previously received funds 18 to 24 months
after the state received the related tax revenue.
This method allowed counties to plan
ahead for changes in anticipated revenue.
However, funds will now be transferred to
counties monthly based on their allocations
and approved MHSA plans as tax revenue is
received. The process will now be managed
by the State Department of Finance instead
of the State Department of Mental Health.
For FY 2012-13, no Mental Health staff
layoffs are being recommended at this time.
However, the state has not completed its
efforts to resolve its structural budget deficit
and additional changes for mental health are
still possible for the budget year. As more
becomes known, it may become necessary
to make adjustments to the MHSA budget.
The State’s practice of deferring payments
to counties as a means of addressing its
fiscal shortcomings continues to cause cash
flow problems for SYMHS. The Board of
Supervisors has assisted SYMHS in meeting
this difficult challenge by authorizing borrowing
from internal funds of the Human
Services Department. SYMHS pays interest
on these cash flow loans, but the State does
not pay interest on the payments it defers, so
an added cost is imposed on SYMHS as a
result.
This budget is recommended at $230,289
which is an increase of $1,895 (0.8%)
compared to FY 2011-12. The General
Fund provides 60.9% of the funding for this
budget unit. A portion of the costs for this
budget unit are recouped through fees
charged for services provided to
Conservatees and through a contract with
Sutter-Yuba Mental Health Services.
As in FY 2011-12, no reductions are
recommended for this budget unit. Any
reductions to staffing would necessitate a
reduction in service to conservatees and may
cause frequent closing of the office while
staff are attending court hearings and
providing mandated services for
conservatees.
This budget is recommended at $17,186,973
which is a decrease of $349,402 (2.0%)
compared to FY 2011-12. The
Welfare/Social Services fund as a whole
receives $449,000 in financing from the
General Fund in order to meet the County’s
Maintenance of Effort (MOE) for receipt of
CalWORKs and related Realignment
funding.
No further budget reduction is
recommended as the Division has been
forced to increase staffing during FY 2011-
12 to perform accurate and timely eligibility
determinations for citizens who apply for
Medi-Cal and other programs. Counties
may be penalized for failing to process
applications in a timely manner.
Capital Assets recommendations include the
purchase of one sedan to replace an aging
vehicle within the Division’s fleet.
During FY 2011-12, Public Safety
Realignment was implemented, which
realigned the responsibility for many
programs from the State to counties.
Because of this shift in funding, Sutter
County was mandated to establish the
County Local Revenue Fund 2011 (0-140).
For the Welfare and Social Services
Division, the shift in funding simply
changed the flow of funding from the State
to the County without affecting the overall
amount of funding for programs. The
County Local Revenue Fund 2011 is
discussed in greater detail in its own budget
narrative.

This budget is recommended at $2,124,938,
which is an increase of $401,749 (23.3%)
compared to FY 2011-12. This increase is due
to the decision to reflect 100% of the amount
of Welfare/Social Services Realignment
funding used by this budget unit. In years past,
this amount was reflected in the budget’s
unreimbursed cost. The General Fund is not
providing any financing to this budget unit for
FY 2012-13.

This budget is recommended at $9,507,753,
which is a decrease of $1,056,415 (10.0%)
compared to FY 2011-12. The General
Fund does not provide any financing to this
budget unit. The County’s share of cost is
met with Welfare/Social Services
Realignment (1991) funds.
The State’s share of TANF costs, that are
realized as revenue by the County, now
flows through the County Local Revenue
Fund 2011 (0-140) as opposed to being
directly received by the Division through the
Welfare/Social Services Fund as has
occurred in the past. This is simply a
technical budget adjustment and has no net
effect on the budget. The County Local
Revenue Fund 2011 is discussed in greater
detail in its own budget narrative.
This budget is recommended at $3,749,099,
which is a decrease of $542,115 (12.6%)
compared to FY 2011-12. The General
Fund does not provide any financing to this
budget unit. The County’s share of cost is
met with Welfare/Social Services
Realignment (1991) funds.
The State’s share of Foster Care costs, that
are realized as revenue by the County, now
flows through the County Local Revenue
Fund 2011 (0-140) as opposed to being
directly received by the Division through the
Welfare/Social Services Fund as has
occurred in the past. This is simply a
technical budget adjustment and has no net
effect on the budget. The County Local
Revenue Fund 2011 is discussed in greater
detail in its own budget narrative.

This budget is recommended at $4,154,209,
which is an increase of $304,509 (7.9%)
compared to FY 2011-12. The General
Fund does not provide any financing to this
budget unit. The County’s share of cost is
met with Welfare/Social Services
Realignment (1991) funds.
The State’s share of Adoption costs, that are
realized as revenue by the County, now
flows through the County Local Revenue
Fund 2011 (0-140) as opposed to being
directly received by the Division through the
Welfare/Social Services Fund as has
occurred in the past. This is simply a
technical budget adjustment and has no net
effect on the budget. The County Local
Revenue Fund 2011 is discussed in greater
detail in its own budget narrative.

Recommended Budget
This budget is recommended at $75,200,
which is a decrease of $8,350 (10.0%)
compared to FY 2011-12.
During FY 2011-12, this budget unit was
moved from the Welfare/Social Services
Fund to the General Fund to reflect that
100% of the financing for this budget unit is
provided by the General Fund.

This budget is recommended at $3,117,320 a
4.5 % reduction compared to FY 2011-12.
This budget unit does not receive any funding
from the General Fund. All funding is
provided through State and Federal sources.
The recommended budget reflects a proposed
change in two positions:
 Eliminating the Legal Secretary due
to a retirement; and
 Funding a Child Support Specialist
I/II position.
In FY 2010-11, the Chief Child Support
Attorney position was unfunded and it is
recommended that this continue for FY 2012-
13.
Additional reductions in this budget unit could
jeopardize the amount of State and Federal
funding that this budget unit would receive in
the future. The budget unit must spend all of
the funding that is received from these sources
in order to maintain this level of funding.

This budget is recommended at $3,418,363,
which is a decrease of $130,663 (3.7%)
compared to FY 2011-12. The General
Fund provides approximately 57% of the
financing for this budget unit and is reduced
by $41,924 (1.4%) for FY 2012-13.
It should be noted that these funding
calculations reflect the addition of Public
Safety Augmentation Funds (Proposition 172),
which are transferred into the Public Safety
fund through the Public Safety General budget
unit (2-210). California voters enacted
Proposition 172 in 1993, which established a
permanent statewide half-cent sales tax for
support of local public safety functions.
During FY 2011-12, the District Attorney
eliminated one filled Legal Secretary II
position and left vacant one full-time Deputy
District Attorney position, two full-time
Senior Criminal Investigator positions and
one half-time Victim Advocate position to
further reduce costs. These positions remain
vacant and unfunded. For FY 2012-13, the
District Attorney has agreed to leave vacant
and unfunded one additional Senior
Criminal Investigator position. One of the
vacant and unfunded Senior Criminal
Investigator positions, currently assigned to
the Anti-Drug Abuse (2-302) budget unit, is
recommended to be eliminated as it is a
Limited-Term position.
Due to the State’s ongoing fiscal crisis, all
State grants and State-funded programs,
such as Child Abduction, are potentially at
risk of being reduced or eliminated. Any

significant budget cuts at the State level
could have a further impact on the District
Attorney’s Office budget.
There is currently $28,048 budgeted for
State Citizens’ Option for Public Safety
(COPS) revenue and $133,101 budgeted for
California Emergency Management Agency
(CalEMA) grant revenue in the District
Attorney’s budget.
Further reductions are not recommended at
this time as they would result in the
elimination of additional personnel and
would directly affect the current level of
service provided to the County.

This budget is recommended at $379,750,
which is a decrease of $134,695 (26.2%)
compared to FY 2011-12. This decrease is
primarily related to the completion of the
ARRA stimulus grant program funding in FY
2011-12. Along with the completion of the
ARRA funding, two vacant Limited-Term
positions are recommended to be eliminated
from the Anti-Drug Abuse budget unit; one
Limited-Term Senior Criminal Investigator
position and one Limited-Term Deputy
Probation Officer III position.
Any further reductions to this budget unit
would directly affect the level of services
provided. Due to the lack of any budgeted
services and supplies in this budget unit, all
reductions would necessarily involve
personnel. These reductions would
subsequently be further reflected in the District
Attorney, Probation and Sheriff’s budget units.

This budget is recommended at $42,914,
which is an increase of $2,953 (7.4%)
compared to FY 2011-12. The General Fund
provides 100% of the financing for this
budget unit.
The increase in costs for FY 2012-13 are
primarily due to a change in meeting
location for the Grand Jury. This change
was out of the control of both the County
and the Grand Jury and was necessitated by
a reorganization of the Superior Court’s
offices.
It should be noted that many of the
expenditures incurred by each year’s Grand
Jury are authorized in Government Code and
are not restricted by the County’s annual
budget. These expenditure items are based
on the needs of each year’s Grand Jury and
may vary from year to year. The County
ultimately has limited ability to affect or
predict expenditures.
This budget is recommended at $1,440,300,
which is a decrease of $159,700 (10.0%)
compared to FY 2011-12. The CAO supports
paying the budgeted amount, in lieu of the
actual pro rata share of each county, to enable
the continued operation of this vital facility.

This budget is recommended at $1,000, which
is the same as in FY 2011-12. This budget unit
does not receive financing from the General
Fund as it is funded by Realignment funds,
which are transferred from the Local Health
and Welfare Trust, Social Services Fund (0-
248).

This budget is recommended at $5,445,228,
which is an increase of $542,958 (11.1%)
compared to FY 2011-12. However, the
Department’s unreimbursed cost has been
decreased by $233,723 (7.7%). These
changes, which have resulted in a savings to
the General Fund, are primarily related to
Public Safety Realignment as described above.

No further reductions are recommended for
this budget. Public Safety Realignment has
greatly shifted the responsibility of offender
supervision from the state to counties. For the
present, funding through Realignment has
been made available to enable the takeover of
this monumental task. However, continued
funding is in question due to the lack of a
Constitutional Amendment guaranteeing the
Public Safety Realignment funding in future
years. This issue will continue to be closely
monitored by the County so adjustments to
budgets can be made as necessitated by future
funding availability.
This budget unit receives $71,000 in
Realignment (1991) funds, which are
transferred from the Local Health and Welfare
Trust, Social Services Fund (0-248).

This budget is recommended at $645,611
which is a decrease of $2,965 (0.5%)
compared to FY 2011-12. However, due to
additional financing provided through Public
Safety Realignment, the unreimbursed cost
of the budget has decreased $24,068 (3.8%).
The General Fund provides 96.2% of the
financing for this budget unit.
In order to maintain the quality of services
provided to indigent defendants and assure
that court proceedings are not interrupted or
delayed because the Public Defender’s
Office is unable to accept an appointment, it
is requested that the Services and Supplies
portion of the budget be reduced. This
reduction would be accomplished through a
reduction in Professional & Specialized
Services by reducing investigative services
costs and the contract costs of certain
Deputy Public Defenders. The budget for
investigative services is being reduced by
$5,000.
In comparing court appointed misdemeanor
cases in the first eight months of FY 2010-
11 with the first eight months of FY 2011-
12, there was a 10% decrease in appointed
cases. As a result, the Deputy Misdemeanor
Public Defenders contracts will be reduced
for a total annual savings of $4,800. This is
the second reduction in two years.
In comparing appointed felony cases for the
first eight months of FY 2010-11 with the
first eight months of FY 2011-12, there was
a 9% decrease in appointed felony cases and
a 55% decrease in violation of probation
cases. The reduction in violation of
probation cases is believed to be directly
related to the implementation of AB 109
Public Safety Realignment as of October 1,
2011. As a result, each of the Deputy
Felony Public Defender contracts will be
reduced for a total annual savings of $7,200.
It is expected that appointed violation of
probation cases will continue to drop until
July 2013, when the Public Defender’s

and Post Release Community Supervision
revocation proceedings. As a result, in FY
2013-14, it is anticipated that additional
funding will be required to cover the costs of
violation of probation cases not previously
handled by the Public Defender prior to
Public Safety Realignment.
For FY 2012-13, the cost of conservatorship
cases is being included in the Professional &
Specialized Services account after
inadvertently being excluded in FY 2011-12.
Though the Superior Court is ordering in
some cases, as a condition of probation,
payment of a nominal fee for reimbursement
to the County of Sutter for the services of
the Public Defender’s Office, it is difficult to
predict how much revenue will be received
for FY 2012-13. The Sutter County Public
Defender’s Office has been able to collect
for services rendered to those who have
been involuntarily held at private psychiatric
centers. Based upon the first seven months
of the FY 2011-12, it is anticipated the
Department should receive reimbursement
revenues totaling $4,850 for FY 2012-13.
Further reductions for the Public Defender’s
Office are not recommended. Additional
reductions would directly impact the number
of Deputy Public Defenders available to
provide assistance to court appointed
individuals. A greater budget reduction
would result in elimination of a Deputy
Public Defender position that would directly
impact either the felony or misdemeanor
appointments. This would lead to services
becoming unavailable to court appointed
defendants and a strong possibility of having
experienced attorneys unwilling to work for
less than what was previously offered
considering the increased number of
appointments that they would each receive.
Another possible consequence of further
reductions, after already incurring a 9.6%
reduction for FY 2011-12, would be the
unavailability of Deputy Public Defenders
from the Public Defender’s Office taking on
the additional case load. This would likely
result in the utilization of court-appointed
attorneys who would charge the County an
hourly rate for representation rather than that
of a Deputy Public Defender under contract.
Costs to the County would greatly increase.

This budget is recommended at $296,000,
which is an increase of $9,700 (3.4%)
compared to FY 2011-12. The General
Fund does not provide any financing for this
budget unit. The increase in this budget is
due to an increase in the Appropriation for
Contingency. This contingency is
recommended for mitigation of possible
increased costs due to Public Safety
Realignment.
This fund is financed by revenue generated
from inmate use of public telephones and
inmate purchases from the jail commissary.

This budget is recommended at $2,965,947,
which is an increase of $159,605 (5.7%).
The General Fund provides approximately
57% of the financing for the Sheriff’s
Department and is increased in the
Communications budget by 2.8%.
The recommended increase in the
Communications budget is primarily due to
the recommended Capital Assets purchase
for the 911 telephone system. This is
recommended at $200,000 and is partially
funded by the State. The State will not pay
for the maintenance of a 911 telephone
system beyond five years of the purchase
date. The current system is aging and parts
may not be available if the system requires
repair at any point in the near future.
The recommended budget includes the
continued use of Sheriff’s Assessment Fee
Funds (0-225) to fund a Sheriff’s Legal
Specialist position. These funds were first
used for this purpose in FY 2011-12. This
maintains the General Fund contribution for
this position at $0 for another year.
For the second consecutive year, it is
recommended to leave three positions
vacant and unfunded in the Communications
budget. These positions are a Criminal
Records Technician, a Public Safety
Dispatcher and a Supervising Public Safety
Dispatcher. Defunding and leaving these
positions vacant negatively impacts the level
of service internally and to the public.
Further reductions are not recommended at
this time.

This budget is recommended at $549,760,
which is an increase of $17,830 (3.4%)
compared to FY 2011-12. The General Fund
does not provide any financing for this budget
unit as it is 100% funded by the State.
Trial court security was a component of Public
Safety Realignment in FY 2011-12. Therefore,
funding is first deposited into the County Local
Revenue Fund 2011 (0-140) before it is
transferred into this operating budget. The County Local Revenue Fund 2011 is discussed
in greater detail in its own budget narrative.

This budget is recommended at $5,784,082,
which is a decrease of $346,298 (5.6%).
The General Fund provides approximately
57% of the financing for the Sheriff’s
Department and is reduced in the Sheriff-
Coroner budget by $277,294 (5.2%)
compared to FY 2011-12.
It should be noted that these funding
calculations reflect the addition of Public
Safety Augmentation Funds (Proposition
172), which are transferred into the Public
Safety fund through the Public Safety
General budget unit (2-210). California
voters enacted Proposition 172 in 1993,
which established a permanent statewide
half-cent sales tax for support of local public
safety functions.
For FY 2012-13, it is recommended that an
additional three currently vacant Deputy
Sheriff positions be left vacant and unfunded
for a total of six vacant and unfunded
Deputy Sheriff positions and one vacant and
unfunded Patrol Lieutenant position. Even
with these vacancies, the Sheriff’s number
of filled Deputy Sheriff positions will be
higher than the average over the past several
years. Since FY 2008-09, the average
number of filled Deputy Sheriff positions in
the Sheriff-Coroner budget unit has been 29.
The current recommendation provides for 30
filled Deputy Sheriff positions.
No further reductions are recommended at
this time. Any further reductions would mean
a reduction is staffing. As indicated above,
the recommended budget maintain reductions
implemented in FY 2011-12, which included
leaving three Correctional Officer positions
vacant and unfunded and eliminating one
Food Service Worker in the Jail budget (2-
301), and leaving one Supervising Public

Safety Dispatcher position and one Public
Safety Dispatcher position vacant and
unfunded in the Communications budget (1-
600). Additionally, in order to achieve a
budget reduction, no high mileage patrol cars
were replaced in FY 2011-12. Also, one
Sheriff’s Legal Specialist position was agreed
to be funded for one year through the
expenditure of funds from the Sheriff’s
Assessment Fees special revenue fund (0-
225).
In FY 2010-11, three Deputy Sheriff
positions were left vacant and unfunded.
These positions remained vacant and
unfunded throughout FY 2011-12 along
with the addition of a Patrol Lieutenant
position. Three additional Deputy Sheriff
positions were recommended to be unfunded
in FY 2011-12, but these positions were
ultimately funded.
Capital Assets are recommended at
$127,000 for the purchase of three vehicles:
one patrol vehicle and two K9 patrol
vehicles. Funds from the Sheriff’s Asset
Seizure fund (0-286) and COPS funds are
recommended to be used to fund these
purchases. The remainder of COPS funds,
including funds to be received during FY
2012-13, will be recommended to fund
replacement security equipment, such as
firearms and tasers, for the Sheriff’s Office.

This budget is recommended at $301,840,
which is a decrease of $5,821 (1.9%)
compared to FY 2011-12. The General Fund
provides approximately 57% of the financing

for the Sheriff’s Department, which includes
the Boat Patrol budget unit.
It should be noted that these funding
calculations reflect the addition of Public
Safety Augmentation Funds (Proposition
172), which are transferred into the Public
Safety fund through the Public Safety
General budget unit (2-210). California
voters enacted Proposition 172 in 1993,
which established a permanent statewide
half-cent sales tax for support of local public
safety functions.
Total expenditures for the Boat Patrol budget
unit are largely reimbursed by the State
Department of Boating and Waterways.
These reimbursements are derived from boat
registration fees. The County contributes
collected boat taxes, and pays for
expenditures not subject to State
reimbursement. As indicated above, this
budget unit also receives, in concept, a share
of Proposition 172 funding.
The Department of Boating and Waterways’
allocation to Sutter County is likely to remain
at $214,800 as it has for the past several
years. Thus, any expenditure increases
beyond the allocation and collected boat
taxes would become a County General Fund
cost.
No reductions are recommended for this
budget unit. The Sheriff staffs this budget
unit with personnel from the Sheriff-Coroner
budget unit (2-201). Any reductions to the
Sheriff-Coroner budget unit may
correspondingly reduce Boat Patrol staffing.

This budget is recommended at $1,213,346,
which is an increase of $60,480 (5.2%)
compared to FY 2011-12. The General Fund
cost is decreased by $15,156 (6.7%).
The majority of costs for patrolling the area
in and around the City of Live Oak are
shared 80% by the City and 20% by the
County. The salary and benefits of a

items, and new patrol vehicles are costs
covered in full by the City. The Sheriff
provides some law-enforcement services to
the City of Live Oak at no charge for which
the City would have to pay if it were to have
its own police department, or if it had a
typical contract for sheriff services. Among
these services are dispatch, detectives (for
major felonies), records, narcotics, and
special enforcement detail (SWAT).
No reductions are recommended for this
budget unit. The Sheriff staffs this budget
unit with personnel from the Sheriff-
Coroner budget unit (2-201). Any
reductions to the Sheriff-Coroner budget
unit may correspondingly reduce Live Oak
Contract staffing. Any changes to staffing
levels would necessitate an adjustment to the
contract between Sutter County and the City
of Live Oak.

This budget is recommended at $8,391,918,
which is an increase of $920,637 (12.3%)
compared to FY 2011-12. The General
Fund provides approximately 57% of the
financing for the Sheriff’s Department as a
whole. The Jail’s budgeted unreimbursed
cost has increased $596,275 (8.3%) versus
FY 2011-12. The increase in unreimbursed
cost is primarily due to the increase in Jail
Medical costs.
Jail Medical expenses are budgeted to
increase by $464,054 over FY 2011-12. The
total Jail Medical budget is now over $2
million, an increase of nearly 29% in one
year. This increase in cost is due to both a
recommended increase in nursing staff and
due to a continued escalation in utilization
of hospital services by inmates. The Jail
Medical budget (4-134) is discussed in
greater detail in its own budget narrative.
Though overall budget reductions are a
necessity of the FY 2012-13 Recommended
Budget, no reductions are recommended for
the Jail budget unit. The effects of Public
Safety Realignment are likely to be more
fully realized during FY 2012-13 with an
anticipated increase in Jail population and
related increases in costs in staffing, inmate
medical costs, and other related expenses.

This budget is recommended at $961,887,
which is the same as FY 2011-12. The
General Fund provides 16.4% of the
financing for this budget unit. One-time
revenue of $495 is being budgeted for
repayment of the Trial Court Fund’s share of
a worker’s compensation reserve from the
Worker’s Compensation Dividend Fund (0-
165). The fund has had no activity since
1998 and is recommended to be closed.

This budget is recommended at
$19,835,665. All funding is provided by the
State through Public Safety Realignment.
As previously stated, this fund is designed to
be a “pass-through” budget where funds will
immediately pass through to the appropriate
operating budget or special revenue fund as
budgeted. Funding budgeted to be used
completely each fiscal year will pass through
to an operating budget, while funds not used
completely in a single fiscal year will pass
through to a special revenue fund, so any
unused funds will remain separate across
budget years. This prevents fund balances
from becoming co-mingled and will allow
each department responsible for these
realigned funds to accurately and more easily
track the expenditure and fund balance of
individual revenue streams.

This budget is recommended at $76,050. This
budget unit does not receive financing from
the General Fund. The District receives its
funding from ad valorem property taxes on
properties within the district.
Expenses are for utilities, repairs, and staff
administration. At this time, staff expenses
include efforts to incorporate lighting data

into the County’s Geographic Information
System (GIS).
This budget is recommended at $2,950,369
and includes Intrafund Administration
Service charges from the Public Works
budget unit (1-920). The General Fund
provides 85% of the financing for this
budget unit and is reduced by $427,187
(14.7%) compared to FY 2011-12. A
portion of the costs for this budget unit are
recouped from outside and subvented funds
through the annual A-87 cost plan.
Building Maintenance
In FY 2011-12, one full-time building
services worker position and one office
assistant position were eliminated. The FY
2012-13 recommended budget includes
additional Services & Supplies reductions.
Building Maintenance will be required to
operate below the funding level necessary to
professionally maintain the facilities of the
County. Any major maintenance needs
(major system failures, HVAC unit
replacement, major roof repairs or
replacement), or the addition of maintained
space could require additional funding. Any
utility cost increases or unseasonable
weather related spikes in utility costs are not
anticipated in the budget.
The recommended budget includes a
reduction in General Supplies which will
require adjustments in established schedules
for preventative maintenance. This could
result in greater equipment failures or major
facilities problems.
Professional and Specialized Services are
recommended to include only known
recurring contract work such as elevator
maintenance, fire extinguisher maintenance,
pest control services and card access system
repairs and monitoring. No surplus funds are
budgeted for unanticipated work.
Additional funding would be requested if
additional services are required.
Maintenance of Structure & Improvements
is recommended at $30,000 to cover only
those maintenance projects under $15,000 in
cost.
Building Maintenance will be negatively
affected by the partial reassignment of a
Building Services Worker to the Grounds

Maintenance program. This position is
being reassigned in order to offset the loss of
Extra Help funding in the Grounds
Maintenance program.
Possible Service Impacts:
a. No painting of office spaces and
facilities for aesthetic purposes;
b. General moving requests submitted
by County departments will be
deferred pending availability of staff
(unscheduled maintenance work
orders and preventative maintenance
will have priority);
c. Rescheduling monthly preventative
maintenance inspections to bimonthly
(i.e.; building security
inspections, parking lot/exterior
lighting inspections, exterior flag
inspections);
d. Rescheduling of HVAC preventative
maintenance to every four months
instead of quarterly;
e. Increase in staff response time for
unscheduled maintenance requests
that do not create a potential safety
issue or affect the essential
operations of the requesting
department. A deferred maintenance
list will be maintained by the
Division.
Grounds Maintenance
In FY 2011-12, the permanent grounds
maintenance staff was reduced from four to
three positions. The FY 2012-13
recommended budget includes the
elimination of Extra Help.
The remaining Groundskeeper II staff will
be required to perform maintenance
normally performed by Extra Help, creating
a backlog of higher level work such as
irrigation repairs, weed control, chemical
application (spraying), fertilization, and tree
maintenance/ replacement.
Possible Service Impacts:
a. Reduced maintenance such as
irrigation repairs, tree and shrub
replacement, weed control and
fertilization may affect the
appearance of the grounds;
b. Changes in frequency of mowing
from every two weeks to every three
weeks during the spring and summer
may result in increased grass and
weed height as well as visible
irregularities;
c. Additional reduction in leaf cleanup
in parking lots and on walkways
during the fall months;
d. Additional changes in the frequency
of watering may result in browning
of the lawn and turf areas;
e. Decrease in frequency of chemical
application for weed control and
fertilizing of the lawn and turf areas;
f. Decrease in frequency of trimming
and pruning of trees, shrubs and
bushes;
g. Increase in response time for repairs
to irrigation systems.
Custodial Services
In FY 2011-12, three of 17 custodial
positions were eliminated. The FY 2012-13
recommended budget includes a reduction in
cleaning supplies. This could lead to a
reduction in special cleaning projects such
as the removal of stains on flooring and
countertops.
In FY 2011-12, weekly door mat services at
the Agricultural Commissioner’s office and

the Sheriffs Training Center were cancelled.
Mats were purchased and will be cleaned by
staff on an as needed basis.
The recommended budget includes changes
related to contracted custodial services for
Mental Health. The services listed below
will be billed directly to, and paid by, the
Mental Health budget unit.
 Children’s System of Care 809 Plumas
Street
 Mental Health
1547 Starr Dr. Bldg 2, Suite H
 Mental Health
545 B Garden Hwy
 First Step
1251 Onstott Road
This will slightly increase the administrative
burden on Mental Health staff.
Additional reductions to the Building
Maintenance budget, beyond the proposed
level, would require additional staff
reductions and would lead to the inability to
systematically perform maintenance tasks
necessary for continued County operations.
Therefore, no further reductions are
recommended at this time.
This budget is recommended at $1,330,890.
The recommendation includes nine projects
that were authorized in prior years and are
continuing in FY 2012-13, as well as one
new project for FY 2012-13.
It is recommended that immediate
authorization be given to the Public Works
Director to continue work on prior year
projects which are being re-budgeted and to
start work on the one new project, without
waiting for the adoption of the final budget
resolution.
This budget is recommended at $1,100,654
after offsetting Intrafund Administration
Service reimbursements are considered. The
budget is $1,491,142 prior to application of
intra-departmental reimbursements of
$390,488 to the Public Works budget unit
from other Public Works budget units. The
General Fund provides 39% of the financing
38.4% for this budget unit when Interfund
revenues are considered and is increased by
$292,352 (224%) compared to FY 2011-12.
The recommended budget includes holding a
vacant Accounting Technician I position
unfunded for 6 months, with a savings of
$32,662, and an increase of $20,933 in Extra
Help to cover the position for that time frame.
In the FY 2011-12 budget, a Limited Term
Accountant II position was added to cover a
long-term absence. This position is no longer
necessary and has been removed from the FY
2012-13 budget.
In FY 2010-11, an Engineering Technician II
position was defunded and remained vacant
and defunded in FY 2011-12. It is
recommended that this position remain
defunded and vacant through FY 2012-13.
The recommended budget reflects an overall
net reduction of $312,470 in Interfund and
Intrafund Administrative Service revenues,
which is seen as savings to other Public
Works budget units.
Considering the continued vacancies in the
Division, and in an effort to meet the
department-wide budget reduction, it will be
necessary for the department to reorganize
staff assignments by using personnel on both
General Fund and non-General Fund projects.
Additional reductions in the Public Works
budget unit, beyond those recommended
would require additional staff reductions
which would reduce the Department’s ability
to provide the required services. Therefore,
no additional reductions are recommended at
this time.

This budget is recommended at $182,182.
It was recommended in FY 2011-12 that this
fund be closed and that the residual balance
of the original contribution from the General
fund be transferred back to the General Fund
and deposited to the General Fund’s
Designation. The Board of Supervisors
approved the CAO’s original recommended
action in the Final Budget. The Auditor-
Controller disagrees with that action and has
asked for revised action from the Board of
Supervisors in order to perform the
originally approved action and to close the
fund.
Therefore, it is recommended that the
approved action for FY 2011-12 be
rescinded in FY 2011-12 and that the
recommendation to transfer the remaining
balance to the General Fund be re-budgeted
in FY 2012-13 and the Auditor-Controller to
be directed to deposit any additional interest
that accrues to the fund to the General Fund
and to close the Capital Projects Fund once
all necessary transfers have been completed.
The recommended transfer in FY 2012-13
equals $182,182, reflecting the Committed
Fund Balance at June 30, 2011 of $178,478,
plus estimated interest to be accrued through
June 30, 2012 in the amount of $3,704. Any
interested accrued to the fund between July
1, 2012 and the time that the Auditor-
Controller closes the fund shall also be
transferred to the General Fund.

This budget is recommended at $1,602,811
and includes Intrafund Administration
Services charges from the Public Works
budget unit (1-920).
The Fleet Management budget unit operates
as an ISF and must balance revenue to
expenditure within the fund.
Compared to FY 2011-12, the recommended
budget reflects a $46,656 (2.9%) net
decrease in the three Interfund revenue
accounts used to charge County customers
for services provided: Interfund Fuel & Oil,
Interfund Vehicle Maintenance, and
Interfund Fleet Administration.
Reductions in Fleet Administration support
are being made with the goal of minimizing
cost impact to the County customer.
Reductions may impact the services
provided by Fleet administrative staff. The
first priority will be claims processing and
billing of services with the development of
Fleet statistical information being completed
as time permits.
Proposed reductions in services and supplies
will impact operations by deferring minor
dent and body repairs that have no impact on
the safety of the operator and passengers. If
the number of vehicles requiring parts or
repairs during FY 2012-13 exceeds the
available funding, additional funding
requests will be brought to the Board.
Due to the volatility in the price of fuel, it is
difficult to accurately estimate the future
cost of fuel. Based on higher fuel prices,
offset by reduced fuel use across
departments, the recommended budget for
FY 2012-13 includes $506,739 for the
purchase of fuel for the majority of County
departments. This represents an 8% decrease
in this budget item compared to FY 2011-
12. Additional funding may be required if
major prolonged upward fluctuations in fuel
prices are experienced.

Additional reductions to the Fleet
Management ISF would require a significant
reduction in the number of County vehicles
maintained. Therefore, no further
reductions are recommended at this time.

This budget is recommended at $285,888
and includes Intrafund Administration
Service charges from the Public Works
budget unit (1-920). The General Fund
provides 100% of the financing for this
budget unit and is reduced $10,788 (3.6%)
compared to FY 2011-12. A portion of the
costs for this budget are recouped from
outside and subvented funds through the
annual A-87 cost plan.
Intrafund Administration services are
recommended at $46,953 which is a
reduction of $17,177 (26.8%) compared to
FY 2011-12. The administrative costs
include Public Works accounting and
management staff’s time spent in support of
the Purchasing Division.
The FY 2011-12 recommended budget
included the elimination of one filled
Central Services Assistant III position and
the addition of one half-time Central
Services Assistant I position resulting in the
reduction of staff from 3 FTE to 2.5 FTE.
This recommendation was rescinded after
the recommended budget was finalized and
subsequently the Central Services Assistant
III position was reinstated and the half-time
position was eliminated for the final FY
2011-12 amended budget.
Further reductions to the Purchasing budget,
beyond the recommended level, would result
in additional staff reductions which would
necessitate the decentralization of the
remaining services provided by the
Purchasing Office and potentially the

elimination of centralized purchasing
functions for the County. Therefore, no
further reductions are recommended at this
time.
This budget is recommended at $326,938 and
includes Intrafund Administration Service
charges from the Public Works budget unit (1-
920). The General Fund provides
approximately 4.6% of the financing for this
budget and is increased $753 (6%) compared
to FY 2011-12. The remainder of the cost is
directly charged to those budget units utilizing
the services.

This budget is recommended at $21,701.
This budget unit does not receive any
funding from the General Fund. All funding
is provided through fines and interest.
Special Department Expense, account
#52207, is used to support expenses related
to programs, events and donations such as:
 Pheasants for the annual pheasant
hunt;
 Support of duck egg projects;
 Yuba Sutter Fair booth and related
expenses;
 Donations of equipment to the Game
Wardens; and
 Donations to support special events,
programs and projects.
Youth Programs, account #52240, is used to
support expenses specifically tied to youth
educational programs, events and donations
such as:
 Youth fishing derbies;
 Salmon aquarium programs;
 School educational programs and
field trips; and
 Shady Creek Outdoor School
scholarships.

This budget is recommended at $1,091,995
and includes Interfund Public Works
Administrative Service charges from the
Public Works budget unit (1-920). The
General Fund does not generally provide
any funding for this budget unit, however, a
General Fund loan, not to exceed $185,000,
was granted in FY 2010-11 to fund on-going
operations. Only a portion of that loan was
utilized in FY 2010-11. Due to lower than
budgeted expenditures, the Airport did not
draw on the loan in FY 2011-12. In FY
2012-13, $88,492 of the loan balance will be
used to fund operations, leaving a balance of
$36,384 of available loan proceeds from the
original $185,000 loan.
Annual revenue for this budget unit does not
cover basic operational expenditures,
therefore no repayment schedule for the loan
has been proposed. The Ad Hoc Committee
continues to work with the County
Administrator’s Office to evaluate options to
address this deficit and to develop a formal
plan for repayment of the loan to the
General Fund.
The FY 2012-13 Recommended Budget
includes $720,947 in charges for the
construction of the runway/taxiway lighting
upgrade, obstruction removal and parking
apron design. Approximately $693,808
(97%) of these costs will be covered by
grants from the FAA and the State. The
runway and taxiway lighting upgrade will
update the runway lighting and signage to
meet current FAA standards for aircraft
operations. Additionally, the project will
include the replacement of the Precision
Approach Path Indicator (PAPI) for the
runway 17 approach, a new concrete
electrical vault, a new lighted wind cone and
minor asphalt paving at the runway and
taxiway transitions.
The FAA grants used to support past Airport
improvements have paid for approximately
95% of the improvement costs. Legislation
has been passed that will reduce future FAA
grant funding to 90%, which will seriously
impact the funding of Airport Capital
Improvement Projects.
Interfund Public Works Administration
Services are recommended at $52,171 which
is an increase of $16,275 (46%) compared to
FY 2011-12. The administrative costs
include Public Works accounting and
management staff’s time spent in support of
the Airport. This increase reflects the
additional time spent working with the Ad
Hoc Committee and the County
Administrator’s office to find solutions to
the financing issues facing this budget unit.
The FY 2012-13 Recommended Budget
includes $95,484 in Interfund Overhead A-
87 Cost Plan charges. The Cost Plan is
developed each year by the Auditor-
Controller’s office and reflects county-wide
overhead charges based on actual costs from
FY 2010-11.
Additional reductions to the Sutter County
Airport Budget, beyond the recommended
level, would result in the loss of services,
which could in turn impair the County’s
ability to procure Federal or State Funding
for improvements.
This budget is recommended at $230,917
and includes Intrafund Administration
Services charges from the Public Works
budget unit (1-920). The General Fund
provides 90% of the financing for this
budget unit and is reduced $28,825 (12.2%)
compared to FY 2011-12.
The impact of this reduction will be a
reduction in grounds keeping and
maintenance of the Parks. Members of the
public can expect to see the following
changes:
• A reduction in the frequency of
mowing (and related lawn/turf
maintenance), from weekly to biweekly
during the spring and
summer;
• A reduction in the frequency of leaf
cleanup during the fall and winter;
and
• A reduction in the frequency of
watering times for lawn/turf areas,
shrubs, and plants resulting in visible
browning.
Intrafund Administration Services are
recommended at $16,955 which is a
reduction of $13,919 (45%) compared to FY
2011-12. The administrative costs include
Public Works accounting and management
staff’s time spent in support of the Parks and
Recreation budget unit.
This budget is recommended at $194,212
and includes Intrafund Administration
Services charges from the Public Works
budget unit (1-920). The General fund
provides 83% of the financing for this
budget unit and is increased $54,760 (53%)
compared to FY 2011-12
The FY 2012-13 Recommended Budget
includes $140, 608 in Intrafund A-87 Cost
Plan Building Maintenance charges which is
an increase of $78,455 (127%) compared to
FY 2011-12. The Cost Plan is developed
each year by the Auditor-Controller’s office
and reflects Building Maintenance charges
based on actual costs from FY 2010-11.
The recommended budget reflects a
reduction in Maintenance & Rentals fees
based on historical records showing
decreased rentals.
Additional reductions to the Veteran’s
Memorial Community Building budget
beyond the recommended level could result
in closure of the facility. Therefore, no
further reductions are recommended at this
time.

This budget is recommended at $32,771 and
does not include Intrafund Administration
Services charges from the Public Works
budget unit (1-920). The General Fund
provides 9% of the estimated financing for
this budget unit. The budgeted amounts
represent estimates because the Hall has not
yet been rented and there are no actual
figures on which to base the budget.
The FY 2012-13 Recommended Budget
includes estimated rental revenues of
$30,000. The Community Memorial
Museum budget unit (7-201) is estimated to
receive $14,000, through the Intrafund
Museum Rental Revenue account, which
represents one-half of the net rental revenue
(less rental expenses). The remaining half
of the net rental revenue is returned to the
General Fund to cover the General Fund
loan made to construct the facility.

This budget is recommended at $14,130,169
and includes Interfund Public Works
Administration charges from the Public
Works budget unit (1-920). This budget does
not receive any funding from the General
Fund. All funding is provided through fees,
taxes, and State and Federal funding.
In FY 2010-11, the Road Maintenance
Division defunded seven vacant positions.
These positions are recommended to remain
vacant and unfunded in FY 2012-13. Due to
increasing costs, with minor increases in State
program revenues, the Road Division
reviewed its operations and has adjusted its
core functions and staffing to match the
funding that is consistently available.
Capital Assets are requested at $335,000 for:
• One Motorized Road Grader to
support the increased unpaved road
maintenance program ($245,000);
• One slide-in Truck Body Heated
Asphalt Patch Box ($60,000); and
One replacement light utility vehicle
($30,000).
Because the construction season spans two
fiscal years, the recommended budget
includes funding and appropriations for the
carryover of selected construction projects
originally budgeted in the previous fiscal year
and may contain portions of the previous
fiscal year Road Plan.
The FY 2012-13 recommended budget
includes the following major projects:
• Construction effort for Pleasant Grove
Creek Bridge ($1,122,449);
• Design of the Pennington Road Bridge
($81,000);
• Design initiation for Nicholas Avenue
(Coon Creek) and Larkin Avenue
(Butte Canal) Bridges ($286,296); and
• Continuation of the Bridge
Preventative Maintenance Program
($106,000) and the Bridge Scour
Program ($56,000), which are funded
in part by the State.
Finally, after two years of delays in obtaining
a permit, the Road Department will move
forward with improvements to Butte House
Road; a 90% Highway Safety Improvement
Program (HSIP) funded project ($886,650).
An aggressive road seal and overlay program
is slated for the coming year and will include
the paving of major roadways and residential
areas ($2,932,352) as described in the adopted
FY 2012-13 Road Plan (attached).
Interfund Public Works Administration
Services are recommended at $441,498, which
is an increase of $70,086 (19%) compared to
FY 2011-12. The administrative charges
include Public Works’ accounting and
management staff’s time spent in support of
the Road Division.
Interfund Miscellaneous Non-Road revenues
are recommended at $100,750, an increase of
$57,750. The FY 2011-12 adopted budget
reflected these charges in the Interfund
Admin-Miscellaneous Departments account as
well as the Interfund Miscellaneous Non-
Road account. The revenue reflects charges
to other budget units for administrative,
engineering, weed control, and maintenance
work performed by staff in the Road Division.
State Highway Users Tax Apportionment
(HUTA - gas excise tax) revenues are based
on current market conditions. HUTA tax is
partially protected from redirection or
borrowing by the legislature under
Proposition 40 (The California Clean Water,
Clean Air, Safe Neighborhood Parks, and
Coastal Protection Act of 2002). The
revenues from HUTA sections 2104, 2105 and
2106 fund most of the in-house road program,
and HUTA section 2103 is used to provide a
portion of the major maintenance and
rehabilitation programs in the Road Plan.
Annually, the County receives a portion of the
Local Transportation Fund (LTF) under the
Transportation Development Act (TDA).
These funds are available for road work after
public transportation needs have been met.
Under an agreement with the Yuba–Sutter
Transportation Agency, an allocation of funds
is made to the County, which is used for
general road maintenance and repairs. The
annual amount available depends on State
revenues and is estimated at $805,860 for FY
2012-13.
The Department utilizes special program
revenues, or one-time revenues, which are

seen as less consistent, by using construction
contracts for those specific projects. The
functions of the in-house Road Maintenance
staff are continuing to evolve and will begin
to focus more on recurring maintenance tasks
and service response requests.
In FY 2011-12, the State distributed the
remaining entitlements for Proposition 1B
funds to the County in the amount of
$2,304,936, of which $809,499 remains to be
expended in FY 2012-13. Proposition 1B, the
Highway Safety, Traffic Reduction, Air
Quality, and Port Security Bond Act of 2006,
authorized the State to sell $19.9 billion in
general obligation bonds to fund state and
local transportation improvement projects to:
• Relieve congestion;
• Improve movement of goods;
• Improve air quality; and
• Enhance safety and security of the
transportation system.
Public Works staff obtained funding from
SACOG in the amount of $2,195,837 for the
rehabilitation of paved roads eligible for
Federal funding. The recommended budget
includes the Regional Surface Transportation
Program (RSTP) revenue for FY 2012-13.
RSTP is a federally funded program, used
primarily for road construction, to include
new, rehabilitation or replacement
construction. The program is funded under the
current Transportation Equity Act, which is
five year Federal legislation for all
transportation related funding. This Act
expired in Federal Fiscal Year (FFY) 2009,
but has been extended thru FFY 2012.
The County also expects to receive
approximately $278,000 in State funds under
a sub-program of RSTP; an exchange for
Federal funds. This is an annual amount
provided to counties and was considered for
elimination by the State, but is still being
funded.

This budget is recommended at $254,824.
This budget unit does not receive any funding
from the General Fund. All funding is
provided through taxes and the transfers from
the Water Zones.
A drainage study was performed in FY 2011-
12 which will continue into FY 2012-13.
However, that expense is reflected directly in
each drainage zone fund rather than as an
expense from this fund.

These budgets are recommended at a
combined amount of $6,598. These budget
units do not receive any funding from the
General Fund. All funding is provided
through charges, fees, and interest.
These budget units are recommended as
follows and include Interfund Public Works
Administration Service charges from the
Public Works budget unit (1-920).

These budget units do not receive any funding
from the General Fund. All funding is
provided through tax assessments.
In FY 2012-13, the Water Resources Division,
which manages the Zones, is requesting to
fund preliminary drainage improvement
planning efforts based upon drainage studies
of the Live Oak Canal completed in FY 2010-
11. The cost of these efforts will be
distributed as follows.

The FY 2012-13 Recommended Budget
includes a fencing and erosion control project
(Zone 4) in the amount of $33,180 and a ditch
improvement project (Zone 7) in the amount
of $10,450.
The Interfund Administration – Miscellaneous
Departments account is used to reflect charges
to the individual Zones for in-house
engineering services performed by the Water
Resources division. The FY 2012-13
Recommended Budget includes $2,070
(Zones 4 - 8) in this account related to work
performed for the Live Oak Canal
improvements.
Interfund Public Works Administration
Services are recommended at $13,319 (Zones
4-8) and include Public Works accounting and
management staff’s time spent in support of
the Sutter county Water Agency Zones 4
through 8.
Assessments within the Zones of Benefit are
reviewed and adjusted as appropriate
annually.

This budget is recommended at $5,423. This
budget unit does not receive any funding from
the General Fund.
This budget unit is financed by annual
drainage maintenance assessment fees levied
within this Zone. Although this pre-
Proposition 218 assessment has an adjustment
for inflation authorized, the adjustment was
not made in FY 2008-09 or FY 2009-10 as the
adjustments would have been so small that the
increased revenues would not have covered
the mailing expenses, so the current
assessment is less than the maximum
assessment allowed by law. No
connection/capital impact fees are collected
within the zone.

This budget is recommended at $18,864. This
budget unit does not receive any funding from
the General Fund.
The RRWF receives revenues from user fees,
currently at $45.00 per residence (equivalent
dwelling unit) per month, and an ad valorem
property tax on all parcels in the park. Annual
expenses exceed annual revenues and the fund
continues to draw down its fund balance by
approximately $10,000 per year.

This budget unit is recommended at $701,979
and includes Intrafund Administration Service
charges from the Public Works budget unit (1-
920). The General Fund provides 36% of the
financing for this budget unit and is reduced
$129,053 (34%) compared to FY 2011-12.
The recommended budget reflects a $30,000
reduction over FY 2011-12 in the Professional
and Specialized Services account. The impact
will be a reduction in study, planning and
design efforts associated with internal
drainage issues. The budgeted amount
provides for consultant costs for engineering
and legal services related to floodplain
management and drainage for the County.
The division will use consulting services in
FY 2012-13 to assist with the Integrated
Regional Water Management Plan
development.
In FY 2011-12, an Associate Engineer
position was eliminated and is recommended
to remain vacant and unfunded in FY 2012-
13. The impact includes a reduction in staff’s
capacity to plan and execute capital
improvements relating to the Drainage Zones
of Benefit. The Division Chief continues to be
responsible for critical drainage activities
previously completed by the Associate
Engineer.
There will continue to be a reduction in the
amount of Public Outreach conducted for
Floodplain Management, and other activities
associated with the Community Rating
System and Water Resource Management.
Should ownership of the Robbins Water
system transfer to a private water company as
currently proposed, the current
Water/Wastewater Operator would have more
time to assist with floodplain management
issues.
In FY 2010-11, a Public Works Equipment
Operator position was left vacant and
unfunded. The FY 2012-13 Recommended
Budget leaves this position vacant and
unfunded. This not only limits the amount of
drainage maintenance work that can be
accomplished, but also makes it more difficult
to effectively utilize the drainage revenues
being collected from the SCWA Zones of
Benefit to maintain the Live Oak Canal.
Intrafund Administration services are
recommended at $108,847 which is a
reduction of $159,817 (60%) compared to FY
2011-12. The administrative costs include
Public Works accounting and management
staff’s time spent in support of the Water
Resources Division.
Additional reductions to this budget unit,
beyond those recommended, would require
additional staff reductions and the inability for
staff to adequately provide basic services to
the County. Therefore, further reductions are
not recommended at this time.

The FY 2012-13 budget for Waterworks
District No. 1 totals $388,895. The budget
reflects the total expenditures associated with
Operations & Maintenance, Capital Expense,
and Depreciation Expense.
The majority of the District’s expenses are
associated with maintenance and operations.
This category includes supplies and materials,
electricity, chemicals, professional services,
monitoring, state permits, repair and
maintenance expenses, staff expenses for the
operator and engineering support staff, and
other costs associated with operating the water
system. There are also administrative costs
incurred by the District, such as costs
associated with performing utility billing
services and accounting for the District.
The FY 2011-12 budget that was approved by
the District’s Board of Directors included
expenses associated with the rehabilitation of
the wastewater treatment plant. Most major
budget changes reflect the completion of staff
efforts and receipt of State grant income
associated with this major project.
In 2009, monthly “interim fees” of $50.00 per
EDU (equivalent dwelling unit) for water
service and $55.00 per EDU for wastewater
service were adopted by the District’s Board
of Directors. This fiscal year, an Ad Hoc
committee appointed by the Board of
Directors is expected to investigate options to
modify the interim fees collected from the
property owners, in an effort to cover the
actual costs associated with operating the
wastewater services for the District.
Budgeted operating revenues do not include
enough revenue to meet the non-cash
Depreciation Expense of $100,447.
Historically, the replacement costs for
infrastructure have been provided by State
grants.
Currently, the District is in the process of
finalizing grant funding for a feasibility study
to upgrade the water treatment plant to
facilitate arsenic removal. The District is
under a Compliance Order for arsenic
exceedance. In order to comply with the
order, the District needs to update the water
treatment plant.
The proposed feasibility study will involve
installation of pilot wells, bench tests to
determine the effectiveness and cost of
various treatment options, and will produce a
design for a future treatment plant upgrade or
replacement. Actual construction would be
funded by a future grant.
Revenues for operations and maintenance are
not expected to cover operations and
maintenance expenditures in FY 2012-13,
resulting in a projected deficit of $154,248 for
the fiscal year. This is in addition to the
anticipated deficit for FY 2011-12, which was
considered in February of 2011 when the
Sutter County Board of Supervisors approved
an “interim” loan from the General Fund to
the District. The loan was approved up to a
maximum of $670,000 and for the period of
18 months. When approved, it was
anticipated that prior to the end to the 18
month term of the loan, the District would
refinance the loan, request the forgiveness of
all or a portion of the loan, or otherwise repay
the loan. These options will need to be
considered by the District in the coming fiscal
year.

This budget is recommended at $59,653
(when Intrafund revenue is included). The
General Fund provides less than 1% of the
financing for this budget unit and is reduced
by $3,663 (95.8%) compared to FY 2011-
12.
There are no significant changes
recommended in this budget unit. Because
this budget unit reflects only the cost of
insurance premiums which are provided to
the County by the carrier, there is no
practical ability for the County to affect
budget reductions in this budget unit in the
short-term.
This budget is recommended at $905,649.
The General Fund provides 97.5% of the
financing for this budget unit and is reduced
by $44,691 (4.8%) compared to FY 2011-
12. A portion of the costs for this budget
unit are recouped from outside and
subvented funds through the annual A-87
cost plan.
In an effort to achieve budget reductions, it
is recommended that all Extra Help funding
be eliminated for FY 2012-13. Due to
limited remaining staff, the Department will
close the public front desk during the noon
hour (from 12:30 to 1:30 p.m.) to adjust for
the loss of Extra Help front desk assistance.
The Department is reducing its Professional
and Specialized Services expenses by
$30,000. This amount reflects the reduction
to labor negotiation support that is no longer
required with the hire of the Human
Resource Director in FY 2011-12. The
Human Resources Director will act as Chief
Negotiator in future negotiations. However,
the Department has seen the increased need
for outside investigator services for
employee relations issues and alleged
discrimination or harassment concerns. The
Department recommends that should this
trend continue, those departments for whom
the investigations are being conducted be
required to directly fund the cost of the
outside investigation services.
The Department has identified a process
improvement that will provide for County
retirees’ to pay their benefit premiums
directly to the appropriate responsible party,
thus improving efficient use of staff time as
well as providing for more direct customer
service for those retirees. The cost for this
service is budgeted at $8,100 in the
Professional and Specialized Services
account. This cost will be offset by
budgeting $8,100 of the rebate funds
received from the Centers for Medicare &
Medicaid Services (CMS) Retiree Drug
Subsidy Program (RDS). The County began
receiving these funds in FY 2006-07 but had
not previously budgeted the revenue. The
balance of the CMS/RDS funds in the
amount of $42,000 is budgeted in the
General Revenues budget unit (1209).
The Department is reducing the
Employment Training expense for the
countywide Management Training and
Seminar Program by $15,000 to reflect the
free and low cost training initiatives offered
through the California State Association of
Counties and other on-line training
opportunities. The Department will bring a
recommendation to modify the Rule
language to reflect the decrease in this line
item to the Board of Supervisors at a future
date.
The Communications and Subscriptions
accounts have also been reduced by a total
of $1,000 based on a review of historic
expenses and in an effort to achieve budget
reductions.
Interfund Information Technology charges
are budgeted to increase by $39,060 due to
new costs associated with the
implementation of the new
Personnel/Payroll system. These costs are
outside of the direct control of the
department.
Additional reductions to the Human
Resources Department would require the
elimination of an additional filled position,
limiting the office’s ability to provide
adequate services to internal County
Department customers, employees and
members of the public. Further staff
reductions would also impede the
Department’s ability to meet legal
requirements regarding compliance with
employment laws. Because certain legal
requirements may not be eliminated, a
significant staffing shortage could require
the County contract for those services from
outside vendors, which would offset any
intended cost savings. Therefore, further
reductions are not recommended.
This budget is recommended at $4,067,259.
The Information Technology budget unit
operates as an ISF and must balance
revenues to expenditures within the fund.
Recommended budget reductions result in a
$66,331 (2%) decrease in the Interfund
Information Technology charges to County
departments as compared to FY 2011-12.
The Interfund Information Technology
account represents the total of all charges
made to County departments for Information
Technology services. Therefore, the
reduction of $66,331 equals the amount that
has been reduced in County Department
budgets for FY 2012-13.
The Deputy Director of Information
Technology position has been held vacant
and unfunded since FY 2010-11. Based on
Department needs, the FY 2012-13
Recommended Budget includes $102,785 to
fund the position for 9 months, with the
anticipation that the position will be filled in
October of 2012. This position traditionally
serves as the primary supervisor/manager
for the network and PC support sections and
provides contract, licensing and purchasing
support.
One vacant Computer Operator position was
also defunded in FY 2010-11. It is
recommended that this position continue to
be held vacant and unfunded.
In FY 2011-12, as part of cost saving
measures, the Department recommended the
elimination of Unrestricted Stand-by Pay,
which was partially offset by an increase in
regular Overtime. As a result, on-call and
after-hours support for the County became
the sole responsibility of the Director. This
reduction is continued in the FY 2012-13
budget.
The Department eliminated funding for
virtually all travel, training, subscriptions
and other methods of maintaining a welltrained
staff in FY 2011-12. This reduction
is continuing in FY 2012-13. While such a
reduction is possible for a short period of
time, it is not recommended that staff
training be eliminated long term. Limiting
staff training will negatively impact the
County’s ability to consider and implement
new systems, which historically are methods
by which long term cost savings, system
wide process improvements and efficiencies
are achieved across organizations.
Software License & Maintenance is
recommended at $722,084 which is an
increase of $89,485 (13%) due to increases
in the Enterprise Agreement contract. This
is a master agreement which simplifies
mandatory licensing by requiring a single
transaction to acquire licenses and allows for
volume pricing. The agreement also secures
the right to the most current version of the
products covered. This agreement has
provided more predictable software costs.
The recommended budget includes $75,640
for the first annual payment in a
recommended 5-year equipment lease
program. Due to budget constraints, the
County has delayed most large equipment
purchases. The County is currently using
several pieces of aged equipment, which are
no longer supported by a service contract. If
these equipment pieces are to fail in the near
future, replacement parts will be difficult, or
even impossible, to find. If the County were
to purchase replacement equipment outright,
the estimated cost is $350,000.
Leasing equipment is an alternative to
purchasing new equipment. Therefore, in an
effort to reduce costs for FY 2012-13, it is
recommended that the County enter into a 5-
year lease program for the pieces of
equipment identified below. A lease
agreement will be brought to the Board for
approval in the near future.
1. Storage Area Network (SAN) – The
virtualized servers use this system as
their primary storage device. Without
this storage, approximately one-half of
the servers in the County would not
function.
2. Core Routers (2) – The County’s entire
network is run by two core
router/switches originally purchased in
1999. Replacement parts, support, and
software updates are no longer available.
If either one of these devices fail, a large
portion of the County network (i.e. email,
internet, AS 400) will be
unavailable.
3. Internet DMZ servers and domain
controllers (4) – These servers are over 8
years old and are no longer supported. If
they fail, no one will be able to log into
the network and parts would have to be
purchased and configured to bring
everything back on-line.
Due to the continued delay of purchasing
replacement assets, the majority of the assets
have been fully depreciated and are no
longer expensed. Depreciation Expense is
recommended at $62,901 which is reduced
by $104,343 (63%) compared to FY 2011-
12.
The Interfund Overhead (A-87) Cost Plan is
provided by the Auditor-Controller’s office
each year. For FY 2012-13, the Information
Technology Department’s Cost Plan charges
are recommended at $132,373 which is a
reduction of $155,056 (54%) compared to
FY 2011-12.

This budget is recommended at $675,789.
The Liability Insurance budget unit operates
as an ISF and must balance revenues to
expenditures within the fund.
Recommended budget reductions result in a
$355,216 (-62.5%) decrease in the Interfund
Liability Insurance ISF premium charges to
County Departments as compared to FY
2011-12. The amount budgeted in the
Interfund Liability Insurance ISF account
reflects the total of all charges made to
County departments for liability insurance
premiums and requirements to maintain the
liability claims reserve. Therefore, the
reduction in this account equals the amount
that has been reduced in County department
budgets for FY 2012-13.
The Board of Supervisors has a funding
policy that program assets be maintained
between the 75% and 90% confidence level.
The assets of the program are projected to be
in excess of the 90% confidence level at
June 30, 2012. Because the Liability ISF
has generated a funding surplus, the
actuarial valuation recommends that the
County implement a funding plan to bring
program assets back to the desired
confidence level by June 30, 2015. The
CSAC Excess Insurance Authority standard
states that based on upon the actuarial
recommendations, the members should
maintain reserves and make funding
contributions equal to or exceeding the
expected losses and a reasonable margin for
contingencies. The recommended amount to
be set aside in FY 2012-13 for future claims
payable is $150,000. This is the same
amount set aside in FY 2011-12, but
approximately 50% lower than has been
recommended in prior years, and is
recommended as a means of reducing the
funding surplus. With this recommendation,
the County will continue to have sufficient
funds set aside in the liability claims reserve
to cover future claims payable.

This budget is recommended at $2,086,411.
Because the net costs of this fund are
allocated to all County departments,
including General Fund departments, a
significant effort has been made to maintain
costs in the Workers’ Compensation Fund.
As mentioned above, this effort to contain
current year costs is reflected in the
recommendation to hold the Safety
Coordinator position at a 60% position (0.6
FTE) for a second year, with the Risk
Manager assuming safety-related
administrative duties that are currently
performed by the Safety Coordinator. These
duties include: developing safety
communication materials and disseminating
to departments; training employees in safety
policies; investigating work place accidents
and developing corresponding accident
reports; providing consultation services to
departments to assist them in developing an
effective injury and illness prevention
program; interacting with governmental
agencies to secure and provide information
to departments; responding to Cal/OSHA
inspections and citations and represent
County at administrative hearings related to
citations.
Over 80% of the cost of the County’s
Workers’ Compensation program is driven
by insurance premium costs. This year, the

appropriation for Insurance remains the
same as in FY 2011-12. Initial insurance
premium estimates received from the carrier
indicate essentially no change over the prior
year budgeted amount. However, the
County was recently notified that it will
receive a dividend of approximately $208,
537 from the carrier based on pooled
savings, which must be applied in the
coming year. Therefore, the
recommendation for FY 2012-13 insurance
premium expense reflects this dividend as a
reduction to insurance costs.
In the 1990’s when the County was selfinsured
for worker’s compensation the
County maintained a reserve to cover related
claims. In 1998, when the County joined the
CSAC-EIA pool, a portion of the remaining
monies were used to reduce premium
charges in that year. Additionally, a portion
of the reserve funds were returned to
departments that had contributed to the
reserve, except a few. The funds that were
not returned to departments were placed in a
“trust fund.” That fund is now called the
Worker’s Compensation Dividend special
revenue fund (0-165). This fund has had no
activity other than the annual accrual of
interest. The Human Resources Department
is recommending that the fund be closed and
that the remaining money be distributed to
those funds/budget units which historic
records indicate the money came from. It is
estimated that Fund 0-165 will contain
$49,485 as of July 1, 2012. Therefore, the
budget includes an Interfund Miscellaneous
Transfer In from Fund 0-165 of $49,485,
with a credit to FY 2012-13 Workers’
Compensation charges to the following
departments: Child Support Services (budget
unit 0-112), Public Health (budget unit 4-
103), and District Attorney (budget unit 2-
125).
Additional reductions to the Workers’
Compensation budget are not recommended.
An additional reduction would require the
elimination of the Safety Coordinator
position. Complete elimination of the
Safety Coordinator position would place the
County’s safety program at risk, as all duties
currently performed by the Safety
Coordinator would be, by default,
transferred to the Risk Manager. Regular
activities such as safety inspections and
trainings would be either severely limited or
eliminated altogether, depending upon other
critical priorities that arise during the year
for the Risk Manager. Elimination of the
safety program could in turn negatively
impact the County’s claims experience and
cause an increase in premiums. Further
reductions are not recommended at this
time.
