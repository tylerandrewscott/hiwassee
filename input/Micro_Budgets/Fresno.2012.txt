On October 1, 2011, the Public Safety Realignment Act (AB 109, Chapter 15, Statutes of 2011) was signed into law. This legislation transferred responsibility for housing/supervising specified inmates and parolees from the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation to counties. The recommended budget includes full-year AB 109 funding for two jail floors for the continued implementation of the realignment of specified inmates/parolees from the State to counties.
As part of the FY 2011-12 State Budget, the Legislature enacted a series of trailer bills that realigned approximately $6.3 billion of programs from the State to Counties. The 2011 realignment includes various Public Safety and Social Services programs. Grant programs/services included in this Org that were affected by 2011 Realignment include the Local Law Enforcement Services Account (LLESA) programs of Citizens’ Option for Public Safety (COPS) Front Line Law Enforcement and Detention, Booking Fees, Cal-MMET, and Rural Crime; and Trial Court Security. In addition, AB 109 programs are funded through the Local Community Corrections Account.
In 1992, your Board authorized a resolution implementing Section 9250.14 of the Vehicle Code which permitted Fresno County to add a $1.00 assessment to vehicles registered with a Fresno County address. The funds can be used for programs which enhance the capacity of local police and prosecutors to deter, investigate and prosecute vehicle theft crimes. In 1992, your Board approved the use of the funds to address juvenile vehicle theft offenders in Fresno County by adding staffing capacity at Juvenile Flail by approximately 24 beds. Due to the spike in auto theft among adults, the recommended budget for Org 3111 includes $705,000 to implement an auto theft program for adults (these funds were previously budgeted in Probation Org 3440). The program will include the funding of three jail beds for auto theft offenders; additional Deputy Sheriff time dedicated to the Help Eliminate Auto Theft (HEAT) team; and the addition of an electronic monitoring program for up to 40 auto theft clients, which will be monitored by the HEAT team.

Significant Program Changes
As part of the FY 2011-12 State Budget, the Legislature enacted a series of trailer bills that realigned approximately $6.3 billion of programs from the State to Counties.

Based on changes in grant funding and program operations, a number of position deletions and additions are included in the recommended budget as follows:
	URBAN Program - the deletion of one Senior District Attorney Investigator position. There is no expectation of funding for the second Senior Investigator position assigned to the URBAN grant for FY 2012-13. The position is currently vacant and the deletion will not impact ongoing activities.
	Life and Annuity Fraud- the deletion of one Office Assistant position. Based on the FY 2011-12 funding allocation and the Department of Insurance’s desire to expand this program to other counties there is no expectation of funding for this position in FY 2012-13.

The FY 2011-12 Adopted Budget included state funding of $284,190, federal funding of $399,855 and county match of $282,673. However, when state revenues failed to materialize the state pulled the “trigger” and eliminated the state funding of $284,190 for this program.

Significant Program Changes
In 1992, your Board authorized a resolution implementing Section 9250.14 of the Vehicle Code which permitted Fresno County to add a $1.00 assessment to vehicles registered with a Fresno County address. The funds can be used for programs which enhance the capacity of local police and prosecutors to deter, investigate and prosecute vehicle theft crimes. In 1992, your Board approved the use of the funds to address juvenile vehicle theft offenders in Fresno County by increasing staffing capacity at Juvenile Hall by approximately 24 beds. Due to the spike in auto theft among adults, the recommended budget removes this funding source from this Org and allocates the funding (approximately $700,000) to the Sheriffs Office Org 3111 to implement an auto theft program for adults.
As part of the FY 2011-12 State Budget, the Legislature enacted a series of trailer bills that realigned approximately $6.3 billion of programs from the State to Counties.

Significant Program Changes
On April 17, 2012, the Board of Supervisors approved the reestablishment of the Department of Personnel Services effective June 25, 2012. Currently, the Personnel Services functions are administered as a division of the County Administrative Office under a separate Budget Org 1010. This structure was approved by the Board of Supervisors on April 28, 2009 and went into effect June 15, 2009 and was intended to be a short-term budgetary solution. The reestablishment of the Department of Personnel Services under direction of the Director of Personnel Services will remove the Personnel Services functions from under the umbrella of the CAO.
Due to budget reductions throughout the County and reductions in gang prevention funding from private, state, and federal grants, the Countywide Gang and Juvenile Delinquency Initiative (Initiative), which was approved by the Board of Supervisors on December 5, 2006, can no longer be funded. The CAO, through its Gang Task Force Coordinator position, has provided oversight to this Initiative over the last four years, accomplishing several milestones in the community.

Salaries and Benefits
	Salaries and Benefits, recommended at $1,605,375, reflect a 5% ($89,435) decrease from the FY 2011-12 Adopted Budget, which is primarily due to the elimination of the Economic Development Coordinator position.

Recommended funding includes:
	Account 6100 - Regular Salaries, recommended at $891,943, reflect a 7% ($62,892) decrease
from the FY 2011-12 Adopted Budget primarily due to the elimination of the Economic Development Coordinator position offset by the difference between budgeted and actual salary costs. No salary savings are recommended for FY 2012-13, which is consistent with the current year due to minimal projected turnover.
	Account 6200 - Extra-Flelp, recommended at $76,632, reflect a 27% ($27,693) decrease from
the FY 2011-12 Adopted Budget primarily due to the elimination of extra-help support associated with the County’s Economic Development responsibilities and the Commute Green Grant.
	Account 6400 - Retirement Contribution, recommended at $479,234, reflects an increase of
$1,327 over the FY 2011-12 Adopted Budget. The increase in retirement costs is primarily due to an increase in the retirement contribution rates partially offset by elimination of retirement costs associated with the Economic Development Coordinator position.
Services and Supplies
	Services and Supplies, recommended at $124,904, reflect a 71% ($312,339) decrease from the FY 2011-12 Adopted Budget primarily due to elimination of services and supplies costs associated with the Commute Green grant.

Services and Supplies
 Services and Supplies, recommended at $3,880,450, represents a 57% ($1,405,488) increase over the FY 2011-12 Adopted Budget due primarily to the $1.2M combined increase in appropriations for emergency repairs and maintenance/utility costs of vacant spaces.
Recommended funding includes:
	Maintenance-Buildings & Grounds ($750,000) - Recommended at a 400% ($600,000) increase over FY 2011-12 based on projected expenditures for emergency repairs. Reserves for emergency repairs are currently not included in the Facilities Services ISF. The ISD administers these activities.

Expenditures are for the annual independent audits required by various Government (Govt.) Codes, U.S. Govt. Auditing Standards, the Single Audit Act, and individual Federal/State grants. The audit is also necessary for the County’s bond rating and is directly related to the cost of borrowing. Reimbursements in the amount of $8,596 are expected to be received from the Transportation Authority and Zoo Authority to offset the audit costs related to their agencies. The recommended funding also allows for other expert consulting services that may be needed to complete financial statement disclosures. The ACTTC administers these activities.

	Government Finance Officers Association (GFOA) ($1,100) - Remains at the same level as FY 2011-12 and represents funding to obtain a GFOA - Certificate of Achievement, which was established to encourage local governments to go beyond minimum requirements when preparing comprehensive annual financial reports. Achieving the certificate enhances confidence in the reported financial position of the County. The ACTTC administers this activity.
	Standard & Poors ($15,000) - Remains at the same level as FY 2011-12 and represents funding to obtain bond ratings which are required in order to issue the TRAN. The ACTTC administers this activity.
	Sales Tax Recovery ($150,000) - Recommended at the same level as FY 2011-12 and reflects funding for the recovery of sales tax revenues. Contracted services include analysis to help ensure vendors properly report to the State all sales tax receipts that are applicable to the County. Increased sales tax revenues fully offset the cost of the contract. The ACTTC administers these activities.
	Trustee Fees ($11,000) - Recommended at the same level as FY 2011-12. This is needed to pay the Bank of New York for administering the Juvenile Justice Campus and Juvenile Court Facility LRBs and Pension Obligation Bonds (POB), as the County does not have the expertise or resources to perform these services. The POB portion ($4,850) is 100% offset from rates charged to the County to cover POB debt. The ACTTC administers these activities.
	Bond Counsel ($84,700) - Recommended at the same level as FY 2011-12 for services required from outside bond counsel. County Counsel does not have the expertise regarding municipal finance matters (e.g. bond issuance), and investors expect to see a nationally recognized law firm on the bond documents.

Upon request, these expenditures are later reversed from Org. 0710 and charged to Org. 2540.

	Annual Membership Dues for the Five Cities Economic Development Joint Powers Authority (JPA) ($7,240) - Recommended at the same level as FY 2011-12 for the County’s membership in the JPA.

The JPA now consists of eight members including the cities of Fowler, Kingsburg, Orange Cove, Parlier, Reedley, Sanger and Selma as well as the County of Fresno. Membership dues are proportionate to each member agency’s population. The CAO administers these activities.
	Driver Alliant Insurance Liability ($275) - Recommended at the same level as FY 2011-12 for the Retirement Board's insurance coverage. Government Code Section 7511 requires the County to pay for premiums related to the non-recourse clause of fiduciary liability insurance for the Fresno County Employees’ Retirement Association (FCERA) Board and Administrator. The Code prohibits a public retirement plan from paying this charge. The bill is received from FCERA and processed by the CAO.
	Council of Governments (COG) Membership Dues ($15,500) - Recommended at the same level as FY 2011-12 for annual membership dues that are required through the COG Joint Powers Agreement (JPA), not by State or Federal law. COG (a mandated State and Federal-designated Regional Transportation and Metropolitan Planning agency) currently uses the dues for State and Federal lobbying efforts, which therefore cannot be funded from the Road Fund. Participation in the JPA is necessary for the County to have a voice in regional decision-making and programming of hundreds of millions of regional and local transportation funding. The CAO administers this item.
	Facility Operation & Maintenance for Vacant Spaces ($2,000,000) - Reflects a 44% ($610,000) increase over the FY 2011-12 Adopted Budget based on updated actual and estimated costs of utilities, maintenance and vandalism of vacant County building spaces including University Medical Center, Elkhorn bootcamp, 10th Street Juvenile Hall/Court facilities, and the old Coroner facility. These estimates could be reduced or offset as a result of the Board's direction to consider the sale, lease or increased use of County properties. The costs do not benefit specific entities and therefore cannot be charged to departments or grants. As such, the Facility Services ISF would not be able to recover revenues for these costs, so funding for this purpose needs to be absorbed by the General Fund (Org. 2540, Account 7345). The ISD administers this activity.
	Transportation, Travel & Education ($2,000) - Recommended at the same level as FY 2011-12 based on current expenditure estimates. The funding is needed for travel costs in order to get Standard & Poors bond ratings associated with TRAN borrowing. County staff also consult with investors regarding the TRAN program and the issuance of bonds. This expenditure Account (7415) is also used to pay for American Express Corporate Card travel expenditures. Charges are then reversed and charged to applicable departments. This activity is primarily administered by the ACTTC.
	Public Safety Realignment Act (AB 109) Planning Grant ($200,000) - Reflects a 100% ($200,000) increase over the FY 2011-12 Adopted Budget to provide reimbursement for the planning grant activities of various County departments.

 Other Charges, recommended at $1,274,399, represent an 84% ($6,454,965) decrease from the FY

This funding was made available in budget hearings for FY 2011-12 to backfill VLF and salary reduction (budgeted vs. actual) shortfalls, and is not recommended for FY 2012-13. The funding was 100% utilized in the current year.
	IHSS State Payment ($0) - Reflects a 100% ($1,761,956) decrease from the FY 2011-12 Adopted Budget. This was budgeted in FY 2011-12 to fund the payment to the State for the mandated County share-of-cost for the IHSS Program, and is not recommended for FY 2012-13. The appropriation was eliminated during FY 2011-12 as payment was authorized in FY 2010-11.
	General Relief Caseload Growth Set Aside ($0) - Reflects a 100% ($577,296) decrease from the FY 2011-12 Adopted Budget. Funding for this purpose is not recommended for FY 2012-13.

	Fresno-Madera Area Agency on Aging (FMAAA) ($44,509) - Remains at the same level as FY 2011-12. This reflects Fresno County's financial share of a Joint Powers Agreement between the County, City of Fresno, and the County of Madera to provide the FMAAA’s required match which allows the FMAAA to receive Federal and State funding for the provision of senior services. The CAO administers this activity.
	Economic Development Contract (EDC) ($25,000) - Recommended at the same level as FY 2011-12 for EDC to continue implementing non-mandated economic development marketing programs and promoting job creation in Fresno County, consistent with the economic element of the General Plan. The CAO administers this activity.

The agreement continues to provide the County with a funding out option if funding is not available, which the Board can exercise during budget hearings. Based on funding shortfalls, it is recommended that the Board exercise this option and budget $0 for FY 2012-13. The CAO administers this activity.
Interest & Miscellaneous Expenditures -- 2540
	415 Retirement Replacement Plan ($115,049) - Budgeted at the same level as FY 2011-12 for payments to past County of Fresno employees who have retired and have compensation above the IRS tax limit for retirement.

The costs are fully offset by a reimbursement to Org. 2540, which is made available from a like reduction in the retirement contribution to FCERA. The ACTTC administers this activity.
	Outside Counsel ($210,000) - Budgeted at a 42% ($150,000) decrease from the FY 2011-12 Adopted Budget based on the projected cost of obtaining outside legal services for the County. During FY 2011-12, appropriations were reduced by $150,000 to provide funding to offset the Salaries and Benefits shortfall in County Counsel Org. 0710 and based on projected outside counsel expenditures. Funding for this purpose is necessary for certain cases where County Counsel does not have the expertise or resources. County Counsel administers these activities, and when needed, requests that the CAO transfer appropriations from Org. 2540 to County Counsel Org. 0710 where expenditures are incurred. Such transfer requests are presented to the Board for approval.
	Volunteer Fire Department Contribution ($11,250) - Remains at the same as FY 2011-12, and represents the County's non-mandated contribution to five Volunteer Fire Departments (i.e. Big Creek, Hume Lake, Huntington Lake, Mountain Valley and Pine Ridge) to purchase various types of firefighting clothing and equipment. The CAO administers these activities.
	Amador Plan Fire Services ($840,091) - Recommended at a 10% ($94,909) decrease from the FY 2011-12 Adopted Budget based on the proposed agreement with CAL FIRE for FY 2012-13. Similar to FY 2011-12, funding provides for non-mandated fire protection services during the nonfire season (generally November through May) at four of five fire stations located in select foothill and mountain areas including Hurley, Blasingame, Shaver Lake, and Squaw Valley. The Piedra station is proposed for closure. Payments under this agreement are based on actual costs, which are contingent on the length of the fire season. The agreement with CAL FIRE is presented to the Board during the fiscal year for retroactive approval. The CAO administers these activities.
	Cash Shortages ($1,000) - Recommended at the same level as FY 2011-12 based on actual and projected expenditures. Based on Management Directive 740, cash shortage reimbursements to County departments have been budgeted in Org 2540. Shortages are recommended for approval if there is no proof of fraud or gross negligence and the loss is not covered by insurance. The ACTTC administers these activities.
	Judgements and Damages ($5,000) - Recommended at the same level as FY 2011-12 based on actual and projected expenditures. Represents the County's obligation under California Commercial Code Division 3 to reimburse businesses for fraudulent or forged checks. The ACTTC administers this activity.
Other Financing Uses
 Other Financing Uses is recommended at $6,591,964, which reflects a 6% ($391,960) increase over
the FY 2011-12 Adopted Budget. This is primarily due to a projected increase in interest costs for
issuance of the Tax and Revenue Anticipation Notes (TRAN).
Recommended funding includes:
	Operating Transfer Out to ISF ($249,077) reflects an 11% ($24,227) increase over FY 2011-12 based on ITSD rates provided to fund PeopleSoft financial system charges for Schools and Cemetery Districts. Government Code Section 6103 and Health & Safety Code section 9028 support that the County does not have the authority to charge such Districts for performing the Districts' data processing. ISD administers these activities. 
 Operating Transfer Out to Debt Service ($6,342,887) reflects a 6% ($367,733) increase over FY 2011-12. This is primarily due to the estimated amount budgeted for TRAN interest ($2,700,000) which reflects a 16% ($373,000) increase over FY 2011-12 and is based on a $90M debt issuance at 3%. Once confirmed, if the final TRAN debt issuance amount and interest rate result in a debt requirement that is less than what is budgeted, any savings would be available for reappropriation as approved by the Board. In addition, there is also a $747 increase in the County’s 41.5% share of the debt service payment related to the Juvenile Court Facility LRBs ($1,695,472). The Superior Court shares in the use of the facility, and their share of the debt payment (58.5%), is funded by the Administrative Office of the Courts through Court Ancillary Services Org. 2838. The County’s share of debt is offset by up to $500,000 in annual Civil Assessment Fee revenues received from the Superior Court. These increases are partially offset by a $6,014 decrease in the debt requirement for the Juvenile Justice Campus LRBs ($1,947,415) compared to FY 2011-12. More information on the above debt service payments is available in the Narrative for Org. 0124 - Debt Service. The ACTTC administers these activities.

Significant Program Changes
There are no significant program changes compared to FY 2011-12.
Other Charges
 The following provides a summary of recommended funding for the County’s long and short-term debt obligations, which includes the required FY 2012-13 debt service payments for three different issuances of LRBs and the TRAN:
Juvenile Justice Campus LRBs (Account 7864)
A total of $26 million in LRBs was issued by the Fresno County Financing Authority in 2004 to fund a portion of the costs associated with the construction of the County’s $141 million Juvenile Justice Campus. The bonds had a 20-year maturity and included two years of capitalized interest. The total debt service payment for FY 2012-13 is $1,947,415 and is due in two installments: principal and interest in August 2012 and interest only in February 2013. See debt service calendar following this narrative for the current and long-term annual debt service amounts.
Downtown Energy Savings Project LRBs (Account 7865)
A total of $14,375,000 in LRBs were issued by the Fresno County Financing Authority in 2004 to fund the costs associated with the Downtown Energy Savings Project. The bonds had a 15-year maturity and included capitalized interest during the construction period (17 months). The total debt service payment for FY 2012-13 is $1,310,575 and is due in two installments: principal and interest in August 2012 and interest only in February 2013. See debt service calendar following this narrative for the current and long-term annual debt service amounts. 
The recommended amount of $1,310,575 reflects a $2,925 decrease from FY 2011-12.
Juvenile Court Facility LRBs (Account 7853)
A total of $55,350,000 in LRBs were issued by the Fresno County Financing Authority in 2007 to finance costs associated with the construction of a shared use Juvenile Court Facility and offices to be located at the JJC. Usage of the Juvenile Court Facility is being shared by Fresno County and the Superior Court. The total principal amount of the Annual Base Rental (Lease) Payments is $55,350,000 and is to be paid by the County. The County leases a portion of the facility and offices to the Administrative Office of the Courts (AOC), whose share of the Base Rental Payments (i.e. 58.5%) is to be paid directly to the Trustee and credited against the total Base Rental Payments made by the County. The bonds have a 23-year maturity and include two years of capitalized interest. The total debt service payment for FY 2012-13 is $4,085,473 and is due in two installments: principal and interest in October 2012 and interest only in April 2013. See debt service calendar following this narrative for the current and long-term annual debt
service amounts.
 (NOTE: An additional $1 has been budgeted in the PeopleSoft financial system for rounding purposes reflecting a budget total of $4,085,474.) The AOC’s share of the $4,085,474 is $2,390,002 (58.5%), and the County’s share is $1,695,472 (41.5%). The recommended amount of $4,085,474 reflects a $1,800 increase over FY 2011-12.
Tax Revenue Anticipation Notes (TRAN) (Account 7867)
For the past 34 years, the Board of Supervisors has authorized a short-term borrowing program through the issuance of a TRAN. The TRAN enables the County to maintain a positive cash flow until anticipated taxes and revenues are received throughout the fiscal year.
The recommended funding of $2,700,000 for FY 2012-13 is based on an assumed $90,000,000 debt issuance at a 3% interest rate. This represents a 16% ($373,000) increase over the FY 2011-12 Adopted Budget. If the final debt issuance amount and interest rate for FY 2012-13 result in a debt requirement that is significantly less than what is budgeted, any savings would be available for re-appropriation as approved by the Board.
Upon receipt, TRAN funds are deposited into an interest bearing account. Funding for the interest payment is transferred from the Interest and Miscellaneous Expenditures budget, where it is budgeted as net County cost.
Pension Obligation Bonds (POB)
Fresno County has issued POBs on three occasions. In March 1998, Fresno County issued $184,910,000 of taxable POBs with an 11-year amortization to fund the Unfunded Actuarial Accrued Liability (UAAL) of the Fresno County Employee’s Retirement Association. In March 2002, these bonds were partially refunded in order to extend the debt servicing of the bonds to an 18-year amortization period to provide budget relief. In addition, in 2004, a total of $327,897,749 in fixed rate bonds were issued with a 30-year amortization, and a total of $75 million in variable rate bonds were issued. The $75 million variable rate bonds were converted to fixed rate bonds on September 12, 2006 at a fixed rate of 5.56%. The maturity schedule of the converted bonds remained the same. In FY 2008-09 the debt service for the 1998 POBs was completed. The County is currently paying the annual debt service for
Debt Service - 0124
three POB issuances. A total of $36,773,375 in debt service payments is required in FY 2012-13, which includes all administration fees associated with the bonds. See debt service calendar and remaining maturity for all three issuances following this narrative.

Amounts necessary to timely pay the POB debt service payments have been incorporated into the County’s FY 2012-13 retirement rates and are collected from departments each pay period.
Contingencies
	Contingencies are recommended at $500,468, which reflects a 33% ($249,532) decrease from the FY 2011-12 Adopted Budget. The FY 2011-12 Adopted Budget of $750,000 was increased by $14,862 as a result of Board action on August 30, 2011. The current year increase reflects a transfer from the Department of Public Health Org 5620 due to the difference between the budgeted and actual cost of the FY 2011-12 Agreement with the Central California Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (CCSPCA). On October 25, 2011, the Board approved a $223,236 appropriations decrease to cover the cost of the Probation Department’s relocation from the Main Courthouse to the County Plaza Building and Tenth Street Building 514 ($215,726) and to pay Jack Faucett Associates for past services provided related to the preparation of the final Environmental Impact Report (EIR) for the Fresno Regional Enterprise Zone ($7,510).
General Reserves
	A $1,520,000 contribution to the General Reserves is recommended for FY 2012-13. With this contribution, the General Reserves balance will increase to $12,943,004. On December 13, 2011, the Board approved the sale of County property at 205 N. Blackstone, Fresno, CA, formerly known as the Apollo Building, to Fresno Renaissance, an assignee of the Housing Authority of the City of Fresno. Proceeds from this sale ($800,000) were directed to be used to increase the General Reserves of the General Fund. Payment of $800,000 was received by the County on December 16, 2011. On October 26, 2010, the Board directed that the sale proceeds of the Consulate Building be used to increase General Reserves. On February 21, 2012, the final sale of the Consulate Building was adopted by the Board via a Public Auction. Sale proceeds net of closing costs ($175,351) were received by the County on April 3, 2012. Total funds received from the sale of the Apollo Building and Consulate Building ($975,351) were deposited in the Discretionary Revenues Org 0415 during FY 2011-12. As a result, the General Reserves increased to $11,423,004 during FY 2011-12 and will further increase to $12,943,004 as a result of the FY 2012-13 recommended increase of $1,520,000. Recommended contributions to the General Reserves include $1,000,000 to address potential, 
Contingencies, General Reserves, & Designations -- 8210
future, disallowance of Pension Obligation Bond (POB) costs claimed to third party funding sources, such as federal grants, for a portion of refinanced pension obligation bonds. Principles governing federal cost reimbursements are set out in Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-87 (A-87). OMB A-87 treats pension plan costs as fringe benefits that are allowable to be claimed. However, the County of Fresno refinanced certain POB’s prior to the issuance of guidelines relative to allowable costs. To date, no federal claims have been denied reimbursement for reasons concerning claiming of POB costs. In the event that this issue can be resolved without utilizing net County cost dollars, it is the CAO’s recommendation that this $1,000,000 be utilized towards the $5,569,391 Proposition 42 Maintenance-of-Effort payment due to be paid in full to the Road Fund before June 30, 2015.
Designations
 No designation amounts have been released to be made available as an additional available funding source for the General Fund nor have any amounts been set aside to mitigate any pending factors.
Note: The FY 2011-12 adopted Fiscal Summary incorrectly reflected a $500,000 General Fund Designation Draw as a funding source for FY 2011-12. The FY 2011-12 Narrative correctly stated that no designation amounts had been released to be made available as an additional funding source for the General Fund.

	Taxes ($205,012,357) - receipt of Tax Revenues are estimated at a ($124,743) net increase over the FY 2011-12 Adopted Budget. Sales and Use Taxes are projected to increase 10% (1,307,425) based on the improving economic activity in the County and Property Tax revenues (Current Secured) are projected to increase 4% ($2,343,045). In addition, Teeter Program revenues reflect a net decrease of $5,401,769 from the FY 2011-12 Adopted Budget. This net decrease is composed of a $9,401,769 decrease due to the collection of prior year revenues budgeted in FY 2011-12, which is offset by projected ongoing Teeter Program Revenues of $4,000,000 in the budget year.
	Licenses, Permits, and Franchises ($4,336,355) - represents an ($20,000) increase over FY 2011-12 due to an increase in development services fees.
	Revenue From Use of Money and Property ($3,795,299) - represents a 1% ($51,450) decrease from FY 2011-12 due to a decrease in interest earnings as projected by the Auditor-Controller/Treasurer- Tax Collector (AC/TTC) based upon current interest rates, economic activity, economic forecasts and comments by the Federal Reserve Board for FY 2012-13.
	Intergovernmental Revenues-State ($28,608,587) - represents a 30% ($12,307,518) decrease from FY 2011-12. Key revenues in this category include the following:
 State Health and Welfare Realignment ($25,371,583) - these revenues, which are derived from Vehicle License Fees (VLF), are recommended at a 33% ($12,329,714) decrease from the FY 2011-12 Adopted Budget. As required by statute, the revenues are deposited into the County’s General Fund, but must be used to finance match requirements for the receipt of State Health and Welfare Realignment Sales Tax revenues. As a result, they are transferred to the Local Health and Welfare Trust Fund and are not available to finance General Fund costs that fall
Countywide Revenues -- 0415
outside the identified health, mental health, and social services program areas. Assembly Bill (AB) 118 redirected the portion of VLF and Sales Tax revenues that were intended for mental health programs into the newly established CalWORKs Assistance Maintenance-of-Effort (MOE) Account in the Local Health and Welfare Trust Fund. As the State does not distinguish between the Sales Tax and VLF portions of the new CalWORKs Assistance MOE, for FY 2012-13, $10,790,885 in VLF will be deposited directly to the Local Health and Welfare Trust Fund instead of passing it through the General Fund as in previous years. This is an accounting change only due to 2011 Realignment. The balance of the decrease ($1,538,829) is due to a projected 6% decline in VLF revenues for FY 2012-13.
 Tobacco Settlement Funds ($2,105,000) - this revenue is recommended at the same level as FY 2011-12 based on receipts of Tobacco Settlement funds. Tobacco Settlement revenues are used to partially finance the General Fund match required before receiving Health and Mental Health Realignment revenues.
	Intergovernmental Revenue-Federal ($1,900,000) - this revenue is projected at the same level as the FY 2011-12 Adopted Budget for Federal In-Lieu Taxes.
	Charges for Services ($555,395) - estimated at a 78% ($2,024,985) decrease from the FY 2011-12 Adopted Budget based on cost allocations included in the Countywide Cost Allocation Plan.
	Miscellaneous Revenues ($10,000) - reflects a net 99% ($1,333,231) decrease from FY 2011-12 primarily due to one-time receipt of Short-Doyle/MediCal program funds in FY 2011-12 as a result of an audit appeal and subsequent adjustment for FY 2003-04.

Salaries and Benefits
	Salaries and Benefits, recommended at $2,288,684, reflect an 8% ($165,397) increase over the FY 2011-12 Adopted Budget, which is primarily due to increases to retirement contribution rates and differences between budget instructions and actuals in current year salaries.
Recommended funding includes:
	Staffing at 23 positions, which is the same level as the current year.
	A projected 1% ($12,989) salary savings from attrition throughout the year.
	A net 7% ($81,446) increase to Account 6100, Regular Salaries primarily due to actual salary reductions negotiated at a different amount than budgeted in FY 2011-12.
	A net 13% ($78,348) increase to Account 6400, Retirement Contribution primarily due to increased retirement rates and higher salaries (subject to retirement) resulting from the difference between actual negotiated reductions and those budgeted in FY 2011-12.
	A net 24% ($6,723) reduction to Account 6550, Workers’ Compensation Contribution resulting from a reduction to the rate assessed by Risk Management.
Services and Supplies
	Services and Supplies, recommended at $638,140 reflect a 29% ($142,612) increase over the FY 2011-12 Adopted Budget primarily due to increases to pass-through reimbursable costs associated with a significant increase in recruitment and pre-employment activities for the Sheriff and Probation Department positions triggered by the 2011 Public Safety Realignment Act (AB 109). A portion of the increase to services and supplies is also attributable to increased Facilities and Security ISF rates. 
Personnel Services --1010
Recommended funding includes:
	$345,500 in appropriations (54% of recommended Services and Supplies) for projected passthrough or reimbursable costs for which equal revenue has been included in revenue projections, resulting in no net County cost. Reimbursable costs include recruitment advertising, written examinations, pre-employment medical and psychological exams, and a portion of costs related to the Civil Service Commission. This amount reflects a 53% ($120,100) increase over current year, based on increased recruitment and pre-employment demands resulting from AB 109, which are estimated to continue through FY 2012-13.
	A 35% ($4,351) decrease to Account 7040, Telephone Charges as estimated by ISD based on current year usage.
	A 35% ($1,022) decrease to Account 7175, Insurance-Other resulting from a reduction to the rate assessed by Risk Management.
	A 28% ($11,703) increase to Account 7345, Facility Operation and Maintenance and a 22% ($3,091) increase to Account 7611, Security Services based on the rates assessed by ISD.
Salaries and Benefits
 Salaries and Benefits, recommended at $2,526,732 reflect a 6% ($135,373) increase over the FY 2011-12 Adopted Budget, which is primarily due to increases to retirement contribution rates and higher salaries than budgeted in current year.
Recommended funding includes:
	Staffing at 27 positions, which is the same level as the current year.
	A net 5% ($64,756) increase to Account 6100, Regular Salaries primarily due to actual salary reductions negotiated at a different amount than budgeted in FY 2011-12.
Risk Management -- 8925
	A net 13% ($85,272) increase to Account 6400, Retirement Contribution due to increased retirement rates and higher salaries (subject to retirement) resulting from the difference between actual negotiated reductions and those budgeted in FY 2011-12.
	A 36% ($17,282) decrease to Account 6550, Workers’ Compensation Contribution based on established Risk Management rates for FY 2012-13.
	A 22% ($4,246) decrease to Account 6350, Unemployment Insurance based on established Risk Management rates for FY 2012-13.
	A 6% ($11,350) decrease to Account 6600, Health insurance Contribution driven by waivers of health insurance coverage by current employees.
Services and Supplies
 Services and Supplies, recommended at $94,768,222, represent a 6% ($6,330,924) decrease from the FY 2011-12 Adopted Budget due primarily to a decrease in projected payments to health plans for active employees and their dependents (pass-through expense). Part of this decrease is associated with the Superior Court ceasing participation in the County’s health insurance plans in December 2011.
Recommended funding includes:
	Appropriations of $70,051,888, which reflect a 9% ($6,915,851) decrease from current year, are for Countywide health premium payments for active and retired employees. This amount includes both the employer and employee portion of health premiums as the full premium amount must be accounted for within the Risk Management fund.
	Projected Vehicle Damage program costs of $118,254, an increase of 137% ($68,254) over current year. This projected cost increase is based on recent trends of increased vehicle damage claims filed by County departments.
	Projected Professional and Specialized Services costs of $2,318,099, an increase of 22% ($424,803) over current year primarily associated with projected increases to third-party administration costs.
	Projected General Liability program costs of $3,095,000, a decrease of 8% ($254,185) from current year. This estimate is based on funding of the General Liability Program at a 70% confidence level as established by the Board of Supervisors.
	Projected Medical Malpractice program costs of $262,000, a decrease of 18% ($55,420) from current year based on estimates by the most recent actuary report.

Significant Program Changes
The Revenue Collections unit is being reorganized by eliminating Supervising Account Clerk and Collections Supervisor positions. The unit’s supervision will be assigned to Supervising Accountant position transferred from Financial Reporting and Audits division. This reorganization will allow more flexibility as one person will oversee all of the various collection processes and it will increase uniformity of operations.
Elimination of three Account Clerk and one Collection Representative positions (which are all currently vacant) in the Revenue Collections unit has resulted in lost opportunities to collect additional revenues for the County of Fresno, however efficiencies in operations have resulted in maintaining budgeted collections.
General and Special Accounting will continue with reduced office hours to the public and other County employees (9 a.m. to 12 p.m. and 1 p.m. to 4 p.m.). The reduced office hours will allow staff additional time within the day to process workload.
Elimination of one Account Clerk position in the General Accounting unit will impact customer service and result in delays in the following processes: vendor maintenance approvals for departments for accounts payable processing, 1099 maintenance, sales and use tax processing, daily flash reporting to County entities regarding fiscal operations, bi-weekly data entry for payroll deductions, processing subpoena payroll record requests, review/scanning of payroll documents, and front counter and telephone customer service (for County vendors, employees, and departments).
Cross training of staff (between property tax and accounts payable functions) will be impacted as staff will have less time to assist or train in other areas during peak times.
Transfer of debt service payments from Special Accounting to the Treasurer division will allow for additional cost recovery.
Additional staff resources will be dedicated to the Redevelopment Agency (RDA) Dissolution process for the implementation of ABX1 26-SA. The current legislation allows for a revenue offset.
Additional staffing resources will be required to implement enhanced reporting requirements for Health Care Reform Act, Federal and State reporting and withholding requirements for vendors and employees and financial/human resource systems for changes in labor memorandums of understanding agreements. These activities are not revenue offset.
Although funding has recently been provided to help enhance PeopleSoft support functions in the department and reduce delays in processes, the elimination of one Accounting Technician position in the General Accounting unit will impact accounting processing and systems support and result in some delays in the following processes: testing, training and implementation of accounting systems upgrades, fixes and interface systems, County labor MOU unit updates, processing of monthly/annual accounting closing process and postings, and accounting systems technical support to County departments.
Streamline of processes allowed elimination of one Account Clerk position in MediCal Administration activities and Targeted Case Management (MAA/TCM) unit.
Salaries and Benefits
	Salaries and Benefits, recommended at $8,469,219 represent a net of less than 1% ($5,403) increase over the FY 2011-12 Adopted Budget primarily due to an increase in Retirement, partially offset by decreases in Regular Salaries, Workers’ Compensation and Health Insurance costs. Also, included is a 2% ($166,882) salary and related benefit savings.
Recommended funding includes:
	Account 6100, Regular Salaries reflect a 1% ($66,493) decrease primarily due to reduction in staffing levels, partially offset by increases due to actual salary reductions negotiated at a different amount than budgeted in FY 2011-12.

	Account 6400, Retirement Contribution reflects a 6% ($144,975) increase due to increases in rates and higher salaries resulting from the difference between actual negotiated reductions and those budgeted in FY 2011-12, partially offset by reduced staffing levels.
	Account 6550, Workers’ Compensation reflects a 52% ($33,458) decrease based on utilization.
	Account 6600, Health Insurance Contribution reflects a 6% ($40,480) decrease due to reduction in staffing levels.
	Account 6670, Benefit Administration reflects a 23% ($2,745) increase due to increases in rates. Services and Supplies
	Services and Supplies, recommended at $2,717,050 represent a net 11% ($272,117) increase from the FY 2011-12 Adopted Budget. Significant changes by account are noted below.
Recommended funding includes:
	Account 7040, Telephone Charges, reflect an 18% ($7,068) decrease due to decreased rates.
	Account 7101, General Liability Insurance reflects a 77% ($35,135) decrease due to decreased rates.
	Account 7205, Maintenance-Equipment reflects a 13% ($2,523) increase due to increases in vendors’ cost for providing services.
	Account 7268, Postage reflects an 11% ($41,163) increase primarily due to performing a delinquent property tax sale which was postponed for one year in FY 2011-12.
	Account 7286, PeopleSoft Human Resources Charge reflects a 16% ($2,456) increase primarily due to rate increases.
	Account 7288, Data Processing Direct reflects a 17% ($51,623) increase primarily for paying Collections Systems (CUBS) for the maintenance and support of the CUBS. During FY 2011-12 the fee was paid with prepaid funds on deposit with CUBS.
	Account 7295, Professional & Specialized Services reflect a 40% ($227,362) increase primarily for the Internet auction and title search fees association with performing a delinquent property tax sale which was postponed for one year in FY 2011-12.

Significant Program Changes
The Assessor-Recorder is deleting one Senior Appraiser and one Chief Office Assistant positions to consolidate and better reflect department management and supervisorial needs. The department is also adding two Office Assistant positions to enhance staff production in the analysis of recorded documents that determine if the property transfer is a reassessable event and for other needed clerical duties. These are all 100% net County cost (NCC) funded positions resulting in NCC savings of $127,547 which has been used to offset other budgetary needs.
The Assessor is in the acquisition process for a new, modern Property Tax System to replace the County’s existing legacy system. Implementation should begin during this fiscal year.
Salaries and Benefits
 Salaries and Benefits, recommended at $11,237,250, represent a 4% ($420,627) increase over the FY 2011-12 Adopted Budget, which is primarily due to differences between budget instructions and actuals in current year salaries, and projected increases in Retirement Contributions and extra-help. Staffing is recommended at 127 positions. A 1% salary savings has been budgeted.
Recommended funding includes:

Significant Program Changes
To maximize opportunities to provide needed services to County departments and optimize the use of available resources, County Counsel will be recommending the addition of two additional attorney positions and one secretary position. The two attorneys will not only allow County Counsel to increase its projected FY 2012-13 revenues but also increase capacity for additional services to County departments. The additional secretary position is critical in allowing the department to more timely provide legal services and meet its aggressive revenue projections. In addition, County Counsel will be filling an Office Assistant position, that will be now be funded by the Department of Social Services to assist in timely maintenance of Child Protective Services (CPS) files and other necessary clerical functions to support County Counsel’s CPS attorneys.

There are approximately 300 polling sites budgeted for this election, which is a comparable level to the 2008 Presidential Election. In anticipation of high voter turnout for this election, an additional precinct officer is being added to polling places with more than two precincts to serve as a traffic director. The City of Clovis election, scheduled for March 5, 2013 for an estimated cost of $152,420, is 100% revenue offset. In an effort to offset up to $30,000 of the cost of staffing supported by net County cost during the off election cycle (January - June 2013), the County Clerk will redistribute off cycle election workers to partner with the Assessor/Recorder in completing a special project for the Recorder.
Records Management - The operation continues to work with departments to maintain and manage over 46,000 boxes of records in a setting that is HIPAA compliant. On April 24, 2012, the Board approved the elimination of responsibility for Central Warehouse to purchase copy paper for sale to County departments and transferred the responsibility to the Graphic Communications Division of the Internal Services Department, effective July 1, 2012. Also approved was the consolidation of the remaining warehouse functions with Records Management. The delivery truck, forklift and Warehouse Inventory System will also be eliminated from the program.

Significant Program Changes
As part of the consolidation of Internal Services, Org 0130-GSA Administration was dissolved and 10 of the 11 positions that were in that Org were transferred to this budget unit. In addition, with the implementation of an integrated voice and data system, voice communication will increasingly be seen as an extension of a computer based service rather than a completely separate service. Over time, as the implementation progresses, voice communications will migrate from its separate budget unit and become an inherent part of networked services. Four positions from Org 8930/31-Communications were transferred to this budget unit during the current year.
Salaries and Benefits
Salaries and Benefits are recommended at $12,416,563 and represent a 20% ($2,110,498) increase over the current year.

The funds directed to the County Local Revenue Fund 2011 and the established accounts and sub-accounts are to be used exclusively to fund realigned programs as per statute.
The Health and Human Services Account and seven subaccounts impacted existing programs administered by the Department of Social Services, including Adult Protective Services, Adoptions Services, Child Welfare Services, Child Abuse Prevention programs, Foster Care Administration, Foster Care Assistance, and Aid to Adoptions Assistance. Prior to 2011 Realignment, these programs had Federal, State, and County share-of-cost funded through either 1991 Realignment or net County cost (including a Maintenance of Effort (MOE) requirement). 2011 Realignment transferred the former State share-of-cost to the County to be funded through 2011 Realignment funding streams; Federal share-of- cost and pre-2011 County share-of-cost were not impacted.
Total net County share-of-cost included in the FY 2012-13 DSS Recommended Budget after the offset of the department’s contribution to general Countywide overhead ($673,873) is ($31,883,224), which is funded with 2011 Social Services Realignment ($17,996,716), 1991 Social Services Realignment ($13,131,856) and net County cost ($754,652). This represents an increase of 173% ($20,219,077) over the FY 2011-12 Adopted County Share ($11,664,147). Prior to Realignment 2011 legislation, the County share-of-cost for this recommended budget would have been $13,886,508, which is comprised of 1991 Realignment ($13,131,856) and net County cost ($754,652).

Significant Program Changes
Assembly Bill 118 (2011 Realignment) directed counties to create a County Local Revenue Fund in which funds will be deposited to be used exclusively to fund realigned programs, including the Aid to Adoptions program. Since the implementation of 2011 Realignment, the former State share-of-cost of 37.5% for Federally eligible cases and 75% for non-Federally eligible cases was transferred to the County to be funded through 2011 Realignment funding streams. Prior to 2011 Realignment, the County mandated share-of-cost for this recommended budget would have been $3,777,189, which is comprised of 1991 Realignment ($539,830) and net County cost ($3,237,359) for the FY 2012-13 budget and represents a $458,806 (14%) increase over FY 2011-12 adopted County share. However, with implementation of 2011 Realignment, the County’s share-of-cost for Aid to Adoptions increased to $15,098,621 which is comprised of 1991 Realignment revenues ($539,830), 2011 Realignment revenues ($11,321,432) and net County cost of $3,237,359.
In the litigation case of California State Foster Parent Association v. William Liqhtbourne, et al, the courts ruled that the State increase the Foster Family Home rates by an average of 30%. Aid to Adoptions assistance payments are based on foster home rates. The FY 2012-13 Recommended Budget includes an estimated 240 new adoptions that will be eligible for the higher rates at an estimated cost increase of $50,281. As a result of the same litigation, the entire caseload is eligible for an annual California Necessities Index (CNI) increase. The State has estimated that for FY 2012-13, the CNI increase will be 3.23%, which results in increased cost of $843,281.
DSS - Aid to Adoptions - 6415 Other Charges
 Recommended funding of $26,972,286 represents a 14% ($3,402,783) increase over the current year based on current year caseloads and average grant projections. The average caseload includes 21 cases currently participating in the SB 163 Wraparound program in lieu of group home placement.
	The budgeted Aid to Adoptions caseload reflects 6% (151) caseload growth over the current year’s projected cases of 2,407 per month to 2,558 cases per month in FY 2012-13 based on current caseload trends.
Recommended funding includes:
	Federal Aid to Adoptions cases budgeted at $23,730,773, an increase of $3,130,882 over the current year budget, to finance a monthly average of 2,256 cases at an average grant of $876.
	Non-Federal Aid to Adoptions cases budgeted at $3,241,513, an increase of $271,901 over the current year budget, to finance a monthly average of 302 cases at an average grant of $894.

Significant Program Changes
Assembly Bill (AB) 118 (2011 Realignment) legislation authorized funds that otherwise would be deposited into the Mental Health subaccount under 1991 Realignment, to be deposited into the newly established CalWORKs Maintenance-of-Effort (MOE) subaccount. Counties are to utilize these funds to pay an increased contribution towards CalWORKs Assistance grants, effective July 1, 2011. With AB 118, a portion of the state’s share-of-cost for the CalWORKs program is shifted (realigned) to the County as its MOE contribution and offset with the recently established 2011 Realignment funds. The FY 201112 CalWORKs Assistance MOE, which is currently estimated at $28,887,452, will be fixed at the amount of sales tax and Vehicle License Fee (VLF) counties receive through August of 2012.
Prior to 2011 Realignment legislation, CalWORKs assistance payments were funded 97.5% with federal ($65,927,104) and state share-of-cost ($87,696,943) and the County mandated share-of-cost contribution would have been 2.5% ($3,942,493), comprised of 1991 Realignment ($1,385,629) and net County cost ($2,556,864). The FY 2012-13 County share as calculated prior to 2011 Realignment ($3,942,493) represents a $307,066 (7%) decrease from FY 2011-12 Adopted Budget County share of $4,249,559. However, with implementation of 2011 Realignment legislation, the County’s share-of-cost for CalWORKs increased to $32,829,945 due to the realignment of $28,887,452 in State share-of-cost to County share and the existing 2.5% County share-of-cost of $3,942,493 (1991 Realignment of $1,385,629 and net County cost of $2,556,864).
During FY 2011-12 State Budget deliberation process, Senate Bill 72 authorized several changes to the CalWORKs program including an 8% grant reduction to all cases; changes in income disregard in determination of grant amounts; and reduction of time-on-aid limits from 60-month to 48-months for adult recipients of aid. These changes have significantly impacted the number of families and adults eligible for CalWORKs assistance as well as the grant aid amount. The CalWORKs caseloads were reduced
DSS - CalWORKs - 6310
from 30,415 families on aid in June of 2010 to 29,117 in December 2011. This resulted in over $22
million in reduced expenditures for FY 2011-12 from FY 2010-11 actual expenditures.
Other Charges
	Recommended funding of $158,104,759 represents a 7% ($11,824,875) decrease from current year based on caseload and average grant projections.
	The overall budgeted CalWORKs caseload reflects a 5% (1,600) decrease from an average of 30,813 cases per month in FY 2011-12 to 29,213 cases per month in FY 2012-13 based on current caseload trends. The decrease in caseload was a result of FY 2011-12 State Budget Actions which reduced the CalWORKs time on aid from 60-month eligibility to a 48-month time limit, reduced the average grant by 8%, and lowered income disregard amounts.
Recommended funding includes:
	CalWORKs program costs in the amount of $158,104,759 to finance a monthly average of 29,213 cases per month at an average grant of $449.
Other Charges
 Recommended funding of $20,664 represents a 62% ($33,876) decrease from current year based on caseload and average grant projections. The budgeted RCA caseload reflects a 60% decrease from 15 cases in FY 2011 -12 to 6 cases in FY 2012-13.
Recommended funding includes:
	$20,664, a decrease of $33,876, to finance a monthly average of six cases at an average grant of
$287 per month.

Significant Program Changes
Assembly Bill (AB) 118 (2011 Realignment) directed counties to create a County Local Revenue Fund in which funds will be deposited to be used exclusively to fund realigned programs as part of the 2011 Realignment including the Foster Care program. Since the implementation of 2011 Realignment, former state share-of-cost of 23% for federally eligible cases and 40% for non-federally eligible cases was transferred to the County to be funded through 2011 Realignment funding streams. Prior to 2011 Realignment, the County mandated share-of-cost for this recommended budget would have been $19,285,688, which is comprised of 1991 Realignment ($11,386,897) and net County cost ($7,898,791) for the FY 2012-13 budget and represents a $2,033,735 (9.54%) decrease from FY 2011-12 adopted County share. However, with implementation of 2011 Realignment, the County’s share-of-cost for Foster Care increased to $28,457,350 which is comprised of 1991 Realignment revenues ($11,386,897), 2011 Realignment revenues ($9,171,662) and net County cost of ($7,898,791).
In recent litigations pertaining to placement rates for Foster Homes (California Foster Parent Association vs. William Lightbourne, et al) and Group Homes (California Alliance of Child and Family Services v. Cliff Allenby, et al), the court ordered the California Department of Social Services (CDSS) to amend the group home rate and foster home rate schedule annually to reflect changes in the California Necessities Index (CNI). In the current year, the group home and foster home rate increase due to CNI was 1.92%. The FY 2012-13 Recommended Budget includes an additional estimated increase of 3.23%, with an estimated cost increase of $770,342.
Language included in 2011 Realignment removed placement cost responsibility for Seriously Emotionally Disturbed (SED) (AB 3632) youth placed by mental health from the Department of Social Services to the Department of Education (CDE). Fiscal Year 2012-13 no longer reflects any costs related to this population.
Assembly Bill 12 authorized several changes which include increasing the child age limit eligibility from 18 years to 19 years beginning January 2012 and from 19 years to 20 years beginning January 2013 for
DSS - Dependent Children - Foster Care -- 6410
both Foster Care and Kin-GAP, which adds two years of eligibility for qualifying children. Prior to the passage of AB 12, the courts could order foster care for a child over 18 and the County would be required to issue 100% County funds for the child. Included in the FY 2012-13 Recommended Budget is a 30% (20) case decrease in “County only” cases based on an estimate of the number of youth who will participate in AB 12.
Participation in AB 12 Extended Foster Care (EFC) is voluntary for the youth, and youth can exit and enter at any time prior to their eligibility expiring; therefore, it is difficult to estimate the true impact. Based on 63% current enrollment of eligible youth effective January 2012, the FY 2012-13 Recommended Budget includes an estimated 106 cases in EFC.
Additionally, AB 12 converted eligible Kin-GAP cases to a Federal Title IV-E program, including programmatic and Title IV-E federal funding regulatory compliance. As of January 2012 all eligible cases had been converted reflecting a 95% Title IVE eligibility within the caseload, which is included in the recommended budget.
Other Charges
Recommended funding of $45,798,192 represents an 11% ($5,627,327) decrease from the current year based on actual caseload and average grant trends.
 The overall budgeted caseload reflects 2,335 average monthly cases in FY 2012-13 based on current year caseload trends, a decrease of 2.65% (64) from the current year projected caseload. The FY 2012-13 budgeted weighted average grant ($1,577) accounts for an estimated 3.23% CNI increase for the foster home and group home rates.
Recommended funding includes:
Federal and state foster care cases budgeted at $40,151,378, a decrease of $4,464,031 from the current year budget, to finance a monthly average of 1,196 minor and 82 Non-Minor Dependent (NMD) federal foster care cases and 435 minor and 24 Non-Minor Dependent (NMD) state foster care cases at an average grant of $1,588 and $2,578 respectively. Recommended funding includes an estimated rate increase to foster home and group home rates of 3.23% based on the state’s estimate of the CNI rate.
Kin-GAP cases budgeted at $3,277,716, a decrease of $819,217 from the current year budget, to finance a monthly average of 394 Title IVE federally eligible cases and 22 non-Title IVE eligible cases at an average grant of $648 and $783 respectively. Recommended funding includes a state-estimated rate increase of 3.23% to eligible cases, projected at 30% of the caseload based on current caseload trends.
Emergency Assistance foster care cases budgeted at $1,847,592, a decrease of $90,074 from the current year budget, to finance an average of 134 cases per-month at an average grant of $1,149 per-month. Recommended funding includes an estimated rate increase to foster home and group home rates of 3.23% based on the state’s estimate of the CNI rate.
Emergency Shelter Care and County Only foster care cases budgeted at $521,506, a decrease of $254,005 from current year budget, to finance an average of 48 cases per-month at an average grant of $913 per-month. Recommended funding includes a State-estimated rate increase of 3.23% to eligible cases, projected at 50% of the caseload based on current caseload trends.


Significant Program Changes
The General Relief program has continued to experience significant growth as a result of the economic downturn. From FY 2008-09 to FY 2010-11, the General Relief caseload increased from 1,648 to 2,766 cases, or an increase of 1,118 cases (68%). Caseload growth has continued through the current year, and is projected to increase to a monthly average of 3,433 in FY 2012-13.
Significant program changes have been implemented since FY 2008-09 to ensure program compliance as well as to address caseload growth including:
	Amending the GR program to adjust the beginning date of aid from the application date to the first day of the month following the date of application, thus limiting employable recipients to three months of aid and eliminating partial month payments.
	Increase number of SSI Advocacy positions that assist GR recipients in attaining SSI funds from one to two positions in FY 2012-13. Upon approval for SSI, GR recipients are discontinued from receiving GR benefits and the County is paid back for GR expenditures from date of SSI application to the date of SSI approval.
	Implementation of Electronic Interim Assistance Reimbursement (elAR) payments, which allowed the County to recover SSI funds more efficiently.
	Implementation of additional job search requirements and processes including more stringent verification processes which ensure employable recipients are actively job searching.
DS-S - General Relief -- 6645
	A reduction of the General Relief maximum grant from $272 to $245, the current legal minimum, effective July 1, 2011.

	CAPI costs in the amount of $1,531,270 to finance a monthly average of 175 CAPI cases at an average grant of $705.
Significant Program Changes
Veterans’ Service Offices throughout California are boosting efforts to strengthen resources offered to veterans in response to the increased number of veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. The Yellow Ribbon Reintegration Program is designed to promote the well-being of National Guard and Reserve members and their families by connecting them with resources throughout the deployment cycle. As part of that effort, the Fresno Veterans Service Officer attends Yellow Ribbon events throughout California as well as various outreach events and health fairs in the Central Valley.
Salaries and Benefits

Significant Program Changes
As a part of the FY 2011-12 state budget, the legislature enacted a series of trailer bills that realigned additional programs between the state and counties. The 2011 Realignment established a new funding structure for a number of 2011 realigned programs and made two significant changes to the structure and funding usage in the 1991 H&WTF.
First, the community mental health programs that were funded with 1991 sales tax and VLF revenues were provided a new funding stream within 2011 Realignment. Statewide community mental health programs will be the first to draw on the 1.0625% sales tax that was established to fund 2011 realignment programs. Mental health programs statewide will receive a total of $1,083 billion, of which Fresno County’s share will be $32,147,436. In addition, mental health programs will retain VLF penalty collection funds ($727,543) that were previously dedicated to these programs through 1991 realignment. In total, Fresno County mental health programs will receive $2,769,838 more in total realignment revenues when compared to the FY 2011-12 Adopted Budget.
Health & Welfare Trust Fund -- 5243
The second change brought on by 2011 Realignment is the establishment of the fourth account within 1991 H&WTF for the new CalWORKs Maintenance-of-Effort (MOE). The sales tax and VLF that was previously received for community mental health programs will instead be deposited into a new CalWORKs MOE subaccount and will fund a portion of CalWORKs assistance payments. CalWORKs assistance payments are reflected in Org 6310 and were previously funded with 97.5% state and federal revenues and 2.5% County share-of-cost that was established in 1991 realignment. The 2.5% County share-of-cost for this program has not changed. 2011 Realignment created an additional county obligation by establishing the MOE that will fund a portion of this program in lieu of State General funds; Fresno County is estimated to receive $28,887,452 for this purpose. By statute, the VLF portion of 1991 Realignment flows through the County General Fund and is reflected as countywide revenues. After 2011 Realignment, the VLF that formerly was deposited for mental health is now commingled with sales tax funds and has become the CalWORKs MOE payment and, as such, will not flow through the County General Fund but will be directly deposited in the H&WTF. As CalWORKs MOE is part of 2011 Realignment and the state labels the entire CalWORKs MOE as sales tax without splitting the deposits between sales tax and VLF, the funds will be deposited directly to Org 5243 as state revenue. Refer to the narrative for Fund 0270 2011 Realignment for more information.
Consumer spending directly affects the amount of realignment revenue received. The significant decline in sales tax that started in FY 2007-08 has stabilized in FY 2009-10 and during the last two fiscal years, the sales tax receipts have slowly increased. The projected budget for sales tax includes caseload growth funding of $3,738,313 that is expected to be paid in September / October of 2012 based on FY 2011-12 actual receipts exceeding FY 2010-11 base by 6%. The projected base for FY 2012-13 would be increased by the same amount ($3,738,313) resulting in a recommended increase for sales tax of $7,476,626 compared to current year.
Based on statutes, in the years that sales tax receipts exceed prior year base, the funds will be first utilized to fund earned caseload growth within the Social Services account. Fresno County is owed $6,516,902 in caseload growth that was earned in FY 2007-08, FY 2008-09, and FY 2009-10. $3,738,313 of this amount is expected to be paid during FY 12-13 and is included in the recommended budget.
Vehicle License Fee collections have continued to decline in FY 2011-12 and are expected to be 6% below FY 2010-11 base. The recommended budget for FY 2012-13 assumes that vehicle license fee revenues will stabilize and that the base will not be eroded beyond the 6% loss reached in current year.

Salaries and Benefits
	Salaries and Benefits, recommended at $262,428 represents a 13% ($40,360) decrease from the current year primarily due to the recommended elimination of the Office Assistant position which is partially offset by increases in the Workers’ Compensation and Retirement rates. Staffing is recommended at a decrease of one position from the current year level.

Significant Program Changes
With the removal of Fresno County from European Grape Vine Moth (EGVM) quarantine, the contracts for regulatory trapping and quarantine enforcement are no longer funded resulting in a $90,710 revenue reduction.
A realignment of Fruit and Vegetable Standardization funding to accommodate counties that did not have an active program previously resulted in a $39,320 or 15% reduction in revenues.
Due to the fact that growers now have the enhanced ability to enter pesticide use reports for themselves online or through a third party vendor by using the CalAgPermits System, the pesticide use reporting data entry agreement will be reduced by 25% or $27,947 as agreed upon by the Commissioners’ Association and the California Department of Pesticide Regulations.
Minimal permanent employees were shifted away from other duties to work these programs with the majority of expenditures in the Extra-Help (Account 6200) and County Garage, Transportation (Account 7416). The reductions in revenues and appropriations were factored into the budget.

Significant Program Changes
Printing for our grant-funded programs will be outsourced for FY 2012-13 to allow our County staff to direct their efforts to new and ongoing projects. Operating the department with three County staff has been challenging, especially when any one County staff member is on planned leave or out ill. Our 3 County staff serves 44 UC staff in addition to serving the residents of Fresno County and performing basic day-to-day tasks required to keep the office operating efficiently. State budget reductions have also impacted the University’s budget. As a result, the permanent County Director position was split between two academics with full-time programs as the University works through reorganization. The interim arrangement continues to keep our County staff busy with projects that help support the CoCounty Directors.
The University remains committed to the residents of Fresno County. As retirements in the UC Cooperative Extension system take place, academic positions are being prioritized and replaced in the County. As such, the department is in the process of hiring a new academic whose program focus will be on nut crops. This position has been vacant in Fresno County for three years. The department expects this individual to begin working by August 2012. This staffing addition increases the need for County-funded services (e.g. support staff time, phone, vehicle, etc.).
Approximately 30% of this budget is funded by the Cooperative Extension Research Trust Fund. The NCC allocation of $294,796 provides funding for Salaries and Benefits for three FTEs ($248,734) and approximately 25% ($46,062) of the services and supply budget. This requires that 75% ($138,776) of the service and supply budget be funded by other sources.
Salaries and Benefits
Salaries and Benefits recommended at $248,734 represent a 3% increase ($7,299) over the current year. Staffing is recommended at the current year level of three positions.
Recommended funding includes:
Adjustments in salaries for all staff based on recommended and negotiated salary reductions instituted in FY 2011-12.
A 3% ($4,691) increase in Regular Salaries based on the difference between budget instructions and actual amounts.
A 3% ($2,405) increase in Retirement Contribution based on rates provided.
Services and Supplies
Services and Supplies reflect a 14% decrease ($30,543) primarily as a result of decreases in Liability Insurance and Utility rates.
Recommended funding includes:
A 79% ($31,793) decrease in Liability Insurance rates.
An 84% ($1,319) increase in PropertyA/ehicle Damage Insurance rates.
Significant Program Changes
Due to current staffing levels, the Development Services Division will continue to maintain reduced public counter hours with closure one-half day every Friday. In addition, due to funding constraints, Code Enforcement efforts will exclusively be focused on health and safety code related violations. Neighborhood Beautification and land use violations (inappropriate use/activities per Zoning/Williamson Act) would be given secondary priority.

Significant Program Changes
Some of the decrease in appropriations is reflective of the completion of contracts on several large multiyear projects for several phases of Academy Avenue, several Highway Bridge Replacements such as
PW&P - Road Fund - 4510
the Kings River Bridge on Goodfellow, Byrd Slough on Goodfellow, the Friant-Kern Canal Bridge Rail Replacement on Piedra Road, and one-time ARRA appropriations for asphalt concrete overlays and the Kearney Blvd. Palm Tree Replacement project. However, much of the overall budget still reflects an allocation of funds for specific Measure “C” and Federal Aid projects that will be awarded for construction or have significant design engineering completed in the coming fiscal year.
The proposed budget includes funding from the “Transportation Funding Swap” in lieu of Proposition 42 funds. The risk associated with the Transportation Funding Swap, in contrast to Proposition 42, is that the State has the ability to borrow the revenue, as well as fluctuations in revenue due to the instability of fuel consumption.
The allocation of funding considers the uncertainty of Federal Funding such as Stimulus (ARRA) funding and the lack of adoption of a new Federal Surface Transportation Bill to replace SAFETEA-LU and current unstable prices of oil products, such as asphalt concrete and liquid asphalts, and aggregate materials used in road maintenance and new construction.
Staffing is recommended at 220 positions, a reduction of 2 positions from the current year.
The department continues its team-based approach in seeking to identify avenues for improving service to our clients and other County departments. This includes working with other jurisdictions on projects of common interest. The use of advanced electronic and computer technology in areas such as Geographic Information Systems (GIS), and Cost Accounting Management System (CAMS) are being employed.
Total $ 23.47 Million
	A total of $5.68 million is recommended for day labor rehabilitation and specific maintenance projects for roads. These funds will be expended for the rehabilitation of approximately 18 miles of selected lower traffic volume roads by day labor forces. Approximately $250,000 (not included in the $5.68 million allocation) has been budgeted for maintenance of private roads in the County Service Areas (CSAs). The CSAs will reimburse the Road Fund for all maintenance work.
	The recommended $6.94 million for contract preventive maintenance projects will provide for the maintenance treatment of approximately 30 miles of slurry seals on residential streets, 60 miles of chip seal projects, and 10 miles of asphalt concrete overlay. The preventive maintenance allocation also reflects $2.06 million of CMAQ Shoulder projects throughout the County.
	Pothole patching, shoulder maintenance, and other routine road maintenance activities, including culvert maintenance, storm damage repairs, tree trimming, and snow removal are recommended at $8.03 million. The allocation of expenditure activity to the various general maintenance categories can vary in any given year. For example, in years when above average precipitation occurs, the cost for snow removal, storm response and signing, and storm damage repairs will consume more of these allocations than in normal years. 
PW&P - Road Fund - 4510
	Traffic signs and striping, including installation and maintenance of traffic signs, pavement markings, and line striping is recommended at $1.28 million. This allocation includes funding for agreements with Caltrans for Caltrans operated traffic signals at joint State/County intersections at an annual cost of approximately $50,000 and the City of Fresno for the maintenance of County-owned traffic signals and lighting at an annual cost of approximately $140,000 and with a private contractor in the annual amount of $10,000 to maintain a traffic signal and lighting installed by the State on Jayne Avenue in the Coalinga area as a condition of development for the State Hospital facility (traffic volumes entering and leaving the facility warranted a traffic signal on Jayne Avenue and since Jayne Avenue is a County road, the signal became the property of the County).
	Included in the $23.47 million allocation in the proposed budget for road maintenance and traffic signs and striping, there is an allocation of $1.54 million for traffic safety and operations activities. This allocation provides for the preparation and review of Traffic Safety Studies to determine the need for four-way stop signs, other traffic control devices, traffic control needs, review and approval of encroachment permits for work to be done within the County road right-of-way, issuance of oversize load permits for County roads, and various other operational and safety roadway related activities. This allocation also includes the Traffic Census (traffic count program) section in the Maintenance and Operations Division.

Over the last three years the administration of Parks, including grant administration, has primarily been accomplished by staff after hours and on weekends as the Parks budget did not contain sufficient funding for those activities.
The decrease in field staff hours over the past three years continues to result in significant reductions in service levels to all County parks and ground areas, including seasonal closures (October - February) of parks such as Los Gatos, Skaggs, and Laton. The reduced service level is visible in the decline of turf, tree and shrub maintenance, facilities (restroom cleanliness and supplies), graffiti abatement and litter removal. Staffing at areas such as Courthouse Park, Lost Lake, Veteran’s Cemetery and Kearney will continue at the reduced rate of two or three days per-week.
Salaries and Benefits

Significant Program Changes
The Library’s restructure plan was implemented in June 2011 with little change to customer services. The restructure allowed staff to take on new assignments, providing long overdue opportunities for growth and development. It also allowed the Library to rebalance workloads and reduce positions to reduce the disparity between revenues and expenditures. New programs and services were introduced including E-books; the bestseller browsing collection: New and Now; and the introduction of WiFi connectivity at several branches. Library hours were reduced at the Central Library after a careful review of activity showed that the facility was not being accessed in the evening hours. This also resulted in some staff savings.
The new Tranquillity Library, funded by the Measure B process and a State Library Construction Bond Act grant was opened in July 2011. The 3,484 square-foot library is an icon in the community and is heavily used. The Central Library is also undergoing minor renovations with the relocation of all computers to the first floor, new paint, and new service desks. The changes have increased visits to the facility and customers have indicated their approval of the upgrades. More renovations will occur as funding permits including new furniture, carpeting, and a display area to feature materials from the William Saroyan Collection.
In January 2012 the state enacted budget triggers which eliminated all funding to libraries. Fresno County Public Library was affected by losing $307,896 in California Public Library Fund funding and $61,7 41 in California Library Literacy Service funding. Also, there is a potential of an estimated increase in the membership fee to the San Joaquin Valley Library System of $353,602 due to the loss to the San Joaquin Valley Library System of $1,125,225 in State Transaction Reimbursement Revenues and $180,976 in California Library Services Act funding. On the positive, Measure B sales tax revenues and property tax revenues have started to recover, allowing the Library to continue to reduce the disparities between revenues and expenditures.
Measure B, the sales tax that comprises approximately 53% of the Library’s revenue is currently set to expire on March 31, 2013. Priorities this year will include a public awareness campaign about the library to educate the community about the programs and services provided by the Library. The Library is serving as an information source for the Measure B Citizens for Libraries and Literacy Committee who are engaged in renewing the tax measure. Voters will be asked to renew this tax in the November 2012 election. Should the measure not pass at the polls, the library system will be forced to reduce operations by 53% which will include the closure of facilities, the elimination of programs and services, and the layoff of staff.
