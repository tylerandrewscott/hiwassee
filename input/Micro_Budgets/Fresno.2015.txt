Significant Program Changes
On January 5, 2015, the Sheriff became the Sheriff-Coroner and transferred in nine positions of that
unit to continue providing Coroner services for the residents of Fresno County. The Coroner unit also
includes one Sheriff’s Lieutenant position approved by the Board of Supervisors as part of the FY 2014-
15 Adopted Budget, to oversee the consolidation and administration of the Coroner’s operations with
the Sheriff’s Office. The recommended budget includes full-year funding for all ten positions and
associated services and supplies.
On April 14, 2014, the California Commission on Peace Officer Standards and Training (POST)
completed a management study of the Fresno County Sheriff’s Office. The study indicated that “This
agency is in need of reorganization and increases in management staffing in order to bring the agency
into a more sustainable law enforcement best practice profile.” The recommended budget includes the
addition of five law enforcement management positions to address this recommendation as outlined
below.
 One Assistant Sheriff position with executive responsibility over the current patrol bureau and the
reinstatement of the Law Enforcement Operations Support Bureau (these functions are currently
overseen by the Undersheriff and Assistant Sheriff for Jail Operations). Total staff in this chain of
command will be 543;
 One Sheriff’s Captain position with executive responsibility for the Operations Support Bureau
(currently overseen by the Assistant Sheriff for Jail Operations) with 200 total staff;
 One Sheriff’s Lieutenant position reporting to the Operations Support Bureau Captain to directly
oversee the Internal Affairs unit (this function is currently overseen by the Human Resources
Lieutenant);
 One Sheriff’s Lieutenant position to assume management responsibility for the Civil and Records
units that were consolidated with the duties of the Detective Lieutenant during the recession; and
 One Sheriff’s Lieutenant position to assume responsibility for Patrol Area 4 that was consolidated
with the duties of the Patrol Area 2 Lieutenant during the recession.
On September 30, 2014, Anti-Drug Abuse (ADA) program grant funding for three Deputy Sheriff
positions was eliminated. Effective June 30, 2015, Marijuana Suppression program grant funding for
one Deputy Sheriff position will also be eliminated. An additional three Deputy Sheriff positions will not
be funded effective July 1, 2015 due to the discontinuation of funding from the State Indian Gaming
allocation. The Sheriff-Coroner recommends these seven Deputy Sheriff positions be funded within the
department’s net County cost allocation thereby preventing service reductions associated with this
classification. The three deputies assigned to the Indian Gaming program will be re-assigned to net
County cost (NCC) functions (e.g., patrol). Initially, the four deputies performing ADA and marijuana
suppression functions will remain in those assignments based on need, but may be re-assigned to other
net County cost functions (e.g., patrol) as needed.
The County is concluding settlement negotiations related to the Quentin Hall lawsuit. As a result of
negotiations, pending Board approval, the Sheriff-Coroner will add 136 positions over a three-year
period. The recommended budget includes the first year of staffing related to the settlement (49
Correctional Officers and 2 Correctional Sergeants) effective July 20, 2015 along with Overtime funding
for 20 positions for the first two weeks of the fiscal year to begin to implement Quentin Hall settlement
recommendations pending the hiring of the additional correctional staff. The recommended budget also
includes the addition of one Correctional Lieutenant position to oversee the implementation of the
Quentin Hall settlement requirements.

Significant Program Changes
On January 5, 2015, the District Attorney became the District Attorney-Public Administrator and
transferred in four staff members of that unit to continue providing Public Administrator services for the
residents of Fresno County.
On November 4, 2014, the voters of the State of California approved Prop 47 that has impacted the
Fresno County District Attorney’s Office by increasing (by the thousands) the number of applications and
petitions for charge reductions. This new task has required the full-time assignment of a Deputy District
Attorney position and multiple support staff. Furthermore, the large number of released offenders are
returning to their communities and committing more crimes driving the number of new cases up and
impacting the workload of law enforcement and the District Attorney.
On March 16, 2015, the Community Corrections Partnership approved a request from the District
Attorney and Public Defender to fund positions related to reducing the impact of Prop 47 on the criminal
justice system. The proposal was approved by the Board of Supervisors at the April 21, 2015 meeting,
adding one Deputy District Attorney, one Paralegal, and one Office Assistant positions to reduce the
caseload created by the passage of Prop 47.
Salaries and Benefits
 Salaries and Benefits, recommended at $25,893,910, represent a 5% ($1,191,325) increase over the
current year adopted budget primarily due to full-year funding for the Public Administrator and Prop
47 positions, the addition of one Division Manager position, and negotiated salary adjustments.
Recommended funding includes:
 Full-year funding for 191 authorized positions.
 The addition of one Division Manager position to assist District Attorney management staff with
planning, developing, communicating and evaluating administrative support activities, goals,
programs, policies, and procedures for the District Attorney’s Office. This position will also be
responsible for the management and oversight of administrative and personnel services. Once
the Division Manager position is filled, the department’s Senior Staff Analyst position will be filled
at the Staff Analyst III level and the Senior Staff Analyst classification will be deleted from Org
2860.
 The reclassification of one vacant Supervising Office Assistant I position to a Supervising Office
Assistant II position to provide the department with more supervision flexibility. This action does
not increase the total number of authorized positions.

funding for the Public Administrator and Prop 47 positions, the addition of one Division

due to the elimination of an annual maintenance fee for the new CMS system, pending
completion of the RFP process.
 Account 7296 Data Processing Services represent a 6% ($56,969) increase due to
reclassification of Account 7040, Telephone Charges to this account, partially offset with the

Significant Program Changes
This budget reflects significant changes in both delivery of care and funding for the MISP. In previous
years, all MISP services were contracted with Community Regional Medical Centers (CRMC). Due to a
shift in patients from MISP to Medi-Cal and significantly reduced Health Realignment revenues under AB
85, the Board directed staff to provide CRMC a notice of termination of the Master Agreement for
Indigent and Inmate Medical Care effective December 1, 2014. Additionally the Board made revisions to
the MISP eligibility criteria and scope of services, to reflect the changes brought forward by the ACA.
Effective December 1, 2014, the County entered into agreements with CRMC and Central California
Faculty Medical Group (CCFMG) to provide the MISP. Additionally the Board entered into an agreement
with Advantek for the reimbursement for the provision of certain non-emergency specialty medical
services for residents who do not qualify for MISP or participation in the ACA. This budget includes
appropriations for claim reimbursement contracts with CRMC and Central California Faculty Medical
Group (CCFMG) for MISP, and Advantek for the reimbursement for the provision of certain nonemergency
specialty medical services. Inmate medical care previously provided in the contracted
services with CRMC, is included through a provider contract budgeted in Org 5620 – Public Health.
Services and Supplies
 Services and Supplies, recommended at $7,444,392, represent a 30% ($3,186,097) decrease from
the current year adopted budget primarily due to an accounting shift of contract providers for indigent
healthcare and in-custody healthcare from this Org to Public Health Org - 5620.
Recommended funding includes:
 Account 7295, Professional and Specialized Services, represent a 30% ($3,186,097) decrease
from the current year due to indigent healthcare provided through claim reimbursement contracts
with CRMC, CCFMG, and Advantek, and in-custody healthcare included in the recommended
budget for 5620 – Public Health. Funding for the MISP is recommended at $1,875,000. Funding
for the reimbursement for the provision of certain non-emergency specialty medical services is
recommended at $5,569,392.
Other Financing Uses
 Other Financing Uses, recommended at $60,288,792, represent a 26% ($12,443,258) increase over
current year adopted budget due to an increase in estimated VLF Realignment revenues.
Recommended funding includes:
 Account 7910, Operating Transfer Out, represents a 26% ($12,443,258) increase over current
year due to an increase in estimate VLF Realignment revenues, which must pass through this
Org.
 This account includes the mandated County local match ($11,359,752) to qualify Fresno County
for Local Health and Welfare Realignment sales tax revenue, which consists of $10,404,113 for
the Health Account and $955,639 for the Mental Health Account. This is the County’s fixed MOE
requirement that is specified in Welfare and Institutions Code §17608.010. This requirement is a
condition for the deposit of sales tax into the County’s Local Health and Welfare Trust Fund
account.
 By meeting the MOE, the County is eligible to receive ($48,929,040) in VLF Realignment
revenues, for specific purposes, which consists of Health VLF revenues ($24,522,534), Mental
Health VLF ($331,262), Social Services VLF ($1,722,570), and Family Support VLF revenues
($2,974,820); VLF Collection Account revenues ($727,543); and CalWORKs MOE revenues
($18,650,311). These funds are appropriated in this budget and transferred to the H&WTF
Budget (Org 5243).


Significant Program Changes
The budget continues to include a variety of significant fiscal effects related to Patient Protection and
Affordable Care Act (ACA) implementation. Changes related to ACA have resulted in both costs and
savings. The ACA resulted in new eligibility and entitlements beginning January 1, 2014. The ACA
includes expanded Medi-Cal coverage to adults solely based on an income under 138% of the Federal
Poverty level. The ACA also includes enhanced mental health and substance use disorder services for
both newly eligible and previously eligible Medi-Cal beneficiaries. As a result, many indigent adults
receiving care became eligible for Medi-Cal, shifting the cost of services from Mental Health Realignment
to Federal reimbursement.
A 10% ($3,464,765) transfer of 1991 Realignment revenue in the Health and Welfare Trust Fund from
Mental Health to the Health account was approved by the Board on May 5, 2015, due to reductions in
Health Realignment revenue. This continues the 10% shift approved for FY 2014-15 with the Board
making the determination that it was the most cost effective use of available resources to maximize client
outcomes. The department has identified Mental Health Realignment savings made available by
enhanced Federal revenues through ACA implementation, which shifted a portion of the indigent
population previously being served to Medi-Cal eligibility effective January 1, 2014. The Mental Health
Realignment savings has resulted in the department taking a larger role in the Jail and Juvenile Justice
Campus Psychiatric services by increasing the department’s share of the Corizon contract by $1.5
million; allowing for the renovation of the former administration building ($700,000); updating the
department fleet ($708,750); and resurfacing of the parking lots along Kings Canyon Avenue ($320,000).
The “Katie A.” class action lawsuit against the State of California was settled on December 1, 2011,
which required counties to provide an integrated service delivery model with the Department of Social
Services-Child Welfare (DSS-CW) to ensure children and families in the child welfare system are
screened, referred and receive mental health treatment services. The department provided Mental
Health Services Act (MHSA) funding allocated for the Team Decision Making program and 2011
Behavioral Health Realignment to add eight clinical and support positions in FY 2013-14, that are colocated
at DSS coordinating mental health systems and community stakeholder presentations and input.
The departments collaborated on a competitive bid process to select vendors to align mental health
services with the requirements of Katie A. and in alignment with the California Partners for Permanency
program model. Services began during FY 2014-15.
In January 2014, the department submitted a Senate Bill (SB) 82: Investment in Mental Health Wellness
Act of 2013 grant application to create an expanded crisis response system for the Fresno County
Recovery Center. On July 15, 2014, the department received a preliminary award of $794,795 for an
eight-bed expansion of the Exodus Adult Crisis Stabilization unit (CSU) and creation of an eight-bed
Youth CSU at the Kings Canyon Campus. Construction will be complete and services will begin during
FY 2014-15. On December 9, 2014, the department also received final award approval of $3.1 million for
the Adult Crisis Residential Treatment facility to be built at the Kings Canyon Campus. Construction of
that facility is scheduled to begin during FY 2015-16 and is anticipated to be completed by early FY
2016-17.
Salaries and Benefits
 Salaries and Benefits, recommended at $53,509,738, represent an 8% ($3,932,267) increase over
the FY 2014-15 Adopted Budget primarily due to salary adjustments and step increases, an increase
in Extra-Help appropriations based on actual usage, an increase in the physician salary to a more
competitive level, an increase in retirement contributions and the net increase of seven positions over
the FY 2014-15 Adopted Budget. The ten positions recommended for addition include seven Clinical
Supervisor positions to improve program supervision and provider support, as staff increases the
frequency of site visits to contracted providers and clients, two Substance Abuse Specialist positions
for program monitoring of Substance Use Disorder contracted providers, as required by the State and
one Accountant position to provide more direct monitoring of revenue reimbursement for services,
and track changing health regulations related to outcomes and reporting. These increases are
partially offset by the midyear elimination of three Mental Health Worker positions, as a result of the
establishment of the Youth CSU and elimination of the Children’s Crisis Assessment Intervention
Resolution Center. Staffing is recommended at 549 positions, an increase of 10 positions over the
current year.
Recommended funding includes the following changes to the FY 2014-15 Adopted Budget:
 Account 6100, Regular Salaries, represent a 7% ($1,813,455) increase over the current year
primarily due to salary adjustments and step increases, an increase in physician salary pay and a
net increase of seven positions over the FY 2014-15 Adopted Budget.
 Account 6200, Extra-Help represents a 48% ($324,237) increase over the current year based on

$1,020,000 in FY 2015-16, and an increase in the training budget of $571,316. The department has
also budgeted for the replacement of copiers, monitors, printers and chairs totaling $206,982 as part
of the department’s Five-Year Capital and Minor Equipment Replacement Plan.
Recommended funding includes the following changes to the FY 2014-15 Adopted Budget:
 Accounts 7223 Managed Care, 7294 Professional and Specialized Services-Contracts and 7295
Professional and Specialized Services are the basis for most of the Services and Supplies costs
for the department. Those are primarily for Substance Use Disorder Prevention and Treatment
services and Mental Health Treatment services. The reduction of $1,311,887, among the three
accounts, is primarily due to a reduction in contract costs related to Jail Psychiatric and Juvenile
Justice Campus Psychiatric services which are paid through the Department of Public Health
using Mental Health Realignment ($3,318,319). Funding to support the Mental Health cost of the
contract will come directly from the Health Org 52430301 of the Health and Welfare Trust Fund.
 Account 7296, Data Processing Services, represent a 47% ($914,136) increase over current
year, which is primarily due to Avatar Electronic Health Records and billing system upgrades
scheduled for FY 2015-16 and the shift of Telephone Charges ($249,422) from Account 7040 to
this line item.
 Account 7345, Facility Services–Rent, represent a 109% ($1,161,560) increase over current year
based on an estimate from Internal Services Department, as well as an additional $700,000 for
the renovation of the former administration building on the Kings Canyon Campus for waiting
room upgrades and reconfiguration, carpet replacement, painting and capacity expansion for the
Adult Mental Health Clinical Outpatient Team, the Medical Team, Urgent Care Wellness Center
and the Law Enforcement Team. Until the middle of FY 2014-15, much of the building was
dedicated to administration and administrative support and the remodeling will allow for the
transition to service delivery. Also included is $320,000 for a parking lot resurfacing project for
the adjacent lots along Kings Canyon Road to create safer conditions for staff, clients and on-site
provider’s staff.
 Account 7385, Small Tools and Instruments, represent a 982% ($250,494) increase over the
current year primarily to replace older equipment including chairs, monitors, printers and copiers.

needs in FY 2015-16 and in future years.

Salaries and Benefits
 Salaries and Benefits, recommended at $195,820,945, represent a 4% ($6,980,120) increase over
the current year adopted budget primarily due to the full-year cost of 43 IHSS positions that were
added in February 2015 and 27 CWS and CalWORKs positions that were added in April 2015. The
increase also includes updated Retirement Contribution rates and projected OASDI, Workers’
Compensation, and Health Insurance costs for the budget year. Staffing is recommended at 2,527
positions, the same as the current level.
Recommended funding includes:
 Account 6100, Regular Salaries, represent a 3% ($2,665,318) increase over FY 2014-15
Adopted Budget due to the full-year cost of 70 additional positions (43 IHSS and 27 CWS and
CalWORKs) that were added in the current year. In addition, the recommended budget includes
the deletion of one vacant Principal Analyst position and the addition of one (1) Social Services
Program Manager position in order to better align departmental personnel functions with County
personnel rules and regulations.
 Account 6200, Extra-Help, represents a significant ($1,488,041) increase over the current year
based on the department’s plan to reduce the vacancy rate in its most critical service delivery
positions. The recommended extra-help appropriations will be utilized to form a training pool of
eligibility and social workers hired from regular employment lists. The extra-help staff will attend
classroom training while receiving on the job experience by assisting eligibility and social worker
program units to manage work of staff on leave of absences. As vacancies occur, they will be
filled through the training pool, thereby decreasing the time a position remains vacant. The
department will assure that all personnel guidelines are observed in the use of extra-help staffing.
 Account 6350, Unemployment Insurance, represents a 69% ($68,575) decrease from the current
year based on the actual department claim calculation provided by Risk Management.
 Account 6400, Retirement Contribution, represents a 3% ($1,724,990) increase over the current
year based on the updated Retirement Contribution rates and the full-year retirement benefit
costs for 70 additional positions that were added in the current year.
 Account 6500, OASDI, reflects a 4% ($318,191) increase based on full-year costs for the addition
of 70 positions in the current year.
 Account 6550, Workers’ Compensation Contribution, reflects an 18% ($578,663) increase over
the current year based on actual experience and rates provided by Risk Management.
 Account 6600, Health Insurance Contribution, represents a 2% ($290,530) increase over the
current year due to the projected full-year costs of health insurance elections of 70 addition
positions that were added in the current year and updated information on dependent and family
care elections for FY 2015-16.
 Vacancy Rate Discount is recommended at 6.5% ($7,098,404) to account for normal recruitment
timeframes, unpaid leave of absences, and savings associated with employee turnover. The
Vacancy Rate Discount reflects a decrease from the current year due to the anticipated impacts
of the department’s plan to reduce the vacancy rate for its high-turnover positions.
Services and Supplies
 Services and Supplies, recommended at $67,203,674, represent a 14% ($8,157,174) increase over
the current year adopted budget primarily due to the cost of the court-ordered children’s mental
health service agreements. The estimated cost of the court-ordered children’s mental health service
agreements in the recommended budget reflect the estimated on-going cost of providing services.
Recommended funding includes:
 Account 7040, Telephone Charges, reflect a 100% ($1,230,251) decrease from the current year
adopted budget. The evolution in technology has allowed for phone connectivity to follow data
processing connections which allows access to phone messages via email a Countywide
telephone directory and the ability of consumers to check case status via phone. Because
additional information access through phone lines is made possible through a direct connection
to computer servers, telephone charges will be included as part of Account 7296 Data
Processing Services.
 Account 7223, Managed Care Providers, reflect a 154% ($5,700,000) increase over the current
year adopted budget due to appropriations for the court-ordered children’s mental health
agreements.
 Account 7295, Professional & Specialized Services, reflect a 12% ($1,460,380) increase over the
current year adopted budget based on projected increases in interdepartmental charges from
various departments, which include charges from County Counsel for projected support of child
welfare functions, charges from the Veterans’ Services Office for Medi-Cal application services,
and direct client services from various County departments.
Other Charges
 Other Charges, recommended at $49,843,050, represent a 16% ($6,732,380) increase over the
current year adopted budget based on projected costs of direct client support and services.
Recommended funding includes:
 An increased cost ($1,689,675) for childcare assistance provided to CalWORKs participants
engaging in employment activities. These include payments made directly to childcare providers
for the direct benefit of consumer participation in employment activities.
 An increased cost ($2,213,404) for transportation assistance provided to CalWORKs participants
engaging in employment activities. These include payments made directly to consumers for gas
and/or public transit passes.
 An increased cost ($801,732) for human trafficking and domestic violence victims assistance
services (provided through a contractor).
 An increased cost ($1,255,942) to reflect the full-year cost of the CalWORKs Housing Support
and CalWORKs Family Stabilization agreements, which were approved midyear FY 2014-15.
Other Financing Uses
 Operating Transfers Out, recommended at $985,100, represent costs to replace 17 vehicles that
have reached their useful life and are recommended by the Internal Services Department for
replacement. These vehicles replace those in the department’s current fleet. In addition, 25 vehicles
are requested to be added to the department’s fleet in order to meet the current mandated work of
the CWS and IHSS programs. The department manages its fleet based on an ongoing analysis of
need and vehicle usage. There are not sufficient vehicles to meet the current workload, which has
resulted in wait times for CWS and IHSS staff performing mandated contacts, canceled home
visitations and appointments with providers and dependent children, increased personal vehicle use,
which creates potential issues as mandated contacts can result in the need to transport children, and
delayed processing of IHSS assessments.

Other Charges
 Recommended funding of $32,444,490 represents a 6% ($1,801,485) increase over the current year
adopted budget based on current year caseloads and average grant projections. The average
caseload includes 21 cases currently participating in the SB 163 Wraparound program in lieu of
group home placements. Adoption Assistance uses State foster home rates and State approved
group home rates; therefore, changes to those rates due to the California Necessities Index (CNI)
rate affect the average grant payments.
 The Aid to Adoptions recommended budget compared to FY 2014-15 Adopted Budget caseload
reflects a 5% (126) caseload growth over the current year projected cases of 2,677 per month to
2,803 cases per month in FY 2015-16, based on current caseload trends. The recommended budget
also includes the estimated impact of the 2.17% California Necessities Index (CNI) increase to the
average grant, which accounts for $679,862 in increased cost for FY 2015-16.
Recommended funding includes:
 Federal Aid to Adoptions cases budgeted at $28,345,359 represent an increase of $1,926,524 for
a monthly average of 2,448 cases at a rounded average grant of $991.
 Non-Federal Aid to Adoptions cases budgeted at $4,081,380 represent an increase of $314,562
for a monthly average of 356 cases at a rounded average grant of $956.
 Estimated grant repayments are appropriated in the amount of $17,750. These costs are
incurred by the department; therefore, funds are budgeted in the recommended appropriations
but are reduced from the total cost claimed under Federal and Non-Federal Aid to Adoptions
cases.


Significant Program Changes
Senate Bill 855 (SB 855) set a 5% increase to the Maximum Aid Payment (MAP) effective April 1, 2015,
for all CalWORKs cases, increasing the average monthly grant from $478 to $504. The estimated
annual increase in assistance payments for Fresno County is $8,848,845 and will be fully-funded by the
State. There will be no additional County share-of-cost as a result of this grant increase.
On April 1, 2015, Assembly Bill 1468 (AB 1468) made individuals convicted of any offense classified as a
felony that has an element of possession, use, or distribution of a controlled substance eligible to receive
CalWORKs and/or CalFresh benefits. As a condition of eligibility to receive CalWORKs or CalFresh
benefits, an applicant or recipient who is on probation or parole shall comply with the terms of probation
or parole, including participation in a government-recognized drug treatment program, if required. If the
department receives verification that the individual is in violation of probation or parole or that the
individual is a fleeing felon pursuant to Federal law, the individual shall be ineligible for CalWORKs or
CalFresh benefits until the person is no longer in violation of probation or parole or a fleeing felon.
Other Charges

 The FY 2015-16 Recommended Budget CalWORKs caseload reflects a 1% (257 cases)
decrease from a monthly average of 29,120 cases in FY 2014-15 to a monthly average of 28,863
cases in FY 2015-16 based on current caseload trends. An average grant of $504 per month is
projected for the budget year.


Other Charges
 Recommended Budget of $25,860 reflects a 28% ($10,140) decrease from the current year based on
caseload and average grant projections. The budgeted RCA caseload reflects a 30% decrease from
ten cases in FY 2014-15 to seven cases in FY 2015-16.
Recommended funding includes:
 $25,860, which is a decrease of ($10,140) to finance a monthly average of seven cases per
month with an average grant of $280.


Significant Program Changes
On December 16, 2014, the Board of Supervisors approved and authorized an Agreement with Aspiranet
to provide Transitional Housing Program Plus, Transitional Housing Program Plus Foster Care, and
Family Unification Program Case Management services effective January 1, 2015 through December 31,
2017. Transitional Housing Program Plus (THP Plus) is a transitional housing program for former
foster/probation youth, ages 18-24. The program goal is to provide a safe living environment while
helping youth develop skills for successful independent living. Services are provided to participants for a
maximum of 24 months and include educational guidance, employment counseling and community
referrals. Transitional Housing Program Plus Foster Care (THP+FC) is similar to THP Plus; however,
this program targets dependent youth ages 18-21 that are in foster care. Services provided through
THP+FC are covered by State Foster Care rates. THP Plus will assist 18 former foster care/probation
youth per year and THP+FC will assist 40 foster care youth per year. The maximum annual cost for this
agreement is funded with 2011 Realignment funds and SB 163 Children’s Wraparound Program Funds.

increase of 1% (35 cases) over the current year caseload. The FY 2015-16 budgeted average
placement cost of $1,630 per month includes a statutory increase to foster home and group
home rates based on a California Necessities Index (CNI) estimate of 2.17% as estimated in the
Governors May 2014 Revised budget. This rate increase was set in statute due to the California
State Foster Parent Association v. William Lightbourne court settlement.
Recommended funding includes:
 Federal and State foster care cases budgeted at $45,766,578, an increase of $2,880,953 over
current year based on a monthly average of 1,740 minor (0-18 years old) cases at an average
grant of $1,938 and 269 EFC (19-21 years old) cases at an average grant of $1,637.

total cost claimed under the State CAPI program.


Significant Program Changes
The VSO is in the process of securing larger office space located adjacent to the State of California
Veterans Office. The VSO currently serves an average of 500 veterans per month, and the current
location is no longer sufficient to handle the increased number of veterans seeking access to services.
The proposed location’s larger size will provide the space needed for the increased volume, and the
proximity to the State office will allow veterans to receive State and County services at one location,
thereby making it easier for veterans with disabilities to gain access to services.
Salaries and Benefits
 Salaries and Benefits, recommended at $513,094, represent a 9% ($41,230) increase over FY
2014-15 Adopted Budget due to promotions, salary step increases, associated benefit increases, as
well as budgeted extra-help. Staffing is recommended at the current level of six positions.

Significant Program Changes
Effective July 1, 2012, the State implemented a Maintenance-of-Effort (MOE) for the IHSS Program.
Prior to the IHSS MOE, the County share-of-cost for IHSS was determined through statutory sharing
ratios and the County was responsible for approximately 17.6% of the total cost of the IHSS program.
Under the MOE, the County share-of-cost became a set amount that was equal to the actual County
share-of-cost incurred by each County for FY 2011-12. The County must pay that set amount regardless
of the actual IHSS program expenditures. Through the IHSS MOE, the County will not be financially
impacted by any caseload increases; however, the County will also not realize any financial savings
resulting from caseload decreases. Based on current statute, the IHSS MOE can be increased by the
State for the following reasons: 1) County negotiated wage and/or benefits increases; and 2) an annual
inflation factor of 3.5% effective July 1 of each fiscal year with the exception of years where there is
‘negative growth’ in 1991 Realignment funds. Based on this statute, a $953,982 increase in the MOE will
be in effect July 1, 2015 and is included in the recommended budget.
In March 2013, the State, IHSS beneficiaries and labor organizations reached a settlement resolving
major legal actions against State imposed reductions to the IHSS Program. Under the terms of the
settlement, the State reduced authorized hours by 8% in FY 2013-14 and then restored 1% of the
reduction in hours beginning on July 1, 2014, reducing the total hour reduction from 8% to 7% for FY
2014-15 and forward. For FY 2015-16 the State is, per the settlement, evaluating the ability to remove
the 7% reduction. The January 2015 Governor’s budget accounted for the 7% reduction being removed;
therefore, removal of the 7% reduction was utilized in calculating the department’s recommended
appropriations. However, as the County share-of-cost for the IHSS program is under a MOE, the total
increase in costs associated with the 7% increase in hours will be offset by State and Federal revenues.
Other Charges
 Recommended funding of $46,058,164 reflects a 14% ($5,697,094) increase over the FY 2014-15
Adopted Budget based on projected monthly benefits costs paid and the adjusted IHSS MOE.
Recommended funding includes:
 IHSS MOE for FY 2015-16 of $28,210,612, based on prior year plus an inflation rate of 3.5%, per
legislation.
 Provider health benefits of $17,847,552 based on the benefit rate of $0.85 per hour and a
projected 1,749,760 average paid hours per month for FY 2015-16.
 Paid hours will be affected by the additional hours available after July 2015 to recipients if the
7% reduction is lifted. The recommended appropriations account for this impact.


Significant Program Changes
Effective July 1, 2012, the State implemented a Maintenance-of-Effort (MOE) for the IHSS program,
which includes the Public Authority. Prior to the IHSS MOE, the County share-of-cost for the Public
Authority was determined through statutory sharing ratios, and the County was responsible for
approximately 17.6% of the total cost. Under the MOE, the County share-of-cost became a set amount
that was equal to the actual County share-of-cost incurred by each County for FY 2011-12. The County
must pay that set amount regardless of the actual Public Authority expenditures. Based on current
statute, the IHSS MOE can be increased by the State for the following reasons: 1) County negotiated
IHSS provider wage and/or benefits increases; and 2) an annual inflation factor of 3.5% effective July 1st
of each fiscal year with the exception of years where there is ‘negative growth’ in 1991 Realignment
funds. The FY 2015-16 IHSS MOE recommended appropriations of $137,424 reflect a 3.5% ($4,647)
increase over the FY 2014-15 Adopted Budget.
Salaries and Benefits
 Salaries and Benefits, recommended at $846,932, represent a 67% ($338,449) increase over the FY
2014-15 Adopted Budget due to the cost of five additional staff positions that were added in February
2015 to assist with the increasing workload. Total staffing is recommended at 12 positions and
represents no change from current level.

current year based on Risk Management rates.
 Account 6600, Health Insurance Contribution, represents a 49% ($21,681) increase over the
current year due to the addition of five new positions current year.
 Account 6670, Administrative Benefits, reflect a 10% ($83) decrease from the current year based
on Risk Management rates.
 Vacancy Rate Discount is not included due to the size of the department with staffing of 12
positions.
Services and Supplies

current year due to an increase in the Department of Social Services In-Home Support Services
staff assisting with an increase in Public Authority functions.

based on Facility Services estimates based on current year actuals.
 Account 7416, Transportation Travel-County Garage, reflects a 100% ($878) increase over the
current year based on Fleet Services estimated fuel cost as the department is currently
experiencing some programmatic changes that should require additional travel.


Significant Program Changes
In compliance with Section 17600.20(c) of the Welfare & Institutions Code, a 10% transfer from the
Mental Health Account to the Health Account was approved by the Board of Supervisors on May 5, 2015
and was determined to be the most cost effective use of the available resources to maximize client
outcomes in FY 2015-16. The 10% transfer from the Mental Health Account to the Health Account will
mitigate a revenue decrease, as a result of the AB 85 redirection of Health Realignment funds to the
State. The Department of Behavioral Health identified Mental Health Realignment savings made
available by the Affordable Care Act (ACA) implementation, which shifted a portion of the indigent
population previously being served with mental health realignment dollars to Medi-Cal effective January
1, 2014.

online to multiple boards at any time and provide department staff the capability to efficiently manage
board rosters, appointments workflows and vacancies.
Salaries and Benefits
 Salaries and Benefits represent a 17% ($377,566) increase over the current year. Staffing is
recommended at 20 positions, an increase of 1 Deputy Clerk to the Board position that will assist
meeting the County and Board of Supervisors operational needs, including but not limited to: tracking
status of all contracts approved by the Board, compliance verification of Officials and members of

positions to Senior does not increase the total number of Board Member Assistant allocated
positions, but does provide the positions for staff with experience and leadership responsibilities
required in each supervisorial district office.
 Account 6200 – Extra-Help represents a 159% ($70,779) increase over current year and is based
on actual current year expenditures, estimated FY 2015-16 Extra-Help expenses, and object
level balancing across district divisional budgets.
 Account 6400 – Retirement Contribution represents an 18% ($127,628) increase over current
year and is due to an increase in current year full-time staff, salary adjustments, one new staff
position recommended for FY 2015-16, and the increase in FY 2015-16 retirement rates.
Services and Supplies
 Services and Supplies represent a decrease of 21% ($114,432) from FY 2014-15 Adopted Budget
primarily due to current year funding designated for the one-time Services and Supplies and staffing
transition costs of two new Board Members which is not required in FY 2015-16.

current year based on estimated expenses.

2014-15 Adopted Budget based on current staffing and projected need.
 Account 6400, Retirement Contributions, recommended at $642,755 reflect a 6% ($38,593)
increase over the FY 2014-15 Adopted Budget due to an increase in Regular Salaries and
Retirement Contribution rates.
Services and Supplies
 Services and Supplies, recommended at $146,477, reflect a 10% ($16,629) decrease from the FY
2014-15 Adopted Budget, primarily due to decreases in Data Processing Services and Utilities.
Recommended funding includes:

FY 2014-15 Adopted Budget due to budgeting $850,000 for the cost of updating the County General
Plan.
Recommended funding includes:
 Maintenance-Buildings and Grounds, ($595,000) recommended at the same level as the FY
2014-15 Adopted Budget based on projected expenditures for emergency repairs and costs
associated with maintaining County buildings and property leased to others. Due to the Facilities
Services Internal Service Fund (ISF) being relatively new and in order to keep department
charges at a reasonable level, reserves for emergency repairs are currently not included in the
ISF. The ISD administers these activities.
 PeopleSoft Financial Charges ($3,044) reflect a less than 1% ($18) decrease from the FY
2014-15 Adopted Budget based on rates provided by ISD. The charges reflect the required
share of the ISD ISF costs for processing PeopleSoft transactions for Org 2540. ISD administers
these activities.
 Countywide Audit and Related Consulting Services ($272,820) reflect a 56% ($97,820) increase
over the FY 2014-15 Adopted Budget based on an increase in the auditing contract and the
addition of $95,000 in reimbursed costs related to the audit of Community Service Areas (CSA)
being included in the FY 2015-16 Recommended Budget. Expenditures are for the annual
independent audits required by various Government (Govt.) Codes, U.S. Govt. Auditing
Standards, the Single Audit Act, and individual Federal/State grants. The audit is also necessary
for the County’s bond rating and is directly related to the cost of borrowing. Reimbursements in
the amount of $112,760 are expected to be received from third party payers to offset the audit
costs related to their agencies. The recommended funding also allows for other expert consulting
services that may be needed to complete financial statement disclosures. The ACTTC
administers these activities.
 Financial Advisor Services ($120,000) recommended at the same level as the FY 2014-15
Adopted Budget. These services are needed for a financial consultant for the TRAN and other
debt financing. County staff does not have the resources or expertise in these matters. Also
includes the cost of printing and binding official statements as well as online bidding charges.
The ACTTC administers these activities.
 Armored Transport Services ($55,000) recommended at the same level as the FY 2014-15
Adopted Budget. Services are needed to safeguard cash transport activities. The costs are
100% reimbursed by user departments. The ACTTC administers these activities.

Adopted Budget to allow County departments to accept debit/credit card (Merchant Card)
payments and provide electronic check processing services. These services facilitate receipt of
revenues and enhance customer convenience. The costs are 100% reimbursed by user
departments. The ACTTC administers these activities.
 Government Finance Officers Association (GFOA) ($1,100) recommended at the same level as
the FY 2014-15 Adopted Budget for funding to obtain a GFOA - Certificate of Achievement, which
was established to encourage local governments to go beyond minimum requirements when
preparing comprehensive annual financial reports. Achieving the certificate enhances confidence
in the reported financial position of the County. The ACTTC administers this activity.
 Standard & Poor’s ($23,000) reflects a 48% ($7,500) increase over the FY 2014-15 Adopted
Budget based on projected increases for costs to obtain bond ratings, which are required in order
to issue the County’s annual Tax Revenue Anticipation Notes (TRAN). The ACTTC administers
this activity.
 Sales Tax Recovery ($150,000) recommended at the same level as the FY 2014-15 Adopted
Budget for funding the recovery of sales tax revenues. Contracted services include analysis to
help ensure vendors properly report to the State all sales tax receipts applicable to the County.
Increased sales tax revenues fully-offset the cost of the contract. The ACTTC administers these
activities.
 Trustee Fees ($12,000) reflect a 9% ($1,000) increase over the FY 2014-15 Adopted Budget for
funding used to pay the Bank of New York for administering the 2012 Lease Revenue Refunding
Bonds (LRRB), Juvenile Justice Court Facility and Offices Lease Revenue Bonds (LRBs) and
Pension Obligation Bonds (POB), as the County does not have the expertise or resources to
perform these services. The POB portion ($5,100) is 100% offset from rates charged to the
County departments to cover POB debt. The ACTTC administers these activities.
 Actuarial Fees ($3,000) reflect a 50% ($1,000) increase over the FY 2014-15 Adopted Budget for
the cost of contracted actuarial services to implement Governmental Accounting Standards
Board (GASB) 68, which changes the way the County reports their pension liability on their
financial reports. The ACTTC administers these activities.
 Bond Counsel ($84,700) recommended at the same level as the FY 2014-15 Adopted Budget for
services required from outside bond counsel. County Counsel does not have the expertise
regarding municipal finance matters (e.g. bond issuance), and investors expect to see a
nationally recognized law firm on the bond documents. County Counsel administers these
activities and incurs the bond counsel expenditures in County Counsel Org 0710. Upon request,
these expenditures are later reversed from Org 0710 and charged to Org 2540.
 State and Federal Legislative Advocacy Services ($182,012) reflect a 12% ($20,000) increase
over the FY 2014-15 Adopted Budget based on a projected increase for contracted services with
State ($98,008) and Federal ($84,004) Legislative Advocates. This item provides lobbyist
services to more effectively represent the needs of the County on numerous issues at the State
and Federal levels. The CAO administers these activities.
 Annual Membership Dues for the Five Cities Economic Development Joint Powers Authority
(JPA) ($6,000) recommended at the same level as the FY 2014-15 Adopted Budget and
represents the projected cost for the County’s membership in the JPA. The JPA was established
to assist member agencies to develop local economic development resources, establish
cooperative relationships to pursue legislation, seek funding, plan the allocation of resources, and
implement the Regional Economic Development Program and strategies. The JPA now consists
of seven members including the cities of Fowler, Kingsburg, Orange Cove, Parlier, Reedley, and
Sanger, as well as the County of Fresno. Membership dues are proportionate to each member
agency’s population. The CAO administers these activities.
 Driver Alliant Insurance Liability ($275) recommended at the same level as the FY 2014-15
Adopted Budget for the Retirement Board's insurance coverage. Government Code Section
7511 requires the County to pay for premiums related to the non-recourse clause of fiduciary
liability insurance for the Fresno County Employees’ Retirement Association (FCERA) Board and
Administrator. The Code prohibits a public retirement plan from paying this charge. The bill is
received from FCERA and payment is processed by the CAO.
 Council of Governments (COG) Membership Dues ($15,500) recommended at the same level as
the FY 2014-15 Adopted Budget for annual membership dues that are required through the COG
Joint Powers Agreement (JPA). COG (a mandated State and Federal-designated Regional
Transportation and Metropolitan Planning agency) currently uses the dues for State and Federal
lobbying efforts which, cannot be funded from the Road Fund. Participation in the JPA is
necessary for the County to have a voice in regional decision-making and the programming of
hundreds of millions of dollars in regional and local transportation funding. The CAO administers
this item.
 Appraisal Fees ($20,000) reflects a 100% ($10,000) increase over the FY 2014-15 Adopted
Budget for the cost of appraising County property. In order for County property to be sold an
appraisal must be obtained. Funding will be used for the cost of obtaining appraisals as the
County potentially looks to sell vacant property. The CAO administers this item.
 Facility Operation and Maintenance for Vacant Spaces ($2,100,000) recommended at the same
level as the FY 2014-15 Adopted Budget based on updated actual and estimated costs of
utilities, and maintenance of vacant County building spaces including University Medical Center,
Elkhorn boot camp, and the 10th Street Juvenile Hall/Court facilities. These estimates could be
reduced or offset as a result of the Board's direction to consider the sale, lease, or increased use
of County properties. The costs do not benefit specific entities and therefore cannot be charged
to departments or grants. As such, the Facility Services ISF would not be able to recover
revenues for these costs so funding for this purpose needs to be absorbed by the General Fund
(Org 2540, Account 7345). The ISD administers this activity.
 Transportation, Travel and Education ($2,000) recommended at the same level as the FY 2014-
15 Adopted Budget for travel costs needed in order to get Standard & Poor’s bond ratings
associated with TRAN borrowing. This expenditure account (7415) is also used to pay for
American Express Corporate Card travel expenditures. Charges are then reversed and charged
to applicable departments. This activity is primarily administered by the ACTTC.
 Public Safety Realignment Act (AB 109) Planning Grant ($200,000) recommended at the same
level as the FY 2014-15 Adopted Budget and is used to provide reimbursement for the planning
grant activities of various County departments. AB 109 Planning Grant funding fully-offsets these
costs. The CAO administers this item.
Other Charges
 Other Charges, recommended at ($1,640,941), represent a 77% ($5,383,258) decrease from FY

 Fresno City/County Historical Society ($12,500) recommended at the same level as the FY
2014-15 Adopted Budget and provides non-mandated funding for the operation of the Kearney
Mansion Museum complex and interior maintenance of the Kearney Mansion. The CAO

Works & Planning (PW&P).
 415 Retirement Replacement Plan ($125,000) recommended at the same level as the FY 2014-
15 Adopted Budget for payments to past County of Fresno employees who have retired and have
compensation above the IRS tax limit for retirement. The recommended funding, which is
required by IRS Code 415, is based on projected expenditures as provided by the ACTTC.
These costs are fully-offset by a reimbursement to Org 2540 which is made available from a like
reduction in the Retirement Contribution to FCERA. The ACTTC administers this activity.
 Amador Plan Fire Services ($894,048) recommended at the same level as the FY 2014-15
Adopted Budget, based on the proposed agreement with CAL FIRE for FY 2015-16. The FY
2015-16 agreement funding provides for non-mandated fire protection services during the nonfire
season (generally November through May) at four of five fire stations located in select foothill
and mountain areas including Piedra, Blasingame, Shaver Lake, and Squaw Valley. The Hurley
station will be funded by the Fresno County Fire Protection District. Payments under this
agreement are based on actual costs, which are contingent on the length of the fire season. The
agreement with CAL FIRE is presented to the Board during the fiscal year for retroactive
approval. The CAO administers these activities.
 Cash Shortages ($4,000) recommended at the same level as the FY 2014-15 Adopted Budget
based on actual and projected expenditures. Consistent with Management Directive 740, cash
shortage reimbursements to County departments have been budgeted in Org 2540. Shortages
are recommended for approval if there is no proof of fraud or gross negligence and the loss is not
covered by insurance. The ACTTC administers these activities.
 Support of Organizations ($599,893) reflects a 45% ($186,134) increase over the FY 2014-15
Adopted Budget due to the addition of funding for the Local Agency Formation Commission
Support (LAFCo) as a line item account. Previously LAFCo funding was budgeted in Org 4371.
The Support of Organizations account was created to fund community service programs the
Board adopts funding for each fiscal year as described below:
 Local Agency Formation Commission Support ($176,134) reflects a 10% ($21,671) decrease
from FY 2014-15 Adopted Budget, which previously was budgeted in Org 4371. In FY 2014-15
the County determined for future years to dissolve County Budget Org 4371 and budget the
County’s contribution in Org 2540. The County will continue to pay LAFCo 50% of the annual
LAFCo budget passed by the LAFCo Board annually, as required. The CAO administers this
activity.
 Cooperative Extension ($315,000) recommended at the same level as the FY 2014-15 Adopted
Budget. In FY 2012-13, the County and the Regents of the University of California (University)
determined for future years to discontinue use of the County Budget Org 7610 and create a
partnership agreement in which the County will pay the University directly an amount adopted by
the Board each fiscal year. The CAO administers this activity.
 Veterans Memorial Museum ($15,000) remains at the same level as the FY 2014-15 Adopted
Budget for a non-mandated contribution to the Veterans Memorial Museum to promote, improve,

development marketing programs and promoting job creation in Fresno County, which is
consistent with the economic element of the General Plan. The CAO administers this activity.
 Fresno-Madera Area Agency on Aging (FMAAA) ($44,509) remains at the same level as the FY
2014-15 Adopted Budget and reflects Fresno County's financial share of a JPA between the
County, City of Fresno, and the County of Madera to provide the FMAAA’s required match. This
allows the FMAAA to receive Federal and State funding for the provision of senior services. The
CAO administers this activity.
 Volunteer Fire Department Contribution ($11,250) remains at the same level as the FY 2014-15
Adopted Budget and represents the County's non-mandated contribution to five Volunteer Fire
Departments (i.e. Big Creek, Hume Lake, Huntington Lake, Mountain Valley, and Pine Ridge) to
purchase various types of firefighting clothing and equipment. The CAO administers these
activities.
 Proposition 42 MOE payment ($0) represents a 100% ($5,569,392) decrease from the FY 2014-
15 Adopted Budget. In FY 2009-10, the adopted budget included Proposition 42 funding that
required a MOE contribution from the County’s General Fund in the amount of $5,569,392. The
FY 2009-10 MOE payment was deferred in accordance with California Revenue and Taxation
Code Section 7104.2(f)(6) until FY 2010-11. Legislative action allowed the County to further
defer the payment until June 30, 2015. In FY 2014-15, as a result of Assembly Bill (AB) 2731,
Fresno County was granted a five-year extension to meet its Prop 42 MOE requirement, with the
stipulation that the County expend the funds to provide specialty medical services. Funding in
the amount of $5,569,392 is included in the FY 2015-16 Recommended Budget for Org 5240,
County Medical Services and will be used to reimburse certain specialty medical care for Fresno
County residents not eligible for MISP or ACA.

based on actual and projected expenditures and represent the County's obligation under
California Commercial Code Division 3 to reimburse businesses for fraudulent or forged checks.
The ACTTC administers this activity.
Other Financing Uses
 Other Financing Uses are recommended at $6,696,864 and reflect a 1% ($89,056) decrease from FY
2014-15 Adopted Budget. The decrease is due to the cost of providing Courthouse Park Security no
longer being included in Org 2540. The decrease in object level appropriations is partially offset by
the $150,000 cost for on-going post closure monitoring of the Coalinga Regional Disposal site.
Recommended funding includes:
 Additional Courthouse Park Security ($0) reflects a 100% ($210,000) decrease from FY 2014-15

reflects a 100% ($27,601) increase over the FY 2014-15 Adopted Budget for costs associated
with providing administrative support for the HLRC. The Library Org 7511 staff will provide the
administrative support and costs will be reimbursed based on actual costs from Org 2540.

meetings throughout the year at various County locations; maintaining HLRC records and
updating the Library and County website; working with the Clerk to the Board to maintain the
status of the 17 member commission; and tracking agenda items and applications turned in to the
commission for review. In previous years the cost of administrative support had been provided
through the Library, but upon review of the administrative support function, it was determined that
cost could not be off-set with Library Measure B funds. The Library administers this item.
 Operating Transfer Out to Debt Service ($6,328,985) reflects a $7,662 decrease from FY 2014-
15 Adopted Budget and includes:
 2012 Lease Revenue Refunding Bonds (LRRB) ($1,934,800) reflect a $6,500 decrease from FY

 More information on the above debt service payments is available in the Narrative for Org 0124–Debt
Service. The ACTTC administers these activities.

through a TRAN issuance. The TRAN issuance enables the County to maintain a positive cash flow
until anticipated taxes and revenues are received throughout the fiscal year.
The recommended funding of $2,700,000 for FY 2015-16 is based on an assumed $90,000,000 debt
issuance at a 3% interest rate. This represents the same level of funding as recommended for FY 2014-
15. If the final debt issuance amount and interest rate for FY 2015-16 result in a debt requirement that is
significantly less than what is budgeted, any savings would be available for re-appropriation as approved

payment is transferred from the Interest and Miscellaneous Expenditures budget, where it is budgeted as
net County cost.
Other Information
Pension Obligation Bonds (POB)
 Fresno County has issued POB on three occasions. In March 1998, Fresno County issued
$184,910,000 of taxable POB with a 10-year amortization to fund the Unfunded Actuarial Accrued
Liability (UAAL) of the Fresno County Employee’s Retirement Association. In March 2002, these
bonds were partially refunded in order to extend the debt servicing of the bonds to an 18-year
amortization period to provide budget relief. In addition, in 2004, a total of $327,897,749 in fixed rate
bonds were issued with a 30-year amortization, and a total of $75 million in variable rate bonds were
issued. The $75 million variable rate bonds were converted to fixed rate bonds on September 12,
2006 at a fixed rate of 5.56%. The maturity schedule of the converted bonds remained the same. In
FY 2008-09, the debt service for the 1998 POBs was completed. A total of $41,034,946 in debt
service payments is required in FY 2015-16, which includes all administration fees associated with
the bonds. See debt service schedule and remaining maturity for all three issuances following this
narrative.

Amounts necessary to timely pay the POB debt service payments have been incorporated into the
County’s FY 2015-16 retirement rates and are collected from departments each pay period.
Tobacco Securitization Bonds
 In August of 1998 a Master Settlement Agreement (MSA) occurred to resolve cigarette smokingrelated
litigation between the settling states and the Participating Manufacturers (PMs) and released
the PMs from past and present smoking-related claims in exchange for certain payments to be made
to the states. Fresno County was allocated a share of the Tobacco Settlement Revenues (TSRs) by
the State of California through a Memorandum of Understanding. The Fresno County Tobacco
Funding Corporation (Corporation) was incorporated June 13, 2002. It is a nonprofit public benefit
organization as defined by Internal Revenue Code Section 501C(3). The Corporation is a member of
the California County Tobacco Securitization Agency (Agency), a joint powers agency created in
November 2000 by the County of Fresno and eight other California Counties.
2002 Bond Issuance
 On June 18, 2002, the Board of Supervisors adopted Resolution No. 02-329 which approved the sale
of certain County’s TSRs. Under the terms of the sales agreement, the County realized through
bond proceeds the present value of 75% of its TSRs and continued to receive 25% of its annual
TSRs. On July 25, 2002, the County of Fresno (County) through the Corporation issued $92,955,000
in Tobacco Settlement Asset-Backed Bonds in part to finance the costs of construction and
development of the County’s Juvenile Justice Campus (JJC). The 2002 bond proceeds were only
used to fund the costs of the JJC. The remaining appropriations have time restrictions.
2006 Bond Issuance
 On February 7, 2006, the Board provided direction to staff to proceed with the analysis of issuing
additional tobacco bonds. The analysis found that a subordinate bond offering could result in
between $31 million to $42 million in net proceeds to the County. The Board determined that given
the considerable risks associated with the receipt of the TSRs over the course of the next years that
the associated sale of these future TSRs by the County represented a good opportunity. The 2006
Bonds were structured to shift the greatest amount of risk to the investors. The bonds were sold as
subordinate lien Capital Appreciation Bonds (CABs). CABs are debt instruments where interest is
accumulated and at maturity the principal and interest are paid in one lump sum. Further the CABs
were wrapped around the existing 2002 Tobacco Bonds, meaning the 2006 Bonds would be paid
only after all of the 2002 Bonds are paid in full. On April 12, 2006 the County received $37,794,190
in bond proceeds which was placed in an endowment fund to be used for capital expenditures.
As of April 28, 2015, the County had $5,569,819 in uncommitted Tobacco Bond proceeds available for
qualified capital projects from both issuances.


Contingencies
 Contingencies are recommended at $571,823 which reflect a 18% ($128,177) decrease from the FY
2014-15 Adopted Budget. On September 16, 2014, the Department of Social Services transferred
$88,394 to Contingencies to off-set a FY 2013-14 overage, in which, the Department spent $88,394
more in net County cost than was budgeted. February 24, 2015, the Department of Social Services
transferred $11,303 to Contingencies as a result of an increase in Realignment revenue. On March
24, 2015, $154,220 was transferred to the Auditor-Controller/Treasurer-Tax Collector (ACTTC), to
make a one-time payment to Hinderliter, de Llamas & Associates (HDL) for auditing services
conducted on behalf of the County of Fresno. As a result of the work performed by HDL, the County
received $1,028,130 in additional Proposition 172 revenue that had been miscalculated by the State
for prior years. At the end of the fiscal year unused appropriations for Contingencies will fall to fund
balance and are included in the funding of the FY 2015-16 Recommended Budget. After budget
adoption, during the fiscal year Contingencies require a 4/5 vote to access funding
General Reserves
 A $2,237,321 contribution to the General Reserves is recommended for FY 2015-16. The FY 2015-
16 General Reserve contribution represents 0.75% of the total FY 2015-16 Countywide Revenues
amount of $298.3 million. With this contribution, the General Reserve balance will increase to
$18,723,778 to address potential future liabilities. The General Reserve, except in cases of a legally
declared emergency may only be decreased at the time of adopting the budget. The general reserve
may be increased any time during the fiscal year by a 4/5 vote.
Designations
 Three designations have been included in the FY 2015-16 Recommended Budget in the amount of
$17,200,000. Designations require a 4/5 vote to access funding.
Pension Obligation Bond Third Party Payer
 A designation in the amount of $10,000,000 has been reserved to address the potential disallowance
of Pension Obligation Bond (POB) costs claimed to third party funding sources, such as federal
grants, for a portion of the refinanced pension obligation bonds. Principles governing federal cost
reimbursements are set out in the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-87 (A-87).
OMB A-87 treats pension plan costs as fringe benefits that are allowable to be claimed, including
POBs. In March of 1998, the County issued POBs in the amount of $184,910,000 to cover the
Unfunded Actuarial Accrued Liability (UAAL). Due to the State of California’s economy and stagnant
growth in Countywide revenues, the County issued Taxable POBs, 2002 Refunding Series.
Approximately $117,000,000 of the 1998 POBs were refunded. By refunding the bonds, the County
was able to reduce its annual debt service and extend its debt service schedule out 10 years, but in
doing so, the County incurred an additional $77 million in debt service payments. At the time of the
2002 POB issuance, the County of Fresno was not aware of the potential for future denial of claims,
as correspondence from the Federal Department of Health and Human Services, regarding issuance
guidelines relative to allowable costs on refunding POB that increase the total debt service was not
circulated to the County until February of 2003. To date, no federal claims have been denied
reimbursement for reasons concerning claiming POB costs. It is estimated that the potential cost of
the disallowance is $50 million in total and $10,000,000 for FY 2015-16. The County and their
advisors have attempted to resolve this issue with the State Controller’s Office, but the County has
been instructed that no action can be taken until such time that a claim for reimbursement for the
additional POB costs is disallowed. It is the County’s intent to fully appeal any and all amounts
disallowed through the Federal Government’s administrative appeals process. The recommended
addition of $10,000,000 in FY 2015-16 would bring the total amount reserved for POB Disallowances
to $18,957,503.
Sheriff Vehicle Replacement
 A designation in the amount of $700,000 has been reserved for Sheriff Vehicle Replacement. On
May 5, 2015, the Board approved the creation of a Sheriff Vehicle Replacement Designation. In FY
2014-15 the Sheriff-Coroner made available $600,000 for inclusion in the Designation. The FY 2015-
16 Recommended Budget includes an additional $700,000 made available from the Sheriff-Coroner’s
FY 2015-16 net County cost allocation, to be reserved for Sheriff Vehicle Replacement, bringing the
total Designation amount to $1,300,000. The Sheriff-Coroner’s Office maintains a fleet of patrol
vehicles to provide a law enforcement presence for the unincorporated areas of the County’s 6000
square miles. As a General Fund department, the Sheriff’s Office does not charge itself
“depreciation” for the replacement of Sheriff patrol vehicles. Because of the wear and tear and
extended mileage on the patrol fleet, repairs needed to keep many of the vehicles operational now
include engines, transmissions and other repairs that exceed the salvage value of the vehicle. As
part of the annual budget process, the Sheriff will include recommendations for funding allocations to
the Designation from the department’s net County cost (NCC) and any available NCC carryover. In
budget preparation the Sheriff-Coroner will continue to review the level of success achieved in
bringing the patrol fleet to a timely and orderly replacement schedule. After the department has
made the first initial replacement of all patrol vehicles (seven year schedule), the department will
transition to replacement funding from the Vehicle Replacement Designation.
Budget Mitigation
 A designation in the amount of $6,500,000 has been reserved for County budget mitigation. This
represents the amount of funding available for the Board in making adjustments in budget hearings,
to mitigate potential impacts in the FY 2015-16 State Budget or during the fiscal year.
FY 2014-15 Designations
 The FY 2014-15 Adopted Budget included three designations totaling $22,762,003.
 A designation in the amount of $8,957,503 was reserved to address the potential disallowance of
Pension Obligation Bond (POB) costs claimed to third party funding sources, such as federal
grants, for a portion of the refinanced pension obligation bonds. To date, no federal claims have
been denied reimbursement for reasons concerning claiming POB costs. The balance of the FY
2014-15 reserved amount $8,957,503 will remain in the designation.
 A designation in the amount of $7,854,500 was reserved to address pending liabilities that could
occur during FY 2014-15. On January 13, 2015, $50,000 was transferred to Capital Projects Org
1910 to fund costs related to pursuing acquisition of land adjacent to the former Coroner’s facility,
fronting on Teilman, to enable the County to build a permanent animal control facility. On
February 10, 2015, $1,590,000 was transferred to Public Works and Planning Coalinga Disposal
Site Org 9028, to provide funding to complete the final closure of the Coalinga Disposal Site. The
remaining $6,214,500 in the FY 2014-15 budget mitigation designation will be included in the FY
2015-16 Recommended Budget as fund balance used to fund NCC allocations.
 A designation in the amount of $5,950,000 was reserved to address potential staffing needs in
the Fresno County Jail related to the Quentin Hall settlement. A total of $2,509,449 of this
designation has been included in the FY 2015-16 Recommended Budget of the Sheriff-Coroner
Org 3111 to fund Phase One (51 correctional staff) of a 3-year staffing plan for additional Sheriff
correctional staff. It is recommended the remaining balance of $3,440,551 remain in the
designation to fund plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees and costs and required facility modifications related
to the Quentin Hall litigation in addition to annual monitoring and court expert costs for four years
as part of the settlement. Transfer of these funds into the proper Org for payment of these costs
will be included as part of the settlement agreement presented to the Board for approval. Unless
directed otherwise by the Board, any remaining balance will remain in the designation to partially
offset costs associated with Phase Two (43 additional correctional staff) of the 3-year staffing
plan in FY 2016-17.


Significant Program Changes
The FY 2015-16 Recommended Budget includes the addition of a Personnel Analyst and a Personnel
Technician - Confidential position that will be utilized primarily to meet the demand for recruitments. It is

recruitments are performed.
A second Personnel Technician – Confidential position will be utilized to work with the
Auditor/Controller’s Office Payroll unit to perform systematic time card and work code testing to reduce

Significant Program Changes
During the current fiscal year, ACTTC identified issues with the classification of certain fund subclass
combinations within PeopleSoft. Namely, resources that should have been reported as part of the
Primary Government (County of Fresno), and accounted for, budgeted, and reported, in PeopleSoft as
either the General Fund or a Special Revenue Fund, were classified and accounted for as Trust and
Agency Funds in PeopleSoft. Under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, Trust and Agency
Funds, are to be used only to account for funds that the County is holding in a custodial capacity on
behalf of other government agencies (Special Districts, School Districts, etc.). Through this project the
ACTTC identified over 200 fund/subclass combinations that required movement in PeopleSoft.
Scheduled completion of the project is July 1, 2015, with budgeting, accounting for these funds to begin
with FY 2015-16. The June 30, 2014 CAFR incorporated these changes for financial reporting purposes.

these needs, the Library will add 3.5 Library Assistants and 1.0 Library Aide positions to its Public
Service divisions. The Library is also adding 1.0 Groundskeeper I to the current workforce of 2.5
groundskeepers to maintain the 36 Library locations throughout the County and 1.0 Driver to the
Materials Handling and Delivery division to eliminate the use of the extra-help driver the Library has used

Reedley to replace the current branches that do not adequately meet the needs of their corresponding
growing communities. The department may return to your Board to seek additional appropriations for the
purchase or renovation of such facilities during FY 2015-16. At this time, there is only one improvement
included in the budget.

Services and Supplies
 Services and Supplies, recommended at $2,711,540, represent a 7% ($217,342) decrease from the
FY 2014-15 Adopted Budget primarily due to a decrease in Information Technology programming

are needed to perform seasonal inspections due to the drought resulting in a decreased need for
Fleet vehicles. Additionally, several older, high mileage vehicles owned by the department were
replaced resulting in a projected decrease in vehicle maintenance costs.


Significant Program Changes
In 2014, the Board implemented two new programs intended to address current economic conditions.
These included the Building Permit Fee Deferral and Rapid Response Processing programs. These
programs were funded during the FY 2014-15 budget adoption process and will continue to be
implemented by department staff in the Development Services division. Based on activity levels in
various work areas as well as experience gained in implementing the two programs over the past year,
staffing resources have and will continue to be adjusted to efficiently deliver these programs, as well as
the other work programs needed to serve the department’s customers.

Plotter/Scanner for the Capital Projects division.
(1) Plotter/Scanner ........................................ $22,000 ........ New


Significant Program Changes
Some of the increase in appropriations is reflective of the several large multi-year projects that have
been awarded to the County. Staff has been very successful in applying for and being awarded several
projects from different funding agencies. Staff has been successful in obtaining funding for four active
transportation projects that total $1,254,000. Also in the Highway Bridge program, administered by the
Federal Highway Administration, staff has been able to secure $59,999,000 to replace or maintain
existing bridges. Because the projects are multi-year, the funds will be distributed in increments through
FY 2017-18. The overall budget still reflects an allocation of Measure “C” and routine road maintenance
projects that will be awarded for construction or have significant design completed in the coming fiscal years.
To meet current number of projects, it is recommended that seven positions be added in FY 2015-16.
The additional staff will be utilized in the Design and Construction divisions. The additional positions will
bring the staffing level to 203. Without the additional staff, the department will not be able to deliver
currently funded projects within the timeline allotted by the Federal Highway Administration.
The department continues a team-based approach in seeking to identify avenues for improving service to
clients and other County departments. This is evident in the scheduling of heavy equipment usage
between road maintenance yards to promote sharing of the equipment. This effort has allowed the
divisions to reduce the heavy equipment fleet by approximately 29% from the levels in FY 2012-13. This
includes working with other jurisdictions on projects of common interest. The use of advanced electronic
and computer technology in areas such as Geographic Information Systems, and the Cost Accounting
Management System (CAMS) are being employed.
Road Maintenance
The FY 2015-16 programs consist of the following components:
Day Labor Rehabilitation, Specific Maintenance Projects, and
Pavement Seals and Maintenance Overlays .................... ........ $ 6.11 million
Contract Preventive Maintenance ..................................... ........ $13.75 million
Routine Road Maintenance Activities ............................... ........ $10.62 million
Traffic Signs and Striping .................................................. ........ $ 1.33 million
Traffic Safety and Operations ........................................... ........ $ 1.83 million
Total .................................................................................. ........ $33.64 million
 A total of $6.11 million is recommended for day labor rehabilitation and specific maintenance projects
for roads. These funds will be expended for the rehabilitation of approximately 33 miles of selected
lower traffic volume roads by day labor forces. Approximately $300,000 (not included in the $6.11
million allocation) has been budgeted for maintenance of private roads in the County Service Areas
(CSAs). The CSAs will reimburse the Road Fund for all maintenance work.
 The recommended $13.75 million for contract preventive maintenance projects will provide for the
maintenance treatment of approximately 30 miles of chip seal projects, and 20 miles of asphalt
concrete overlay. The preventive maintenance allocation also reflects $1.70 million of Congestion
Mitigation and Air Quality (CMAQ) shoulder projects throughout the County.
 Pothole patching, shoulder maintenance, and other routine road maintenance activities, including
culvert maintenance, storm damage repairs, tree trimming, and snow removal are recommended at
$10.62 million. The allocation of expenditures to the various general maintenance categories can
vary in any given year. For example, in years when above average precipitation occurs, the cost for
snow removal, storm response and signing, and storm damage repairs will consume more of these
allocations than in normal years.
 Traffic signs and striping, including installation and maintenance of traffic signs, pavement markings,
and line striping is recommended at $1.33 million. This allocation includes funding for agreements
with Caltrans for Caltrans-operated traffic signals at joint State/County intersections at an annual cost
of approximately $50,000; the City of Fresno for the maintenance of County-owned traffic signals and
lighting at an annual cost of approximately $140,000; and with a private contractor at an annual cost
of $25,000 to maintain other traffic signals and lighting not maintained by the State or the City of
Fresno.
 Included in the $33.64 million allocation in the proposed budget for road maintenance and traffic
signs and striping, there is an allocation of $1.83 million for traffic safety and operations activities.
This allocation provides for the preparation and review of Traffic Safety Studies to determine the
need for four-way stop signs, other traffic control devices, traffic control needs, review and approval
of encroachment permits for work to be done within the County road right-of-way, issuance of
oversize load permits for County roads, and various other operational and safety roadway related
activities. This allocation also includes the Traffic Census (traffic count program) section in the
Maintenance and Operations division.
Road and Bridge Construction

year due to reduced rates provided by Risk Management.
Services and Supplies
 Services and Supplies reflect a 4% ($1,694,779) decrease from the FY 2014-15 Adopted Budget
primarily due to decreases in road maintenance services and professional engineering consultants
for bridge design.
Recommended funding includes:
 An allocation for the purchase of materials used in the maintenance of roads and traffic
operations, signs and striping ($5.83 million).
 Account 7295, Professional and Specialized Services, represent a 12% ($669,991) increase over
the current year for activities performed by private firms such as street sweeping, tree trimming
and removal, roadside vegetation control, and other owner operated equipment such as trucking
services when needed. Also included in this allocation are services provided by specialized and
consultant service providers, such as engineering and environmental and geo-technical review.
Additional services such as technology, personnel and financial services necessary for the
operation of the division have been budgeted in Account 7910, Operating Transfers Out. Design

 Account 7250, Memberships, reflect an increase over from the current year of 1,313% ($15,100)
due to the additional participation in the California Stewardship Council, which provides a forum
for local governments to comply with unfunded mandates, and it also serves as a source for
technical and educational resources to promote management, regulatory compliance, and
program implementation (e.g., workshops and webinars, presentation materials, speakers,
brochures).
 Account 7295, Professional & Specialized Services, reflect a decrease from the current year of
22% ($460,609) due to the reallocation of the American Avenue Refund Trust fund to the
American Avenue Landfill, Org 9026.
 Account 7400, Special Departmental Expense, reflects a decrease from the current year of 64%
($734,502) due no longer budgeting for the Blue Hills letter of credit loan reimbursement to Risk
Management (final payment made in the current year), and the completion and reimbursement of
the FY 2013-14 HHW grant program (HD 21).


Significant Program Changes
The Coalinga Disposal Site (CDS) has been permanently closed and is now in post-closure
maintenance. The estimated annual post-closure cost of $188,389 will be partially funded through an
operating transfer in of $150,000 from Interest and Miscellaneous Expenditures, Org 2540.
American Avenue Disposal Site (AADS) completed the Phase III Modules 4, 5 & 6 Landfill Expansion.
The expansion was required to comply with the fill sequence plan developed by Shaw Environmental &
Infrastructure Inc. and for the preparation of the Phase I Reclamation Project (clean closure, removal of
waste from the 30 acres of unlined area) and to comply with Title 27 CCR requirements.
In FY 2014-15, a new agreement with the City of Fresno (City) was negotiated to decrease the per ton
rate charged to the City for waste hauled to AADS. This resulted in a reduction in operating hours for
AADS and the elimination of five positions.
A Clean-Up Abatement Order (98-702) was issued by the Regional Water Quality Control Board
(RWQCB) in 1998, due to volatile organic compounds detected in the AADS groundwater monitoring
wells adjacent the Phase I fill area (unlined 30 acre area). Since 2005, the AADS RWQCB Waste
Discharge Requirements (WDR’s) have indicated that the County proposes to remove the waste from the
unlined portion of the site and place it into a lined area. The Phase I area also resides in the future fill
areas of Phase III, Modules 11 & 12 and in order for Phase III Modules 11 & 12 to be constructed, Phase
I will need to be clean closed in accordance with Title 27. Staff has budgeted $15,000,000 to fund the
clean closure in FY 2015-16. The Phase I Reclamation Project is estimated to take approximately three
to five years to complete from project initiation to regulatory approval of clean closure. The potential risk
in not performing the Phase I Reclamation Project may result in a cease and desist order from the
RWQCB, including the inability to accept and process waste.
Salaries and Benefits

Specialized Services in the Coalinga Disposal Site budget.
 Account 7400, Special Departmental Expense, reflects an increase over current year adopted
budget of 45% ($991,458). The primary variance is due to transferring the American Avenue
Trust Fund Voucher program from Resources Org 9015 to AADS Org 9026. The program
transfer was per the direction of the Auditor-Controller/Treasurer-Tax Collector.

Salaries and Benefits
 Salaries and Benefits, recommended at $1,911,092, represent a 7% ($129,445) increase over the FY
2014-15 Adopted Budget primarily due to the recommended transfer of two positions from Org 9015 -
Resources. Standby pay is required as the water and sewer operations are 24/7 and, at least one
operator for the mountain areas and one for the valley areas, are on-call 24/7 in case of
emergencies. Staffing is recommended at 18 positions, an increase of 2 positions recommended for

Blanket Purchase Orders, due to mainline repairs, well rehabilitation projects, pump
replacements, and step tank maintenance in various water and sewer districts. These Blanket
Purchase Orders are expected to be renewed in FY 2015-16 for similar type repairs, projects and
upgrades. The remaining increase is due to higher chemical costs for the Juvenile Justice
Campus (JJC) water and wastewater treatment plants.
 Account 7385, Small Tools & Instruments, represent a 33% ($3,000) increase over the current
year due to additional tools needed by field staff.
