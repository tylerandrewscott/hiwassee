Significant Program Changes
In October of 2013, the Community Corrections Partnership (CCP), implementing the Public Safety
Realignment Act of 2011 pursuant to Assembly Bill (AB) 109, approved funding for four Correctional
Sergeant positions to supervise Correctional Officers previously added to open jail floors and four
Program Technician positions to implement a records unit to process jail commitment packets. The
addition of these positions with AB 109 funding was subsequently approved by the Board of
Supervisors.
Reorganization of the Sheriff’s Personnel unit was approved by the Board of Supervisors (Board)
midyear FY 2013-14 resulting in the addition of one Senior Staff Analyst to supervise the staff, one Staff
Analyst as a lead in the unit and the replacement of two Office Assistants with two Program Technicians
to perform the paraprofessional duties.
Based on a review of staffing needs, the local court in conjunction with the Sheriff, approved the
addition of three Deputy Sheriff positions with Trial Court Security funding and the addition of these
positions midyear FY 2013-14 was subsequently approved by the Board. The recommended budget
also includes the addition of one Sheriff’s Sergeant and two Deputy Sheriff positions with Trial Court
Security funding.
On November 12, 2013 and December 3, 2013, the Board approved the consolidation of the Coroner’s
office with the Sheriff’s office effective January 1, 2015. The recommended budget includes the
addition of one Sheriff’s Lieutenant position to oversee the consolidation of the Coroner’s operations
with the Sheriff’s office.
Salaries and Benefits
 Salaries and Benefits recommended at $149,500,218 reflect a 6% ($8,116,593) increase over the
current year adopted budget primarily due to full-year funding for positions added midyear FY 2013-
14, the addition of four positions, and an increase in retirement rates. Staffing is recommended for
1,057 positions, an increase of 4 positions.

with the Inmate Welfare Trust Fund program in this Org. This fund offsets the cost for programs
related to inmate services, including salaries, benefits, services and supplies. In prior years, the
appropriations for Services and Supplies were not included in the general fund budget. This change
will ensure conformance to accounting standards and practices and allow the Sheriff’s office to
operate more efficiently as only one ledger will be required.

Significant Program Changes
On December 3, 2013, the Board of Supervisors approved an amendment to the County of Fresno
Ordinance Code to repeal the consolidation of elective offices of the Coroner-Public Administrator to be
effective January 1, 2015. The Public Administrator was consolidated with the elective office of the
District Attorney and the Coroner was consolidated with the elective office of Sheriff.
Salaries and Benefits
 Salaries and Benefits recommended at $2,028,747 represent a 9% ($172,150) increase over the FY
2013-14 Adopted Budget primarily as the result of an increase in retirement costs and costs
associated with Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) changes. Staffing is recommended at 14
positions.
Recommended funding includes:
 Account 6100 Regular Salaries recommended at $1,108,734 reflect a 4% ($44,858) increase
over the FY 2013-14 Adopted Budget due to increase costs associated with MOU changes.
 Funding for 10 Coroner division positions to cover a population of approximately 959,000 over
the 6,000 square miles of Fresno County 24/7, including: 1 Coroner-Public Administrator through
December 31, 2014; 1 Chief Forensic Pathologist; 1 Forensic Pathologist; 1 Senior Deputy
Coroner; 5 Deputy Coroners; and 1 Forensic Autopsy Technician. Additionally the recommended
budget includes funding for a Sheriff Lieutenant for one-half of the fiscal year, when the Sheriff
takes over the operations of the Coroner on January 1, 2015.
 Currently there are six budgeted Deputy Coroner positions which equates to an approximate ratio
of 0.63 positions per 100,000 in population. In 2013, Kern County had a ratio of 1.0 Deputy
Coroner positions per 100,000 population and Sacramento County had a ratio of 0.76 Deputy
Coroner positions per 100,000 population.
 Full-year funding for four Public Administrator positions, including: one Deputy Public
Administrator; one Senior Probate Assistant; one Estate Property Assistant; and one Account
Clerk.
 Account 6200 Extra-Help recommended at $38,794 a 7% ($2,851) decrease from the FY
2013-14 Adopted Budget based on the department’s effort to reduce Extra-Help costs. Extra-
Help funding includes one Administrative Secretary-Confidential (2.4 hours per week until
December 31, 2014), Deputy Coroner coverage (2.5 hours per week), two Histology Technicians
(8 hours per week), and two Forensic Autopsy Technician positions coverage (16 hours per
week) for the weekends and as-needed for back-up.
Services and Supplies
 Services and Supplies recommended at $925,267 represent a 21% ($160,491) increase over the FY
2013-14 Adopted Budget primarily as a result of an increase in Data Processing Services and
Professional & Specialized Services off-set by a decrease in Facility Operation & Maintenance.
Recommended funding includes:
 Account 7345 Facility Operation & Maintenance recommended at $95,702 reflects a 20%
($23,391) decrease from the FY 2013-14 Adopted Budget primarily due to the department
working with the Internal Services Department to cut costs at the Regional Forensic Center by
reducing janitorial services to three days a week and normal day-to-day maintenance being
performed by Coroner staff.
 Account 7295 Professional & Specialized Services recommended at $386,500 reflect a 36%
($101,500) increase over the FY 2013-14 Adopted Budget due to the department issuing a
Request for Quotation for Body Removal Service, Forensic Toxicology, and County Cremation.
The base rates for these services are expected to increase and the estimated costs are included
in the department’s FY 2014-15 recommended budget.
 Account 7296 Data Processing Services recommended at $225,280 reflect a 30% ($52,029)
increase over the FY 2013-14 Adopted Budget due to an increase in the number of hours
budgeted for ITSD staff to update the department’s Coroner and Medical Examiners (CME) data
base program to help streamline departmental operations. Additionally, the department is
projecting an increase in the amount of data storage needed to store high resolution photos of
autopsies for case review by Pathologists, used by attorneys and in court.


Significant Program Changes
On September 17, 2013, the District Attorney received approval from the Board of Supervisors to
establish the Electronic Filing (E-filing) unit in conjunction with the Sheriff and the cities of Fresno, Clovis,
Coalinga, Huron, Firebaugh, Mendota, Orange Cove, Parlier, Fowler, Kerman, Kingsburg, Reedley,
Sanger, and Selma. Law enforcement agencies submit requests for criminal prosecution through a
secure electronic server in lieu of physically transporting paper reports. The establishment of this unit
added eight Office Assistant positions and one Supervising Office Assistant position to the District
Attorney’s Office. The Sheriff and all the cities of Fresno County agreed that the cost of the unit would
be reimbursed through their funding from the California Board of State and Community Corrections
(BSCC). Successfully established by mid-December 2013, the unit allows Fresno County law
enforcement agencies to generate savings of staff time and money (e.g., travel and paper costs) which in
turn has increased resources to fight crime in their communities. The County has benefited from this
implementation with a standardized, easily accessible case review and filing procedure and initiated a
process to build a bridge in the foreseeable future for paperless filing with the court.
The District Attorney reviewed current staffing allocations and determined that span of control for
supervisors in investigations has greatly increased with restoration of staff. Addressing the span of
control is necessary for more efficiencies. The recommended budget deletes two vacant Senior District
Attorney Investigator positions, adds three Supervising District Attorney Investigator positions, and
deletes the vacant Assistant Chief of Investigations position. These changes greatly reduce the high
span of control for Investigator supervision that currently exists. The Supervising District Attorney
Investigator responsibilities include assisting in selecting, training, assigning, and evaluating staff. They
are part of the management team and participate in department wide analysis of District Attorney
functions; recommend changes to policies and procedures; and coordinate work with other divisions,
departments, and agencies.
Salaries and Benefits
 Salaries and Benefits recommended at $24,702,585 represent an 8% ($1,828,419) increase over
the current year adopted budget primarily due to full-year costs for positions added midyear FY 2013-
14, increases in retirement rates, promotions, and negotiated salary adjustments.
Recommended funding includes:
 Full-year costs for positions added midyear FY 2013-14.
 The addition of three Supervising District Attorney Investigator positions; the deletion of one
vacant Assistant Chief of Investigations position; and the deletion of two vacant Senior District
Attorney Investigator positions, resulting in the same level of staffing for the Investigator series.
 Account 6100 Regular Salaries reflect a 4% ($521,516) increase over the current year primarily
due to full-year costs for positions added midyear FY 2013-14, wage increases, and promotions.

on past claim history.

based on FY 2014-15 rates and costs associated with the replacement of high mileage vehicles.

Significant Program Changes
Based on changes to grant funding and program operations, a number of position changes are included
in the recommended budget as follows:
 Life and Annuity Fraud (Org 28628750) – The Deputy District Attorney position associated with this
program is being eliminated due to continued reductions in grant funding allocations.
 Indian Gaming (Org 28621000) – Based on estimated funding levels for FY 2014-15, the Office

The recommended NCC partially supports the programs of IHSS Fraud, Professional Standards and
Administration, URBAN, ID Theft, Mid-Level Drug Suppression, Waste Tire, and Victim Restitution.

Significant Program Changes
Felony and Misdemeanor Cases
In the first seven months of FY 2013-14, the department’s Felony Team experienced a 20% increase in
the number of new case assignments in comparison to the same period of the prior fiscal year. This is a
significant workload increase to the Felony Team that staff the seven felony home courts and two
Domestic Violence courts. Case assignment increases include new felony cases, Violation of Probation
cases, Parole cases, Post Release Community Supervision and Mandatory Supervision Release cases.
This increase is, in part, related to an overall increase in AB 109 realignment cases.
During the same period, the department’s Misdemeanor Team experienced a 15% increase in
misdemeanor cases and violations of probation in comparison to the same period last fiscal year. This is
a significant workload increase to the Misdemeanor Team staffing the five misdemeanor courts with one
attorney assigned per court.
The recommended budget includes the addition of 17 positions of which 7 positions are attorneys. The
two Defense Attorney II and five Defense Attorney I positions will assist with reducing significant delays
in the processing of court cases thereby improving efficiencies with system costs, jail overcrowding,
public safety, and the quality of legal services.
Forced Medication Cases - Petitions for Involuntary Medication
Effective July 1, 2012, Assembly Bill (AB) 366, Involuntary Medication Hearing legislation was enacted.
AB 366 allows the State to seek a court order authorizing the involuntary administration of antipsychotic
medication for a Mentally Disordered Offender (MDO) or a Sexually Violent Predator (SVP) committed to
a state mental hospital who refuses to take medication prescribed. The Attorney General represents the
Coalinga State Hospital in filing petitions for Involuntary Medication (CRAD). Coalinga State Hospital is
located in Fresno County which houses both MDO and SVP offenders who have court commitments
from other counties statewide. Since October 12, 2012 the Public Defender has accepted appointment
in all CRAD cases filed by Coalinga State Hospital, regardless of the originating county throughout the
State of California. To date, this exceeds 100 cases. For FY 2013-14, the Public Defender accepted
appointment on 56 new CRAD cases through April 2014. As of January 2014, CRAD cases began
trending upward with hearings often being calendared on a weekly basis. In order to address these
increased CRAD filings and to promote more efficient state reimbursement, the department devoted a
part-time extra-help attorney, beginning April 2014, to handle this caseload exclusively. The department
is able to submit claims to the state for full reimbursement of salaries, benefits, and indirect costs based
on 10% of salaries. The department submitted its most recent claim for reimbursement of services in
March 2014.
Student Internship Programs
During FY 2013-14, the department was included in a Board approved Agreement to formalize
partnerships with Alliant International University and California State University, Fresno for the use of
student interns to assist attorneys and paralegals in the preparation of criminal cases and assessments
of clients. The department plays a key role in building the local professional pool as student interns
receive practical training and experience in their field of expertise. Further, the department receives
invaluable assistance for necessary services to our clients.

divisional budget and designated for assigned Board Members to participate in the “One Voice”
Washington D.C. trip, California State Association of Counties (CSAC) conferences and
meetings, and other out-of-County travel expenses related to Board Member committee and

Significant Program Changes
On December 6, 2013, the Executive Board for the Interagency Council for Children and Families
(Council) voted to refocus its human capital and resources through other institutional means and
recommend that the Board discontinue the Council. On January 28, 2014, the Board of Supervisors
approved the dissolution of the Council. Since FY 2010-11, the CAO had provided a 0.5 full-time
equivalent staff member to act as the Interagency Coordinator. The dissolution of the Council resulted in
CAO staffing restructure.
Salaries and Benefits
 Salaries and Benefits recommended at $1,829,518 reflect an 11% ($176,853) increase over the
current year, due to the increase in Retirement Contributions, appointed Department Head and
Senior Management salary adjustments to address compaction. Staffing is recommended at 11
positions, which reflects no change from the current year.
Recommended funding includes:
 Account 6100 Regular Salaries recommended at $1,012,395 reflect an 8% ($75,295) increase
over the FY 2013-14 Adopted Budget due to adjustments to appointed Department Head and

increase over the FY 2013-14 Adopted Budget due to an increase in Regular Salaries and
Retirement Contribution rates.
Services and Supplies
 Services and Supplies recommended at $163,106 reflect a 23% ($30,869) increase over the FY
2013-14 Adopted Budget, primarily due to the increased cost of Professional and Specialized
Services as well as travel for SB 1022 and other County business.
Recommended funding includes:
 Account 7269 Printing recommended at $3,250 reflects a 111% ($1,712) increase over the FY

Services and Supplies
 Services and Supplies recommended at $3,813,149 represent a 9% ($301,842) increase over the FY
2013-14 Adopted Budget due to an increase in appropriations for maintenance/utility costs of vacant
spaces.
Recommended funding includes:
 Maintenance-Buildings and Grounds ($600,000) recommended at the same level as the FY
2013-14 Adopted Budget based on projected expenditures for emergency repairs. Due to the
Facilities Services Internal Service Fund (ISF) being relatively new and in order keep department
charges at a reasonable level, reserves for emergency repairs are currently not included in the
ISF. The ISD administers these activities.
 PeopleSoft Financial Charges ($3,062) reflect a 5% ($158) decrease from the FY 2013-14
Adopted Budget based on rates provided by ISD. The charges reflect the required share of the
ISD ISF costs for processing PeopleSoft transactions for Org 2540. ISD administers these
activities.
 Countywide Audit and Related Consulting Services ($175,000) recommended at the same level
as the FY 2013-14 Adopted Budget. Expenditures are for the annual independent audits
required by various Government (Govt.) Codes, U.S. Govt. Auditing Standards, the Single Audit
Act, and individual Federal/State grants. The audit is also necessary for the County’s bond rating
and is directly related to the cost of borrowing. Reimbursements in the amount of $17,760 are
expected to be received from third party payers to offset the audit costs related to their agencies.
The recommended funding also allows for other expert consulting services that may be needed
to complete financial statement disclosures. The ACTTC administers these activities.
 Financial Advisor Services ($120,000) recommended at the same level as the FY 2013-14
Adopted Budget. These services are needed for a financial consultant for the TRAN and other
debt financing. County staff does not have the resources or expertise in these matters. Also
includes the cost of printing and binding official statements as well as online bidding charges.
The ACTTC administers these activities.
 Armored Transport Services ($55,000) recommended at the same level as the FY 2013-14
Adopted Budget. Services are needed to safeguard cash transport activities. The costs are
100% reimbursed by user departments. The ACTTC administers these activities.
 Revenue Collection Services ($100,000) reflect a 9% ($10,000) decrease from the FY 2013-14
Adopted Budget to allow County departments to accept debit/credit card (Merchant Card)
payments and provide electronic check processing services. These services facilitate receipt of
revenues and enhance customer convenience. The costs are 100% reimbursed by user
departments. The ACTTC administers these activities.
 Government Finance Officers Association (GFOA) ($1,100) recommended at the same level as
the FY 2013-14 Adopted Budget for funding to obtain a GFOA - Certificate of Achievement, which
was established to encourage local governments to go beyond minimum requirements when
preparing comprehensive annual financial reports. Achieving the certificate enhances confidence
in the reported financial position of the County. The ACTTC administers this activity.
 Standard & Poor’s ($15,500) recommended at the same level as the FY 2013-14 Adopted
Budget for funding to obtain bond ratings, which are required in order to issue the County’s
annual Tax Revenue Anticipation Notes (TRAN). The ACTTC administers this activity.
 Sales Tax Recovery ($150,000) recommended at the same level as the FY 2013-14 Adopted
Budget for funding the recovery of sales tax revenues. Contracted services include analysis to
help ensure vendors properly report to the State all sales tax receipts applicable to the County.
Increased sales tax revenues fully offset the cost of the contract. The ACTTC administers these
activities.
 Trustee Fees ($11,000) recommended at the same level as the FY 2013-14 Adopted Budget for
funding used to pay the Bank of New York for administering the 2012 Lease Revenue Refunding
Bonds (LRRB), Juvenile Justice Court Facility and Offices Lease Revenue Bonds (LRBs) and
Pension Obligation Bonds (POB), as the County does not have the expertise or resources to
perform these services. The POB portion ($4,850) is 100% offset from rates charged to the
County departments to cover POB debt. The ACTTC administers these activities.
 Actuarial Fees ($2,000) reflect a 100% ($2,000) increase over the FY 2013-14 Adopted Budget
for the cost of contract actuarial services to amortize the County’s Net Pension Asset. In 2004,
the County contributed dollars to the Retirement System in excess of the annual required
contribution to help reduce the County’s Unfunded Pension Liability creating a Net Pension
Asset. To comply with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), the County is required
to amortize the Net Pension Asset using the discount rate used by the Retirement System in
calculating the current year Annual Required Contribution. When the discount rate is changed, it
becomes necessary to get an updated amortization schedule. The ACTTC administers these
activities.
 Bond Counsel ($84,700) recommended at the same level as the FY 2013-14 Adopted Budget for
services required from outside bond counsel. County Counsel does not have the expertise
regarding municipal finance matters (e.g. bond issuance), and investors expect to see a
nationally recognized law firm on the bond documents. County Counsel administers these
activities and incurs the bond counsel expenditures in County Counsel Org 0710. Upon request,
these expenditures are later reversed from Org 0710 and charged to Org 2540.
 State and Federal Legislative Advocacy Services ($162,012) remain at the same level as the FY
2013-14 Adopted Budget for contracted services with State ($88,008) and Federal ($74,004)
Legislative Advocates. This item provides lobbyist services to more effectively represent the
needs of the County on numerous issues at the State and Federal levels. The CAO administers
these activities.
 Annual Membership Dues for the Five Cities Economic Development Joint Powers Authority
(JPA) ($6,000) recommended at the same level as the FY 2013-14 Adopted Budget and
represents the projected cost for the County’s membership in the JPA. The JPA was established
to assist member agencies to develop local economic development resources, establish
cooperative relationships to pursue legislation, seek funding, plan the allocation of resources, and
implement the Regional Economic Development Program and strategies. The JPA now consists
of eight members including the cities of Fowler, Kingsburg, Orange Cove, Parlier, Reedley,
Sanger, and Selma as well as the County of Fresno. Membership dues are proportionate to each
member agency’s population. The CAO administers these activities.
 Driver Alliant Insurance Liability ($275) recommended at the same level as the FY 2013-14
Adopted Budget for the Retirement Board's insurance coverage. Government Code Section
7511 requires the County to pay for premiums related to the non-recourse clause of fiduciary
liability insurance for the Fresno County Employees’ Retirement Association (FCERA) Board and
Administrator. The Code prohibits a public retirement plan from paying this charge. The bill is
received from FCERA and processed by the CAO.
 Council of Governments (COG) Membership Dues ($15,500) recommended at the same level as
the FY 2013-14 Adopted Budget for annual membership dues that are required through the COG
Joint Powers Agreement (JPA). COG (a mandated State and Federal-designated Regional
Transportation and Metropolitan Planning agency) currently uses the dues for State and Federal
lobbying efforts which, therefore, cannot be funded from the Road Fund. Participation in the JPA
is necessary for the County to have a voice in regional decision-making and programming of
hundreds of millions of dollars in regional and local transportation funding. The CAO administers
this item.
 Appraisal Fees ($10,000) reflects a 100% ($10,000) increase over the FY 2013-14 Adopted
Budget for the cost of appraising County Property. In order for County property to be sold an
appraisal must be obtained. Funding will be used for the cost of obtaining appraisals as the
County looks to potentially sell vacant property. The CAO administers this item.
 Facility Operation and Maintenance for Vacant Spaces ($2,100,000) reflects a 17% ($300,000)
increase over the FY 2013-14 Adopted Budget based on updated actual and estimated costs of
utilities, and maintenance of vacant County building spaces including University Medical Center,
Elkhorn boot camp, and the 10th Street Juvenile Hall/Court facilities. These estimates could be
reduced or offset as a result of the Board's direction to consider the sale, lease, or increased use
of County properties. The costs do not benefit specific entities and therefore cannot be charged
to departments or grants. As such, the Facility Services ISF would not be able to recover
revenues for these costs so funding for this purpose needs to be absorbed by the General Fund
(Org 2540, account 7345). The ISD administers this activity.
 Transportation, Travel and Education ($2,000) recommended at the same level as the FY 2013-
14 Adopted Budget for travel costs needed in order to get Standard & Poor’s bond ratings
associated with TRAN borrowing. This expenditure account (7415) is also used to pay for
American Express Corporate Card travel expenditures. Charges are then reversed and charged
to applicable departments. This activity is primarily administered by the ACTTC.
 Public Safety Realignment Act (AB 109) Planning Grant ($200,000) recommended at the same
level as the FY 2013-14 Adopted Budget and is used to provide reimbursement for the planning
grant activities of various County departments. AB 109 Planning Grant funding fully offsets these
costs.
Other Charges
 Other Charges recommended at ($7,019,199) represent a 10% ($650,721) increase over the FY
2013-14 Adopted Budget due to the elimination of appropriations for the Property Tax Administrative
Fee (PTAF) methodology correction owed to cities and offset with the addition of appropriations for
the Proposition 42 MOE payment that is owed to the Road Fund on or before June 30, 2015.
Recommended funding includes:
 Fresno City/County Historical Society ($12,500) recommended at the same level as the FY 2013-
14 Adopted Budget and provides non-mandated funding for the operation of the Kearney
Mansion Museum complex and interior maintenance of the Kearney Mansion. The CAO
administers this activity. Additional funds are budgeted in Parks and Grounds Org 7910 of Public
Works & Planning (PW&P).
 415 Retirement Replacement Plan ($125,000) reflects a 9% ($10,000) increase over the FY
2013-14 Adopted Budget for payments to past County of Fresno employees who have retired
and have compensation above the IRS tax limit for retirement. The recommended funding, which
is required by IRS Code 415, is based on projected expenditures as provided by the ACTTC.
These costs are fully-offset by a reimbursement to Org 2540 which is made available from a like
reduction in the Retirement Contribution to FCERA. The ACTTC administers this activity.
 Amador Plan Fire Services ($894,048) recommended at a 2% ($15,841) increase over the FY
2013-14 Adopted Budget, based on the proposed agreement with CAL FIRE for FY 2014-15.
Similar to FY 2013-14, funding provides for non-mandated fire protection services during the nonfire
season (generally November through May) at four of five fire stations located in select foothill
and mountain areas including Piedra, Blasingame, Shaver Lake, and Squaw Valley. The Hurley
station will be funded by the Fresno County Fire Protection District. Payments under this
agreement are based on actual costs, which are contingent on the length of the fire season. The
agreement with CAL FIRE is presented to the Board during the fiscal year for retroactive
approval. The CAO administers these activities.
 Cash Shortages ($4,000) recommended at a 60% ($1,500) increase over the FY 2013-14
Adopted Budget based on actual and projected expenditures. Consistent with Management
Directive 740, cash shortage reimbursements to County departments have been budgeted in Org
2540. Shortages are recommended for approval if there is no proof of fraud or gross negligence
and the loss is not covered by insurance. The ACTTC administers these activities.

Tax Revenue Anticipation Notes (TRAN) (Account 7867)
 For the past 36 years, the Board of Supervisors has authorized a short-term borrowing program
through a TRAN issuance. The TRAN issuance enables the County to maintain a positive cash flow
until anticipated taxes and revenues are received throughout the fiscal year.
The recommended funding of $2,700,000 for FY 2014-15 is based on an assumed $90,000,000 debt
issuance at a 3% interest rate. This represents the same level of funding as recommended for FY
2013-14. If the final debt issuance amount and interest rate for FY 2014-15 result in a debt
requirement that is significantly less than what is budgeted, any savings would be available for reappropriation
as approved by the Board.
Upon receipt, TRAN proceeds are deposited into an interest bearing account. Funding for the
interest payment is transferred from the Interest and Miscellaneous Expenditures budget, where it is
budgeted as net County cost.
Other Information
Pension Obligation Bonds (POB)
 Fresno County has issued POB on three occasions. In March 1998, Fresno County issued
$184,910,000 of taxable POB with a 10-year amortization to fund the Unfunded Actuarial Accrued
Liability (UAAL) of the Fresno County Employee’s Retirement Association. In March 2002, these
bonds were partially refunded in order to extend the debt servicing of the bonds to an 18-year
amortization period to provide budget relief. In addition, in 2004, a total of $327,897,749 in fixed rate
bonds were issued with a 30-year amortization, and a total of $75 million in variable rate bonds were
issued. The $75 million variable rate bonds were converted to fixed rate bonds on September 12,
2006 at a fixed rate of 5.56%. The maturity schedule of the converted bonds remained the same. In
FY 2008-09, the debt service for the 1998 POBs was completed. A total of $39,559,272 in debt
service payments is required in FY 2014-15, which includes all administration fees associated with
the bonds. See debt service schedule and remaining maturity for all three issuances following this
narrative.

Remaining Payment Period ..........................................................Varied
2014-15 Debt Service Payment ....................................................$39,559,272
Amounts necessary to timely pay the POB debt service payments have been incorporated into the
County’s FY 2014-15 retirement rates and are collected from departments each pay period.


Contingencies
 Contingencies are recommended at $700,000, which represent a 7% ($50,000) decrease from the
FY 2013-14 Adopted Budget of $750,000. On November 12, 2013, $842 was transferred to the
Interest & Miscellaneous Expenditures Org 2540, to fund an increase in the maximum agreement
amount for the County’s Amador Plan agreement with the California Department of Forestry and Fire
Protection (CalFire). On April 22, 2014, the Department of Social Services transferred $2,525,774 to
Contingencies as a result of an increase in Realignment revenue. At the end of the fiscal year
unused appropriations for Contingencies will fall to fund balance and are included in the funding of
the FY 2014-15 Recommended Budget. After budget adoption, during the fiscal year Contingencies
require a 4/5th vote to access funding.
General Reserves
 A $2,043,453 contribution to the General Reserves is recommended for FY 2014-15. The FY
2014-15 General Reserve contribution represents 0.75% of the total FY 2014-15 Countywide
Revenues amount of $274.6 million. With this contribution, the General Reserve balance will
increase to $16,486,457 to address potential future liabilities. The General Reserve, except in cases
of a legally declared emergency may only be decreased at the time of adopting the budget. The
general reserve may be increased any time during the fiscal year by a 4/5th vote.
Designations
 Three designations have been included in the FY 2014-15 Recommended Budget in the amount of
$22,762,003. Designations require a 4/5th vote to access funding.
Pension Obligation Bond Third Party Payer
 A designation in the amount of $8,957,503 has been reserved to address the potential disallowance
of Pension Obligation Bond (POB) costs claimed to third party funding sources, such as federal
grants, for a portion of the refinanced pension obligation bonds. Principles governing federal cost
reimbursements are set out in the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-87 (A-87).
OMB A-87 treats pension plan costs as fringe benefits that are allowable to be claimed, including
Pension Obligation Bonds. In March of 1998, the County issued Pension Obligation Bonds in the
amount of $184,910,000 to cover the Unfunded Actuarial Accrued Liability (UAAL). Due to the State
of California’s economy and stagnant growth in Countywide revenues, the County issued Taxable
Pension Obligation Bonds, 2002 Refunding Series. Approximately $117,000,000 of the 1998 POBs
were refunded. By refunding the bonds, the County was able to reduce its annual debt service and
extend its debt service schedule out 10 years, but in doing so, the County incurred an additional $77
million in debt service payments. At the time of the 2002 POB issuance, the County of Fresno was
not aware of the potential for future denial of claims, as correspondence from the Federal
Department of Health and Human Services, regarding issuance guidelines relative to allowable costs
on refunding POB that increase the total debt service was not circulated to the County until February
of 2003. To date, no federal claims have been denied reimbursement for reasons concerning
claiming POB costs. It is estimated that the potential cost of the disallowance is $50 million in total
and $8,957,503 for FY 2014-15. The County and their advisors have attempted to resolve this issue
with the State Controller’s Office, but the County has been instructed that no action can be taken until
such time that a claim for reimbursement for the additional POB costs is disallowed. It is the County’s
intent to fully appeal any and all amounts disallowed through the Federal Government’s
administrative appeals process.
Sheriff Staffing Needs
 A designation in the amount of $5,950,000 has been reserved to address potential staffing needs in
the Fresno County Jail. The County of Fresno is currently involved in the first stage of an agreed
upon settlement process, from a complaint that was filed by current or former inmates of the County
jail concerning various conditions at the County jail. The first stage of the settlement process
involves inspections made by jointly-retained experts concerning various aspects of the County jail
operations, including staffing and the potential need for an increase in staffing levels.
Budget Mitigation
 A designation in the amount of $7,854,500 has been reserved for County budget mitigation. This
represents the amount of funding available for the Board in making adjustments in budget hearings,
to mitigate potential impacts in the FY 2014-15 State Budget or during the fiscal year.
FY 2013-14 Designations
 The FY 2013-14 Adopted Budget included two designations totaling $16,640,800.
 A designation in the amount of $5,569,392 was reserved for the payment of the Proposition
(Prop) 42 Maintenance-of-Effort (MOE) that is due to the Road Fund by June 30, 2015. On July
9, 2013, the Board authorized the use of $3,011,040 from the Prop 42 MOE designation to be
transferred to the Coalinga Disposal Site (CDS) Org 9028 to partially fund the CDS closure
construction. The balance of the designation $2,558,352 will be recommended for release to
fund balance and included in the FY 2014-15 Recommended Budget.
 A designation in the amount of $11,071,408 was reserved for Budget Mitigation to address
pending liabilities that could occur during FY 2013-14. On October 29, 2013, $2,000,000 was
transferred to the Capital Projects Org 1910 to fund projects to update and improve the South
Annex Jail. Additionally on October 29, 2013, $1,000,000 was transferred to the Capital Projects
Org 1910 to fund modifications at the Fresno County Adult Detention Facilities. On February 4,
2014, $706,882 was transferred to the Interest and Miscellaneous Expenditures Org 2540 for the
payment of Property Tax Administrative Fee (PTAF) refunds. Budget mitigation funds in the
amount of $422,430 will be requested prior to budget hearings to fund expenses that were part of
the Fresno County Regional Forensic Center, but are not eligible to use Tobacco Securitization
Bond Funds (Tobacco Funds). Since expenses have already been incurred, to remain in
compliance, net County cost funding is required to off-set the expenses.
 The remaining $6,942,096 in the FY 2013-14 Budget mitigation designation will be included in the
FY 2014-15 Recommended Budget as fund balance.

Street location, the department has opened up two lobby areas to allow for the separation of the public
counters serving Clerk Services (marriages, fictitious business names, passports, notary) and Elections
(voter services, candidate filing, campaign filing, data requests). This shift in operations is aimed at
reducing overcrowding in the lobby area, shortening the wait time for services and improving the

Significant Program Changes
The ISD consists of numerous budget units that were formerly stand-alone departments or subdepartments
of either the ITSD or the General Services Department. As the consolidations were done,
some functions were brought into the current structure and others remained distributed. Due to the
remaining distributed functions, there are further opportunities for economies of scale. The proposed
budget strives to remediate the majority of those remaining organizational anomalies.
As part of the continuing consolidation of the two departments, it is recommended that staffing in the
administrative section be restructured. This will involve adding three positions to focus on the nontechnical
aspects of the department allowing technically trained staff currently performing administrative
functions to move back to contributing technical and programming support for user departments. This
will allow the Department to reduce the backlog of support requests and accomplish administrative tasks
at a lower overhead cost. All changes proposed in the budget conform to the rate development structure
for both revenue and expenses.

current year. This is due to the increase in overall salaries and recommended additional

Significant Program Changes
This budget reflects significant changes in both delivery of care and funding for the MISP. In previous
years, all MISP services were contracted with Community Regional Medical Centers (CRMC). Due to a
shift in patients from MISP to Medi-Cal and significantly reduced Health Realignment revenues under AB
85, this budget reflects continuation of the current comprehensive contract with CRMC for MISP and
inmate medical care for only one quarter. While negotiations with the State are still in process and no
final decisions have been made for the remainder of the year, the department may contract medical
services for the remaining MISP population. Inmate medical care is planned to be included through a
provider contract budgeted in Org 5620 – Public Health.
Additionally, MISP services have traditionally been funded with Health Realignment with no NCC
contribution. This budget reflects a shift in funding for MISP services, which includes Health
Realignment ($7,233,368) and funds from a 10% transfer of Mental Health Realignment ($3,397,121).
The anticipated cost of treating the residual population was estimated based on prior utilization and
scope of services provided. In the event the actual utilization of services exceeds estimates, additional
funding may be required.
Services and Supplies
 Services and Supplies recommended at $10,630,489 represent a 50% ($10,819,700) decrease from
the current year primarily due to an accounting shift of indigent and in-custody healthcare costs being
budgeted in Org 5620 – Public Health after including only one quarter of expenditures in this Org.
Recommended funding includes:
 Account 7295 Professional and Specialized Services represent a 50% ($10,819,700) decrease
from the current year due to indigent and in-custody patient healthcare costs being included in
this budget for only one quarter. Appropriations included only fund the CRMC Agreement for one
quarter, through September 30, 2014, until future plans are finalized.
Other Financing Uses
 Other Financing Uses recommended at $47,845,534 represent a 5% ($2,220,780) increase over
current year due to an increase in estimated VLF Realignment revenues.
Recommended funding includes:
 Account 7904 Operating Transfers Out represents a 5% ($2,220,780) increase over current year
due to an increase in estimate VLF Realignment revenues, which must pass through this Org.
 This account includes the mandated County local match ($11,359,752) to qualify Fresno County
for Local Health and Welfare Realignment sales tax revenue, which consists of $10,404,113 for
the Health Account and $955,639 for the Mental Health Account. This is the County’s fixed MOE
requirement that is specified in Welfare and Institutions Code §17608.010. This requirement is a
condition for the deposit of sales tax into the County’s Local Health and Welfare Trust Fund
account.
 By meeting the MOE, the County is eligible to receive VLF Realignment revenues, for specific
purposes, which consists of Health VLF revenues ($24,108,530) and Social Services VLF
revenues ($1,746,324) equivalent to the FY 2013-14 estimated Realignment VLF revenues;
estimated VLF Collection Account revenues ($727,543); and CalWORKs MOE revenues
($9,903,385). These funds are appropriated in this budget and transferred to the H&WTF Budget
(Org 5243).


Significant Program Changes
The budget includes a variety of significant fiscal effects related to Patient Protection and Affordable
Care Act (ACA) implementation. Changes related to ACA result in both costs and savings. The ACA
resulted in new eligibility and entitlements beginning January 1, 2014. The ACA includes expanded
Medi-Cal coverage to adults solely based on an income under 138% of the Federal Poverty Level. The
ACA also includes enhanced mental health and substance use disorder services for both newly eligible
and previously eligible Medi-Cal beneficiaries. As a result, many indigent adults receiving care became
eligible for Medi-Cal, shifting the cost of services from Mental Health Realignment to Federal
reimbursement.
A 10% ($3,397,121) transfer of 1991 Realignment revenue from Mental Health to the Health account was
approved by the Board of Supervisors on April 29, 2014, due to reductions in Health Realignment
revenue. This continues the 10% shift which was approved for FY 2013-14 with the Board making the
determination that it was the most cost effective use of available resources to maximize client outcomes.
The department has identified Mental Health Realignment savings made available by enhanced federal
revenues through ACA implementation, which shifts a portion of the indigent population previously being
served to Medi-Cal eligibility effective January 1, 2014.
The “Katie A.” class action lawsuit against the State of California was settled on December 1, 2011,
which requires counties to provide an integrated service delivery model with the Department of Social
Services-Child Welfare (DSS-CW) to ensure children and families in the child welfare system are
screened, referred and receive mental health treatment services. The department provided MHSA
funding allocated for the Team Decision Making program and 2011 EPSDT Realignment to add eight
clinical and support positions in FY 2013-14 that will be co-located at DSS to coordinate mental health
referral and treatment services; performed data matching between DBH and DSS-CW information
systems and community stakeholder presentations and input. The departments collaborated on a
competitive bid process to select vendors to align mental health services with the requirements of Katie
A. and in alignment with the California Partners for Permanency program model. Services are
anticipated to begin in July 2014.
In an effort to improve health and mental health services to juveniles and adults at County detention
facilities, the Department of Public Health and Sheriff’s Office initiated a competitive bid process for jail
medical services. In collaboration with the departments, a competitive bid process was completed to
select a vendor to provide medical and behavioral health services at juvenile and adult detention
facilities. This plan for outsourcing of services to Corizon Health, Inc. is scheduled to begin July 1, 2014.
In January 2014, the department submitted an SB 82 Investment in Mental Health Wellness Act of 2013
grant application to create an expanded crisis response system for Fresno County Recovery Center.
The department has received a preliminary award of $794,795 for an eight-bed expansion of the Exodus
Adult Crisis Stabilization unit and creation of an eight-bed Youth Crisis Stabilization unit (CSU) on the
Kings Canyon campus. The Youth CSU development would involve the closure of the existing Children’s
Crisis Assessment Intervention and Resolution program (CCAIR) and the opening, on the main campus,
of a State licensed children’s CSU. Should Fresno County receive final award approval, the department
will return to the Board for direction. With Board approval, both programs would be anticipated to begin
during FY 2014-15.

detention facility services being contracted, expansion of adult and youth crisis stabilization, as well
as additional costs related to Memoranda of Understanding with the local Managed Care Plan and
increased MHSA program implementation costs.

Significant Program Changes
On October 1, 2013, the department began implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) legislation,
including changes and expansion to the existing Medi-Cal program. The State estimated that 56,000
individuals would be eligible for expanded Medi-Cal and an additional 65,000 would be eligible for
subsidized insurance through the Covered California Health Exchange. While the County’s primary
responsibility is for the Medi-Cal program expansion, the County Social Services offices also serve as a
single point of entry for all other health insurance applications. During the current year, the department
worked with the State and the community to expand the application channels available to County
residents for obtaining health care insurance. Your Board approved the addition of 132 positions aimed
at implementation of ACA. During the initial phase of program implementation, the department was
required to utilize a new statewide system, the California Healthcare Eligibility, Enrollment and Retention
System (CalHEERS), for ACA related applications. During the initial 5 months of enrollment, DSS
assisted 30,319 individuals in applying for Medi-Cal and subsidized insurance programs. Once a viable
information system interface was implemented, department staff began transitioning 25,420 individuals
from CalHEERs to CalWORKs Information Network (CalWIN). In addition, the department implemented
the ACA related express lane eligibility program, along with a number of other legislative and State policy
changes that clarified how California would implement Federal ACA legislation. A number of system and
program changes are pending with the State which will impact the implementation of the ACA in Fresno
County.
The department implemented the DSS Service Center (Service Center) for the CalFresh and Medi-Cal
programs in FY 2012-13 and continues to evaluate and make continuous improvements to this model
through the current year. The Service Center represents a significant change in business processes as
a Client Needs Based/Task Management business model with a “no wrong door” policy, where clients
can access services through multiple channels, including Service Center locations, through web-based
applications (Benefits CalWIN) and through the department’s Call Center. Under the new model, the
department transitioned from “one worker/one case” case management model to task-based
management, where intake and ongoing case maintenance eligibility functions are converted into tasks
and equitably distributed among workers. The Service Center is focused on improving customer service,
leveraging new or improved technology, increasing quality assurance, and improving business
efficiencies to assist the department in addressing future change.
The department’s plan to implement contracted court-ordered Child Welfare mental health services in the
current year were delayed due to unanticipated issues which are still under review between the DSS and
the Department of Behavioral Health (DBH). The funding for these services reflects a combination of
Mental Health Medi-Cal Federal Financial Participation, Mental Health Realignment and Child Welfare
Funding. DSS and DBH are working to ensure that all budgetary and accounting requirements are met.
The recommended budget includes a 43% ($3,932,314) decrease in revenues to reflect the continued
delay in program start-up.
Salaries and Benefits
 Salaries and Benefits recommended at $188,840,825 represent an 8% ($13,500,929) increase over
the current year adopted budget primarily due to the cost of 132 positions that were added in
November 2013 to implement ACA. The increase also includes updated Retirement Contribution
rates, projected cost of Overtime for upcoming projects related to ACA, WINS, Express Eligibility and
the ongoing DSS Service Center implementation. Staffing is recommended at 2,457 positions,
reflecting a net increase of 5 positions over the current year level.
Recommended funding includes:
 Account 6100 Regular Salaries represents a 5% ($4,403,656) increase over FY 2013-14 Adopted
Budget, due to the cost of 132 positions that were added in the current year. The recommended
budget also includes the addition of two Substance Abuse specialists positions (SAS) for Child
Welfare Services in order to address new Katie A. court mandates and two Program Technician –
Confidential positions to handle the increased workload associated with department personnel
functions and Medi-Cal Eligibility Determination System (MEDS) Security compliance activities.
In addition, four Social Service Program Supervisor positions (SSPS) are recommended for the
CalWORKs WTW program in order to reinstate SSPS positions that were deleted or transferred
to supervise new eligibility positions added for other programs in FY 2011-12. Instead of
requesting the full complement of SSPS positions needed at the time, WTW SSPS positions
were shifted to cover the new staff and functions in other programs. The reduction of four WTW
SSPS positions and hiring controls implemented in the WTW program in FY 2011-12 and FY
2012-13 allowed the department to mitigate funding reductions in this program. In FY 2013-14,
the State implemented SB 1041 with a number of reforms in the WTW program that included reengagement
of CalWORKs clients who were previously exempt from the WTW participation; new
requirements for the counties related to assessments; and implementation of the WTW 24 month
time clock that impacts the activities required for those eligible to receive services, such as client
monitoring. To implement the new regulation, Fresno County’s CalWORKs WTW allocation was
increased by $4,550,000. As a result of the various programmatic changes, WTW program has
seen a 30% increase in participants, which has necessitated easing hiring controls for WTW job
specialist positions. The recommended restoration of the SSPS positions will ensure that
adequate span of control and staff coverage is available in the WTW program as positions are
filled and full requirements of SB 1041 are implemented.
 Account 6200 Extra-Help represents a 61% ($222,603) decrease from the current year based on
updated projections of program needs. Extra-help is still necessary to provide staffing support
during the fiscal year due to a variety of temporary program needs.
 Account 6300 Overtime represents a 40% ($1,196,754) increase over the current year adopted
budget due to the overtime cost of implementation of ACA and the DSS Service Center and
projected workload impact of upcoming State mandated changes associated with CalFresh and
Medi-Cal, including Express Lane Eligibility mandates and activities to comply with State Work
Incentive Nutritional Supplement (WINS) implementation. Overtime is necessary because of
anticipated albeit temporary workload surges as a result of continued implementation of the ACA
and changes to State mandated programs. Current year appropriations in this account were
increased midyear through a budget transfer from account 6100, Regular Salaries. Due to the
normal lag in filling ACA positions, the increase in applications due to ACA, State implementation
issues with the CalHEERS system, and new mandates, the department experienced higher than
anticipated overtime utilization. The recommended appropriations for FY 2014-15 reflect a lower
amount than the projected actual expenditures in the current year.
 Account 6350 Unemployment Insurance represents a 45% ($80,517) decrease from the current
year based on the actual department claim calculation provided by Risk Management.
 Account 6400 Retirement Contribution represents a 12% ($6,036,501) increase over the current
year based on the updated Retirement Contribution rates and full-year retirement benefit costs
for 132 positions that were added in the current year.
 Account 6500 OASDI reflects a 5% ($410,668) increase based on the addition of 132 positions in
the current year, plus an additional 5 positions in FY 2014-15.
 Account 6550 Workers’ Compensation Contribution reflects an 8% ($225,053) increase based on
actual experience.
 Account 6600 Health Insurance Contribution represents an 11% ($1,531,377) increase due to an
increase in participation.
 Salary savings is recommended at 7.5% ($8,087,253) to account for normal recruitment
timeframes, unpaid leave of absences, and savings associated with employee turnover.
Services and Supplies
 Services and Supplies recommended at $59,046,500 represent a 5% ($2,796,154) decrease from
the current year adopted budget primarily due to a change in the budgeting account used for 21
direct client services contracts from Professional & Specialized Services, account 7295 to Other
Charges, account 7870. Account 7870 is used primarily for this purpose.
Recommended funding includes:
 Account 7040 Telephone Charges reflect a 23% ($231,843) increase due to the connectivity cost
of positions added in the current year and charges associated with operating an Integrated Voice
Response (IVR) System as part of the DSS Service Center Call Center functions.
 Account 7295 Professional & Specialized Services reflect a 24% ($4,051,348) decrease. The
reduction is mainly attributed to 21 contracts that were previously budgeted in account 7295
which are now included in the recommended budget under Other Charges, account 7870
($3,938,072). The services provided by these agreements are considered direct client services.
 Account 7296 Data Processing Services reflect a 16% ($1,321,155) increase based on estimated
PC leases, connectivity, info storage, and Microsoft Enterprise License costs associated with 132
positions that were added in the current year. The recommended increase also includes
projected application labor and IT support costs associated with all system changes related to
ACA implementation and other State mandated changes.
 Account 7611 Security Services reflect a 14% ($255,228) decrease based on a significant
reduction in the rates charged by the Internal Services Department (ISD), General Services
division.
Other Charges
 Other Charges recommended at $43,110,670 represent a 9% ($3,390,323) increase over the current
year adopted budget.
Recommended funding includes:
 An accounting procedure correction resulted in 21 contracts, a total of $3,938,072 previously
budgeted in account 7295, Professional & Specialized Services, which are now budgeted in
account 7870, as the service providers are in direct contact with the clients.
 Funding of $1,100,000 to fund the implementation of the CalWORKs Expanded Subsidized
Employment (ESE) program, which places CalWORKs recipients and other eligible participants
with qualified employers.
Residual Equity Transfer Out - Fleet
 Residual Equity Transfers recommended at $563,300 represent costs associated with replacement of
vehicles that have reached useful life and are recommended by the Internal Services Department for
replacement in the Child Welfare Services program.
(19) Automobiles ................$470,011 ............................ Replacement
(4) Vans............................... $93,289............................. Replacement



Other Charges
 Recommended funding of $30,643,005 represents an 8% ($2,157,055) increase over the current
year adopted budget based on current year caseloads and average grant projections. The average
caseload includes 21 cases currently participating in the SB 163 Wraparound program in lieu of
group home placement.
 The budgeted Aid to Adoptions recommended budget compared to FY 2013-14 Adopted Budget
caseload reflects 1.4% (38) caseload growth over the current year’s projected cases of 2,639 per
month to 2,677 cases per month in FY 2014-15 based on current caseload trends. The
recommended budget also includes the estimated impact of the 2.98% California Necessities Index
(CNI) increase to the average grant, which accounts for $886,638 in increased cost for FY 2014-15.
Recommended funding includes:
 Federal Aid to Adoptions cases budgeted at $27,042,655 reflect an increase of $1,790,004 for a
monthly average of 2,355 cases at a rounded average grant of $957.
 Non-Federal Aid to Adoptions cases budgeted at $3,582,599 reflect an increase of $382,248 for
a monthly average of 320 cases at a rounded average grant of $932.
 Estimated grant repayments are in the amount of $17,750. These costs are incurred by the
department; and therefore, funds are budgeted in the recommended appropriations, but are
reduced from the total cost claimed under Federal and Non-Federal Aid to Adoptions cases.


Significant Program Changes
The Earned Income Disregard (EID) used in the grant calculation for CalWORKs recipients is up to the
first $225 of earned income per month. Effective October 1, 2013, the first $225 per month of initial
earned income and 50% of any remaining earned income will be disregarded from the grant calculation.
On average, an estimated 220 cases in FY 2014-15 will remain eligible each month instead of being
discontinued as a result of earnings over the eligibility limit. The estimated annual cost of this change is
$147,840 for FY 2014-15.
On March 1, 2014, Assembly Bill (AB) 85 increased the Maximum Aid Payment (MAP) by 5% for all
cases increasing the average monthly grant from $456 to $478. The estimated annual increase in
assistance payments is $7,852,355 and will be fully covered by the State. Under AB 85, the additional
assistance payment costs were to be cost neutral to counties; as such, the State based changes to the
monthly assistance expenditure claims to implement this provision.
Senate Bill (SB) 1041 created new time limitations on the Employment Services Welfare-to-Work (WTW)
24-Month Time Clock, and alignment of CalWORKs hourly work requirements to Federal participation
requirements with changes to certain WTW exemptions. These changes were effective January 1, 2013.
It is anticipated that the WTW 24-Month Clock limitation will have an impact on costs beginning on
January 1, 2015 which are included in budgeted appropriations.
Other Charges
 Recommended appropriations of $167,517,012 represent a 7% ($10,510,435) increase over the FY
2013-14 Adopted Budget based on caseload and average grant projections.
Recommended funding includes:
 The recommended budget caseload reflects a 1% (348 cases) increase over the current year
with a monthly average of 29,120 cases. An average grant of $478 per month is projected for the
budget year.


Other Charges
 Recommended funding of $36,000 reflects a 7% ($2,736) decrease from the current year based on
caseload and average grant projections. The recommended RCA caseload reflects a 17% decrease
from 12 cases in FY 2013-14 to 10 cases in FY 2014-15.
Recommended funding includes:
 $36,000, which reflects a decrease of ($2,736) to finance a monthly average of 10 cases per
month with an average grant of $300.


Significant Program Changes
On September 30, 2010, Assembly Bill (AB) 12 passed and authorized several changes to Foster Care
and Kin-GAP, including increasing the child age limit eligibility from 19 years to 20 years beginning
January 2013; and from 20 years to 21 years beginning January 2014. Prior to the AB 12 Extended
Foster Care (EFC) program, the courts could order foster care for a child over 18 and the County would
be required to issue 100% County funds for the placement of the child. EFC added two years of
eligibility for qualifying children and provided offsetting funding for federal-eligible cases. Participation in
EFC is voluntary for the youth, and youth can exit and enter the program at any time prior to their
eligibility expiring. The FY 2014-15 Recommended Budget includes an estimated 290 cases per month
in EFC, based on the current year trend.
Other Charges
 Recommended funding of $51,591,346 represents a 15% ($6,601,159) increase over the current
year adopted budget based on actual caseload and average placement cost trends.

based a monthly average of 1,716 minor (0-18 years old) cases and 290 EFC (19–21 years old)
cases at an average grant of $1,845 and $1,405, respectively. Recommended funding includes
an estimated increase to foster home and group home rates of 2.98% based on the State
estimate of the CNI rate for FY 2014-15.
 Kin-GAP cases budgeted at $4,271,928, an increase of $36,559, for a monthly average of 467
cases at an average grant of $762. Recommended funding includes an estimated rate increase
to Federal and Non-Federal Kin-GAP rates of 2.98% based on the State’s estimate of the CNI
rate.

Significant Program Changes
On September 26, 2013, the Governor signed Assembly Bill (AB) 101 into law, which provides an
additional one-time $3,000,000 in funding for all California counties participating in the County
Subvention program. Fresno County’s award amount was $34,144. The increased one-time funding is
intended to increase the number of veterans linked to various services. The CDVA recommends that all
counties implement a Veteran Identification Card System for tracking increased office visits and service
referrals. Counties currently using this system have shown a 20% increase in office traffic. To help
address this anticipated increase, the department plans to fund extra-help staff with the specialized
funding. Net County cost reflects a 48% ($57,906) increase over current year, due to the addition of a
Veterans Services Representative to address increased veterans’ service needs.
Salaries and Benefits
 Salaries and Benefits recommended at $482,027 represent a 22% ($86,097) increase over the
current year due to the addition of one position, promotions, salary step increases, associated benefit
increases, as well as budgeted extra-help. Staffing is recommended at six positions.
Recommended funding includes:
 Account 6200 Extra-Help represents a 100% ($10,463) increase based on estimated
expenditures for one extra-help staff for a one-time project and subvention funding authorized
through the CDVA for linking increased numbers of veterans to additional services and
implementation of the identification card services.
 Account 6350 Unemployment Insurance represents a 34% ($39) decrease based on Risk
Management rates determined by actual experience.

rate, increased compensable salaries, and the addition of one position.
 Account 6500 OASDI Contribution includes a 22% ($3,643) increase based on projected Regular
Salaries.
 Account 6550 Workers’ Compensation Contribution includes a 30% ($148) increase based on
Risk Management rates determined by actual experience.
 Account 6600 Health Insurance Contribution includes a 19% ($7,123) increase based on
employer contribution rates and projected staff enrollment.
 Account 6670 Administrative Benefits Contribution includes a 5% ($33) increase based on fewer
employees participating in the Health Insurance program.
Services and Supplies
 Services and Supplies recommended at $128,187 represent a 2% ($2,415) increase over the current
year.
Recommended funding includes:
 Account 7040 Telephone Charges represent an 8% ($96) decrease based on updated rates and
actual utilization.
 Account 7101 Liability Risk represents a 9% ($1,041) increase based on Risk Management rates
determined by actual experience.
 Account 7265 Office Expense represents a 47% ($2,000) increase based on current year actuals
and supply costs associated with printing identification badges for veterans.
 Account 7268 Postage represents a 2% ($64) increase based on current year actuals and a
current postage rate increase.


Significant Program Changes
Effective July 1, 2012, the State implemented a MOE for the IHSS program. Prior to the IHSS MOE, the
County share-of-cost for IHSS was determined through statutory sharing ratios and the County was
responsible for approximately 17.6% of the total cost of the IHSS program. Under the MOE, the County
share-of-cost became a set amount that was equal to the actual County share-of-cost incurred by each
County for FY 2011-12. The County must pay that set amount regardless of the actual IHSS program
expenditures. Through the IHSS MOE, the County will not be financially impacted by any caseload
increases; however, the County will also not realize any financial savings resulting from caseload
decreases. Based on current statute, the IHSS MOE can be increased by the State for the following
reasons: 1) County negotiated wage and/or benefits increases; and 2) an annual inflation factor of 3.5%
effective July 1st of each fiscal year with the exception of years where there is ‘negative growth’ in 1991
Realignment. Based on this statute, a $788,147 increase in the MOE will be in effect July 1, 2014 and is
included in the recommended budget.
In March 2013, the State, IHSS beneficiaries, and labor organizations reached a settlement resolving
major legal actions against State imposed reductions to the IHSS program. Under the terms of the
settlement, the State will no longer pursue either 1) a reduction in its financial participation in wages and
benefits; or 2) a 20% across the board reduction in IHSS hours. In exchange, the State will extend a
3.6% reduction in hours, which was scheduled to sunset on July 1, 2013, through June 30, 2014. An
additional 4.4% reduction was combined with the existing 3.6% reduction, bringing the total reduction in
hours to 8% for FY 2013-14. Under the terms of the settlement, the State will also restore 1% of the
reduction in hours beginning July 1, 2014, reducing the total hour reduction from 8% to 7% for FY 2014-
15. The 7% reduction was utilized in calculating the recommended appropriations. However, as the
County share-of-cost for the IHSS program is a MOE, the total increase in costs associated with the 1%
increase in hours will be revenue offset by the State.
Other Charges
 Recommended funding of $40,361,070 reflects a 7% ($2,703,499) increase over the FY 2013-14
Adopted Budget based on projected monthly benefits costs paid and the adjusted IHSS MOE.
Recommended funding includes:
 In-Home Supportive Services MOE for FY 2014-15 of $27,256,630, based on prior year plus
inflation at 3.5%.
 Provider health benefits of $13,104,441 based on the benefit rate of $0.85 per hour and a
projected 1,284,749 average paid hours per month for FY 2014-15.
 Paid hours will be affected by the additional hours available in January 2015 to recipients for wait
time that is associated with medical accompaniment. The State estimates that 85% of recipients
will require three hours per month. The recommended appropriations account for this impact.


Significant Program Changes
Effective July 1, 2012, the State implemented a Maintenance-of-Effort (MOE) for the IHSS program,
which includes the Public Authority. Prior to the IHSS MOE, the County share-of-cost for the Public
Authority was determined through statutory sharing ratios and the County was responsible for
approximately 17.6% of the total cost. Under the MOE, the County share-of-cost became a set amount
that was equal to the actual County share-of-cost incurred by each County for FY 2011-12. The County
must pay that set amount regardless of the actual Public Authority expenditures. Through the IHSS
MOE, the County will not be financially impacted by any expenditure increases; however, the County will
also not realize any financial savings resulting from expenditure decreases. The FY 2014-15 IHSS MOE
recommended appropriation of $132,777 reflects a 3.5% ($4,490) increase over the FY 2013-14 Adopted
Budget. The IHSS MOE is subject to an annual 3.5% increase every year hereafter, with the exception
of years where there is ‘negative growth’ in 1991 Realignment. The FY 2014-15 Recommended Budget
reflects the Public Authority MOE amount for FY 2014-15, including the 3.5% increase. Any costs
incurred above the MOE will be covered by the State General Fund.
Salaries and Benefits
 Salaries and Benefits recommended at $508,483 represent a 4% ($22,129) decrease from the
current year due to staffing turnover resulting in lower pay level staff. Total staffing is recommended
at seven positions and represents no change from current year.
Recommended funding includes:
 Account 6100 Regular Salaries includes full-year funding for seven positions; promotions, normal
step increases, and bilingual skills pay. Regular Salaries reflects a 5% decrease ($14,697) from
the current year adopted budget, based on three staff members with lower pay levels than are
reflected in the current year budget.
 Account 6350 Unemployment Insurance reflects a 26% ($228) decrease based on actual
experience.
 Account 6400 Retirement Contributions reflect a 2% ($3,455) increase based on net changes in
salary costs and the increased retirement rate.
 Account 6500 OASDI Contribution reflects a 5% ($1,125) decrease based on actual OASDI rates
applied to projected lower regular salary costs.
 Account 6550 Workers’ Compensation Contribution reflects a 23% ($8,098) decrease based on
actual experience.
 Account 6670 Administrative Benefits reflect an 8% ($68) decrease based on a change in the
level of participation in the health insurance program.
 Salary Savings are not included due to the small size of the department and minimal staffing with
seven positions.
Services and Supplies
 Services and Supplies recommended at $795,748 represent a 20% ($198,769) decrease from the
current year. Year-over-year differences are due to rate changes.
Recommended funding includes:
 Account 7040 Telephone Charges reflect a 3% ($84) increase based on IT communication rates.
 Account 7101 General Liability Insurance reflects a 37% ($788) increase due to increases in the
organization’s seven year experience rating.
 Account 7266 Interoffice Mail Messenger reflects a 22% ($614) increase based on current ISD –
Graphic Communication rates.
 Account 7286 PeopleSoft HR Charges reflect a 6% ($84) decrease based on current PeopleSoft
rates.
 Account 7287 PeopleSoft Financial Charges reflect a 9% ($144) increase based on PeopleSoft
rates.
 Account 7294 Professional & Specialized Services-Contracts reflect a 2% ($455) increase for the
cost of the HOMCare Registry Provider software.
 Account 7295 Professional & Specialized Services reflect a 24% ($206,665) decrease due to the
reduction of time being charged by 5610 employees to Org 5611 for performing Public Authority
Administrative support functions.
 Account 7296 Data Processing Services reflects a 19% ($5,895) increase based on ISD rates.

Assembly Bill 85 changed the funding structure of the Health and Welfare Trust by redirecting a portion
of the Sales Tax and VLF funding that would have otherwise gone to Counties’ Health Realignment
Accounts into the State Family Support Account. The methodology to calculate the redirection is based
on a statutory formula and is intended to identify the portion of each County’s Health Realignment
expenditures for the portion of the Medically Indigent Services Program (MISP) population that are now
eligible for the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The intent of the State is to redirect those funds to realize
State General Fund savings as services will no longer be paid for by County Health Realignment and will
be covered by new ACA funding. In order for the State to operationalize this shift and realize State
General Fund savings, AB 85 also created a new account in the County’s Health and Welfare Trust Fund
called the Family Support Account. This new account will receive a State-determined annual allocation
from the State Family Support Account. Each dollar received in the County’s Family Support Account
will increase the “floating MOE” of the CalWORKs Public Assistance payments and will be met with
additional dollar-for-dollar reductions in the State revenues that the County would have otherwise
received to offset CalWORKs Public Assitance payments. This is the same process followed under the
CalWORKs Assistance MOE Account.
In compliance with Section 17600.20(c) of the Welfare and Institutions Code, a 10% transfer from the
Mental Health Account to the Health Account was approved by the Board of Supervisors on April 29,
2014, as the most cost effective use of the available resources to maximize client outcomes. The FY
2014-15 budget includes a 10% transfer of $3,397,121 from Mental Health Account to the Health
Account to mitigate a revenue decrease, as a result of the AB 85 redirection of Health Realignment funds
into the State Family Support Account. The Department of Behavioral Health identified Mental Health
Realignment savings made available by ACA implementation, which shifted a portion of the indigent
population previously being served to Medi-Cal eligible effective January 1, 2014.


Significant Program Changes
The FY 2014-15 Recommended Budget for Fund 0271 reflects the 12-month projection of Sales Tax and
VLF revenues for 2011 Realignment. The revenues are overall projected to increase 12% ($16,812,174)
over current year adopted budget. The District Attorney Org 2866, in the District Attorney/Public
Defender Subaccount, allocation is $249,994 and in Org 2866 recommended appropriations the District
Attorney budgeted $203,261 and will retain a reserve balance of $46,733.


Salaries and Benefits
 Salaries and Benefits, recommended at $9,180,280 represent a 5% ($437,178) increase over the
current year. Staffing is recommended at 88 positions. Recommended funding includes:
 Account 6100 Regular Salaries reflect a 5% ($225,701) increase over current year due to
midyear adjustments of a ninth step, additional position salaries, step increases, and salary
adjustments.
 Account 6200 Extra-Help reflects a 17% ($108,395) decrease from the current year due to the
addition of five permanent positions to replace prior extra-help positions.

rates.
 Account 6400 Retirement Contribution reflects a 13% ($313,248) increase due to an increase in
retirement rates and additional staff.
 Account 6500 OASDI reflects a 2% ($9,106) increase due to an increase in Regular Salaries.
Services and Supplies
 Services and Supplies, recommended at $2,928,882, represent a 17% ($433,741) increase over the
FY 2013-14 Adopted Budget primarily due to an increase in Liability Insurance, Fleet charges, Data
Processing Services, and Small Tools & Instruments. Recommended funding includes:
 Account 7101 Liability Insurance reflects a 43% ($30,577) increase due to actual usage history
and additional facilities.
 Account 7296 Data Processing Services reflect a 10% ($40,022) increase due to the increased
need for Information Technology staff hours for the development of programs to automate
reporting provided to the State. The hourly rate for these services has increased as well. The
initial outlay will be offset by future savings to the number of man hours and costs used to
produce these reports.
 Account 7385 Small Tools & Instruments reflect a 220% ($33,100) increase due to much needed
field technology for investigations, as well as copy machines in six of the seven Agriculture
Department district offices to facilitate peak season reporting requirements.
 Account 7416 Transportation, Travel County Garage reflects a 21% ($219,932) increase due to
higher fuel charges, new vehicle depreciation, and an increase in fleet usage which will raise the
cost of maintenance and repairs for the vehicles.


Significant Program Changes
Job Growth Program:
The Board of Supervisors approved this program on September 10, 2013, during consideration of the
item regarding “Measures for Creating a Business/Job Friendly Environment”. The Board adopted a
number of goals intended to improve economic conditions in Fresno County. Two such goals include the
following programs:
 Building Permit Fee Deferral Program.
The Board of Supervisors approved this Goal (Goal No. 4) on September 10th, with a modification to
require 25% of the building fees due at permit issuance and the remaining 75% due in 25%
increments annually for the next three years without interest. In order to implement this program, a
specific funding allocation is necessary to off-set the costs of deferred revenue until the fees can be
generated to sustain the program.
Since this is a job creation/growth measure, it is understood that the building fee deferral program will
be available only to those projects creating jobs meeting the qualifying criteria as approved by the
Board.
Funding, based on FY 2013-14 permit data and estimated activity levels for FY 2014-15, is estimated
at $200,000 and is included in the recommended net County cost allocation, to offset deferred permit
revenue for the full fiscal year.
If the additional net County cost allocation is approved through this budget process, an Ordinance to
amend the Master Schedule of Fees, Charges and Recovered Costs for County Services will be
required to add a new section to the Fee Schedule (Section 2500 related to Building Construction
and Plan Review Fees) to allow for the collection of 25% of the required Building Fees and deferment
of the remaining 75% of the fees. This action will be brought to your Board shortly after the
beginning of FY 2014-15.
 Rapid Response Processing Program
Also approved on September 10, 2013 by the Board of Supervisors, is the Rapid Response
Processing program. This program will be staffed by a Senior Planner and Planner I with the primary
function of actively seeking out potential job creating business applicants in need of assistance with
land use/building permit processes. By actively seeking and assisting/facilitating these applicants, it
is surmised that additional employment opportunities will result. As with the Fee Deferral program,
job growth related businesses/applications are the focus of this program. Therefore, the priority of
the Rapid Response program will also be given to new businesses, or expansion of existing
businesses, that result in the creation of at least 20 new full time jobs (either directly by applicant or
indirectly in support businesses). However, if few such opportunities materialize under the qualifying
criteria, then the Rapid Response staff will assist all other possible job growth applicants/applications
as well as other applications in need of processing to maintain and improve application processing
timelines.
For FY 2014-15, net County cost funding in the amount of $229,485 is included in recommended
Salaries and Benefits to cover the costs for the Rapid Response Senior Planner and the Planner I
positions for the full fiscal year.
Salaries and Benefits
 Salaries and Benefits represent an 18% ($1,028,419) increase over the FY 2013-14 Adopted Budget
due to the addition of nine positions, salary adjustments, promotions, and retirement rate increases.
Recommended funding includes:
 Fifty-four positions in the Development Services Division and four positions in the Capital
Projects Division for a total of fifty-eight positions.
 Account 6100 Regular Salaries increased 17% ($520,100) over the current year primarily due to
the addition of nine positions in the Development Services Division.
 Account 6400 Retirement Contribution increased 24% ($405,824) over the current year primarily
due to the increased positions, increased salaries and increased retirement rates.
 Account 6550 Workers’ Compensation decreased 20% ($17,732) from the current year due to
recent claims experience.
 Account 6600 Health Insurance Contribution increased $50,900 (16%) over the current year due
to the increase in positions.
Services and Supplies
 Services and Supplies represent a 36% ($708,821) increase over the FY 2013-14 Adopted Budget.
Recommended funding includes:
 An appropriation of $19,000 in net County cost allocation to pay for tourism related activities.
These activities are solely to maintain the Blossom and Fruit Trails, along with the related website
maintenance, media relations and no-cost marketing cooperatives as time and funding permit.
 Appropriations of $289,741 to support ongoing capital projects. These appropriations are fully
offset by funded projects.
 An appropriation of $283,745 in net County cost for monitoring of closed landfills as mandated by
Title 27 of the California Code of Regulations.
 Account 7265 Office Expense increased 27% ($14,800) over the current year due to increased
work being done by Development Services.
 Account 7295 Professional & Specialized Services increased 48% ($606,492) over the current
year due to additional consultant contracts to meet service level demands.
 Account 7400 Special Departmental Expense decreased 44% ($16,000) from the current year
due to the reduction in the agreement amount between the Fresno County Stream Group and
Fresno Irrigation District.

Significant Program Changes
Some of the increase in appropriations is reflective of the several large multi-year bridge projects with all
phases of development increasing in FY 2014-15. However, much of the overall budget still reflects an
allocation of funds for specific Measure “C” and Federal Aid projects that will be awarded for construction
or have significant design engineering completed in the coming fiscal years.
The allocation of funding also considered the current unstable prices of oil products, such as asphalt
concrete and liquid asphalts, and aggregate materials used in road maintenance and new construction.
Staffing is recommended at the current level of 196 positions.
The department continues its team-based approach in seeking to identify avenues for improving service
to our clients and other County departments. This is evident in the scheduling of heavy equipment usage
by our road maintenance yards so as to promote sharing of the equipment. This venture has allowed us
to reduce our heavy equipment fleet by approximately 29% from the levels in FY 2012-13. This includes
working with other jurisdictions on projects of common interest. The use of advanced electronic and
computer technology in areas such as Geographic Information Systems, and the Cost Accounting
Management System (CAMS) is being employed.
Road Maintenance
The FY 2014-15 programs consist of the following components:
Day Labor Rehabilitation, Specific Maintenance Projects, and
Pavement Seals and Maintenance Overlays .................... ........ $ 5.77 million
Contract Preventive Maintenance..................................... ........ $11.20 million
Routine Road Maintenance Activities .............................. ........ $10.35 million
Traffic Signs and Striping ................................................. ........ $ 1.28 million
Traffic Safety and Operations .......................................... ........ $ 1.61 million
Total ............................................................................ ........$30.21 million
A total of $5.77 million is recommended for day labor rehabilitation and specific maintenance projects for
roads. These funds will be expended for the rehabilitation of approximately 33 miles of selected lower
traffic volume roads by day labor forces. Approximately $300,000 (not included in the $5.77 million
allocation) has been budgeted for maintenance of private roads in the County Service Areas (CSAs).
The CSAs will reimburse the Road Fund for all maintenance work.
The recommended $11.2 million for contract preventive maintenance projects will provide for the
maintenance treatment of approximately 30 miles of chip seal projects, and 18 miles of asphalt concrete
overlay. The preventive maintenance allocation also reflects $3.30 million of Congestion Mitigation and
Air Quality (CMAC) Shoulder projects throughout the County, as well as $2 million for Joint Seal
replacements on various County bridges.
Pothole patching, shoulder maintenance, and other routine road maintenance activities, including culvert
maintenance, storm damage repairs, tree trimming, and snow removal are recommended at $10.35
million. The allocation of expenditures to the various general maintenance categories can vary in any
given year. For example, in years when above average precipitation occurs, the cost for snow removal,
storm response and signing, and storm damage repairs will consume more of these allocations than in
normal years.
Traffic signs and striping, including installation and maintenance of traffic signs, pavement markings, and
line striping is recommended at $1.28 million. This allocation includes funding for agreements with
Caltrans for Caltrans-operated traffic signals at joint State/County intersections at an annual cost of
approximately $50,000 and the City of Fresno for the maintenance of County-owned traffic signals and
lighting at an annual amount of approximately $135,000 and with a private contractor in the annual
amount of $20,000 to maintain a traffic signal and lighting installed by the State on Jayne Avenue in the
Coalinga area as a condition of development for the State Hospital facility (traffic volumes entering and
leaving the facility warranted a traffic signal on Jayne Avenue and since Jayne Avenue is a County road,
the signal became the property of the County).
Included in the $30.21 million allocation in the proposed budget for road maintenance and traffic signs
and striping, there is an allocation of $1.61 million for traffic safety and operations activities. This
allocation provides for the preparation and review of Traffic Safety Studies to determine the need for
four-way stop signs, other traffic control devices, traffic control needs, review and approval of
encroachment permits for work to be done within the County road right-of-way, issuance of oversize load
permits for County roads, and various other operational and safety roadway related activities. This
allocation also includes the Traffic Census (traffic count program) section in the Maintenance and
Operations division.
Road and Bridge Construction
Major projects for FY 2014-15 include:
 Measure C Funded projects: Cedar Avenue Bike Lane (City of Fresno and County joint project),
Americans with Disability Act Compliance projects and Mt. View Avenue irrigation facilities, Bethel to

year due to increased retirement rates and increased salaries.
 Account 6670 Benefits Administration represents an 11% ($2,724) decrease from the current
year due to reduced rates provided by Risk Management.
Services and Supplies
 Services and Supplies reflect a 10% ($3,399,628) increase over FY 2013-14 primarily due to
increases in road maintenance services and professional engineering consultants for bridge design.
Recommended funding includes:
 Eight federally funded bridge replacement projects: Italian Bar Bridge ($0.45 million), Outside
Canal on Russell, ($0.25 million), Travers Creek Bridge on Manning, ($0.20 million) and five

increase of 2% ($100,000), to reimburse the Fleet Services Org 8910-11 for the cost of operating
and maintaining all vehicles, including construction equipment. Maintenance costs for vehicles
and equipment have been steady for the last two fiscal years; the increase this year will fund the
depreciation and inflation cost for several new pieces of heavy equipment.
 Account 7430 Utilities represent a 2% ($5,614) increase for payments for County traffic signals,
road maintenance yard facilities, and sign shop and resident engineer field trailers.
Other Charges
 Other Charges are recommended at $550,000 for right-of-way acquisition for various on-going
projects.
Fixed Assets
 Falling Weight Deflectometer to replace existing machine. Parts are no longer available to keep it

(1) Color Printer/Scanner/Copier...................... $7,000........Replacement


Services and Supplies
 Services and Supplies reflect an overall increase of 8% ($214,500) over the FY 2013-14 Adopted
Budget and represent monies allocated directly to transit providers and for regional transportation
planning.
Recommended funding includes the following allocations in Account 7295, Professional &
Specialized Services:
 An allocation to the City of Fresno ($2,018,000) represents a 5% increase over the current year
for services to the unincorporated area within the Fresno urban transit service area.
 An allocation to 19 rural transit subsystems ($385,000) represents a 43% increase over the
current year allocation. Since FY 2009-10, FCRTA has used contingency funding that had been
held as matching dollars for capital projects to offset local agency contributions. For this year’s
budgeting process, staff is assured that FCRTA will continue to use contingency funds to offset
local agency contributions for the next fiscal year; however, the offset is less than previous years.
 An allocation for transportation social services ($258,000) represents a 5% increase over the
current year for clients of community-based social service agencies in the unincorporated area,
performed under contract by the Fresno County Economic Opportunities Commission.
 An allocation to the Fresno COG ($147,000) represents a 5% increase over the current year for
operation of the Regional Transportation Planning Agency pursuant to the Transportation

within the parks. With the Ernest Lawrence funding, Parks staff purchased and installed 85 new
concrete tables and 111 new barbeque grills and fire rings. Increased service hours from two additional
staff added in the current year, funded by an increase in available net County cost, also allowed for

tree and shrub maintenance, facilities (restroom cleanliness and supplies), graffiti abatement and litter
removal.

Significant Program Changes
Permanent closure of the Coalinga Disposal Site (CDS) – CDS ceased to accept waste November 2009.
On September 28, 2010 the County of Fresno entered into an agreement with Shaw Environmental &
Infrastructure Inc. to provide civil design engineering services, in accordance with Title 27 California
Code of Regulations (CCR) to develop Final Closure and Post-closure Maintenance Plans, prepare
plans, specifications and estimates for construction of final cover, a gas network plan and to provide a
construction quality assurance (CQA) plan and perform CQA services. It is anticipated the construction
of the final cover will be completed in FY 2014-15.
American Avenue Disposal Site (AADS) has completed the Phase III Modules 4, 5 & 6 Landfill
Expansion. The expansion was required to comply with the fill sequence plan developed by Shaw
Environmental & Infrastructure Inc. and for the preparation of the Phase I Reclamation Project (clean
closure, removal of waste from the 30 acres of unlined area) and to comply with Title 27 CCR
requirements.
A Clean-Up Abatement Order (98-702) was issued by the Regional Water Quality Control Board
(RWQCB) in 1998 due to volatile organic compounds detected in the AADS ground water monitoring
wells adjacent the Phase I fill area (unlined 30 acre area). Since 2005, the AADS RWQCB Waste
Discharge Requirements (WDR’s) have stated that the County proposes to remove the waste from the
unlined portion of the site and place it into a lined area. The Phase I area also resides in the future fill
areas of Phase III, Modules 11 & 12 and in order for Phase III Modules 11 & 12 to be constructed, Phase
I will need to be clean closed in accordance with Title 27. Staff has budgeted $15,000,000 to start the
clean closure in FY 2014-15 however this project may be delayed if the City of Fresno diverts its waste to
another landfill. RWQCB could still require the County to initiate the project if there is a change in the
detection of compounds in the groundwater. The Phase I Reclamation project is estimated to take
approximately three to five years to complete from project initiation to regulatory approval of clean
closure. The potential risk in not performing the Phase I Reclamation project is that doing so may result
in a cease and desist order from the RWQCB, including the inability to accept and process waste.
