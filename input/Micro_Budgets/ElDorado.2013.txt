The Recommended Budget represents an overall decrease of $55,649 or 85% in revenues and
a decrease of $90,980 or 5% in appropriations when compared to the FY 2012-13 approved
budget. As a result, the Net County Cost has decreased $35,331 or 2%.
The change in revenues is due to a decrease in one-time interfund revenues ($27K) and a
decrease in charges for service to other County departments ($28K). The decrease in one-time
funds relates to the grant award last year from the Air Quality Management District for the
purchase of video conferencing equipment for the Grand Jury. This equipment was purchased,
so there is no grant funding for FY 2103-14. The decrease in charges for service has to do with
charges to departments for processing agenda items. These charges are very difficult to track
and substantiate, therefore the department does not anticipate charging for services for agenda
processing at this time.
The decrease in appropriations is primarily comprised of the net of a decrease in computer
equipment related to the reduction for one-time video conferencing equipment, offset with an
increase in transportation and travel due to moving approved travel for Board members into the
Clerk’s budget. In addition, the salary and benefits budgets for the individual districts have been
trued up to reflect actual salary and benefit costs. This is a departure from Board of Supervisors
Policy D-5 - Board of Supervisors Departmental Budget and Expense Reimbursement and
should be discussed and approved during the budget workshop. These changes result in salary
and benefit reductions of $111,494.


The Recommended Budget represents an overall decrease of $1,397,688 or 46% in revenues
and a decrease of $1,862,559 or 19% in appropriations when compared to the FY 2012-13
approved budget. As a result, the Net County Cost is decreased by $464,871 or 7%.

There are several functions currently being performed within this core unit of the Chief
Administrative Office. Some of these functions include;
 Budget development and monitoring
 Development of county-wide financial standards and practices in coordination with the
Auditor-Controller
 Implementation of Investment Strategy
 Management of Investment teams (Human Resources, Risk Management, Facilities and
Real Property, Department Culture and Accountability, Economic Development, and
Information Technologies)
 Legislative monitoring
CHIEF ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE
 Policy development
 Public Outreach and overall project management for the Targeted General Plan
Amendment
 Coordination with local agencies on county-wide issues (ie. Fire, LAFCO, CSD, etc.)
 Acting Director of Community Development Agency
 Economic Development
 Oversight of Risk Management and Human Resources
 Executive Management coordination and development
 Fiscal and administrative support for the District Attorney and Public Defender
 Support for ERP analysis and implementation
Currently the budget and operations function within the Chief Administrative Office is short
staffed. The decision was made to move one Principal Administrative Analyst full-time into the
Procurement function as well as one Sr. Department Analyst that was originally programmed for
the Central Fiscal/Admin unit. Resources have been added to the Procurement function in an
effort to strengthen and stream line internal services functions to departments. The budget and
operations unit also has one Principal Administrative Analyst that is currently serving as the
Acting Director of Information Technologies and one Principal Administrative Analyst serving as
the project manager for multiple major facilities capital improvement projects. Therefore work
that was previously done by four Principal Administrative Analyst’s and an Internal Auditor is
now being done by two Principal Administrative Analyst’s and the Chief Budget Officer;
essentially a reduction of three FTE’s. The Assistant Chief Administrative Officer is also
deployed as the Acting Director of the Community Development Agency as well as providing
oversight to Risk Management and Economic Development.
Therefore, the Recommended budget includes an additional staff request for a Procurement
and Contracts Manager to free up the Principal Analyst allocation currently assigned to
Procurements and Contracts. In addition the department will be filling the Principal
Administrative Analyst position previously held by the current Acting Director of Information
Technologies. The Recommended budget request also includes an add/delete of the Internal
Auditor with a Principal Analyst to true up the allocation based on actual staff. There is no cost
difference between the Principal Analyst and the Internal Auditor. Other staffing changes
related to truing up existing filled allocations include the deletion of the CAO Administrative
Analyst (due to the addition of the Parks Manager added in April 2013) and the deletion of a
CAO Administrative Technician and the addition of an Administrative Technician.
The Recommended Budget for this unit represents an overall decrease of $115,382 in revenues
and a decrease of $423,461 in appropriations when compared to the FY 2012-13 approved
budget. As a result, the Net County Cost is decreased by $308,079. Changes in revenues and
appropriations are primarily related to revenues and expenses related to Economic
Development, Rubicon and Parks as funding and expenses for staff assigned to these activities
has moved into the Economic Development/Parks & Trails budget.
Procurement
The Recommended Budget for this unit represents an overall decrease of $55,135 in revenues
and a decrease of $61,243 in appropriations when compared to the FY 2012-13 approved
budget. As a result, the Net County Cost is decreased by $6,108. These changes are primarily
related to decreased revenue and expenses related to the Court opting out of the County mail 

service. The budget also includes an add/delete of a Sr. Department Analyst with a Department
Analyst. This results in approximately $30K in salary and benefit savings.
Rubicon Trail
The Rubicon budget has been moved to the Economic Development / Parks & Trails budget.
Central Fiscal/Administrative
The Recommended Budget for this unit represents an increase in revenues of $56,535 and an
increase in appropriations of $36,269 resulting in a decrease to Net County Cost of $20,266
when compared to the FY 2012-13 approved budget. The budget includes the add/delete of the
Fiscal Administrative Manager with a Chief Fiscal Officer resulting an annual increase of
approximately $10K in salaries and benefits. The complexity and large dollar amounts
associated with the financial management that this unit provides is very large and justifies the
higher level allocation.
Facilities
The Recommended Budget for this unit represents an increase in revenues of $570,269 and
$439,851 in appropriations when compared to the FY 2012-13 approved budget. This results in
a decrease to Net County Cost of $130,418.
The increased revenues and appropriations are primarily related to implementation of the
facilities Capital Improvement Plan. Recently the County completed a facilities study and is in
the process of implementing a facilities Capital Improvement plan. The department is reorganizing
and assigning specific personnel to these projects. The budget assumes that
several of these projects will be completed with internal staff and funded with Accumulative
Capital Outlay funds.
The facilities unit is requesting the following staffing changes as part of the re-organization to
gear up for the facilities plan:
 Delete a Custodian Supervisor and add a Building Operations Technician (additional
cost fully offset with ACO funds)
 Add 1 FTE Grounds Maintenance Worker (this will actually be recruited and filled as two
.5 Grounds Maintenance Workers to allow for deployment to multiple sites at the same
time. This will free up current Grounds Maintenance workers for facility or park project
work)
 Add .5 Custodian (this position is almost fully offset with savings from a reduction in
professional services which will now be handled by this staff)
Fund 13 – Accumulative Capital Outlay
Capital Facilities Workplan
The table below includes the Facilities Capital Workplan. This is a pre-liminary plan and the
Department will be returning to the Board for a more in depth discussion of the Facilities Capital
Improvement Plan.


The Recommended Budget represents an overall increase of $9,533 or 2% in revenues and an
increase of $9,852 or less than 1% in appropriations when compared to the FY 2012-13
approved budget. As a result, the Net County Cost has increased $319 or less than 1%.
The increase in revenues is due to increased audit fees due to an increase in the number of
external audits performed. The change in appropriations is primarily related to slight increases
in salaries and benefits.
The Chief Administrative Office is recommending several add/deletes to the Auditor’s personnel
allocation to true up the allocations with actual filled positions. These changes do not impact
the Net County Cost as the salaries budgeted match the recommended add/deletes.


The Recommended Budget represents an overall increase of $132,810 or 8% in revenues and
an increase of $196,032 or 7% in appropriations when compared to the FY 2012-13 approved
budget. As a result, the Net County Cost has increased $63,222 or 5%.
The increase in revenues is related to three different areas; auctions for tax defaulted properties
($48K), banking costs ($20K) and time share sales ($60K). The time share sales may be
outsourced to a third party vendor to offer at an online auction. The increase in revenue of
$60K is partially offset with an increase in appropriations of $35K in professional and
specialized services. Other increases in appropriations are in the areas of extra help ($54K)
based on FY 2012-13 usage of extra help and increases in retirement ($16K) and health
insurance ($20K). The department is requesting fixed asset appropriations of $19K to purchase
a Microform scanner and camera to replace the current microfilm imaging system.
The department requested the addition of a temporary Sr. Accountant to backfill senior staff
currently working on implementation of the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system. The
Chief Administrative Office is not recommending including funding at this time. The ERP
Executive Steering Committee will be working with the project manager on a county-wide
budget for ERP implementation and any costs for additional staff will be included in that budget
vs. department budgets.
The department has included funding of $35,000 for an outside service that will assist, for a fee,
an Internet Auction. This fee is offset with revenue from the auction sale. Before proceeding
with the selection of an outside service, the Chief Administrative Office is recommending that
the Treasurer Tax-Collector work with Information Technologies to make sure this is the most
cost effective and viable option. If it is determined that this service can be done in house,
adjustments to the Department’s budget will be made at Addenda.


The Recommended Budget represents an overall increase of $7,500 or 1% in revenues and a
increase of $184,538 or 5% in appropriations when compared to the FY 2012-13 approved
budget. As a result, the Net County Cost has increased $177,038 or 6%.
Revenues for the most part remain flat. The increase in appropriations is related to salaries and
benefits. The Assistant Assessor position has remained vacant and unfunded for two years.
The department is requesting to fund and fill this position in FY 2013-14 at a cost of
approximately $146,000. In addition the department is requesting to delete an Appraiser Aide
position and add an Appraiser I/II/Sr at an approximate cost of $30,000.


The Recommended Budget represents an overall decrease of $35,920 or 7% in revenues and
an increase of $206,350 or 7% in appropriations when compared to the FY 2012-13 approved
budget. As a result, the Net County Cost has increased $242,270 or 11%.
The change in revenues is due to a decrease in anticipated revenues from departments for legal
services. The change in appropriations is the result of increased salary and benefit costs
associated with the addition of staff approved by the Board in December 2012 adding two (2)
FTE’s to handle the increased caseload related to the Public Guardian.


The Recommended Budget represents an overall increase of $2,652,862 or 7% in revenues
and an increase of $2,913,862 or 7% in appropriations when compared to the FY 2012-13
approved budget. The Net County Cost has increased $261,000 or 21%.
The Human Resources Division receives no revenues. Revenues for the Risk Management
internal service fund are increasing slightly to offset minor increases in program costs. Funding
for the Liability and Worker’s Compensation programs is based on actuarial analysis and
recommendations of Bickmore Risk Services and Consulting. Both programs had previously
been funded above the 85% confidence level. Based on previous Board direction, the funding
for these programs has now been set at the expected confidence level with taking the
overfunding over a two year period to draw down the program fund balance. This results in
minor adjustments in cost applied charges to departments and a use of Risk fund balance to
eliminate prior year surpluses and bring the actual funding in these programs down closer to the
70% confidence level.
Appropriation increases of $2,916,862 are associated primarily with services and supplies in
Human Resources and Risk Management. The majority of increases are associated with the
increased cost of health benefits in Risk Management and an increase in Human Resources
associated with labor negotiations, an anticipated class and comparison study, countywide
training, and legal services. Several of the increased Human Resources expenses were
previously budgeted in Department 15, resulting in an offsetting decrease in expenses in that
department.
The budget for the Health Benefits program includes health insurance costs for current
employees and retiree health insurance. Health insurance costs are based on projections by
Alliant Insurance Services, the County’s health benefits consultant. The Board approved
membership in the EIA Health program through CSAC-EIA, which is calculated based upon a
calendar year. Any possible rate changes effective January 1, 2014, will not be known until this
fall; the budget is based on a 7.0% placeholder increase for the budget year. The budget will be
revised as necessary once the rates have been negotiated with the insurance carriers and new
rates are known. Funding for the County’s contribution for retiree health insurance is on a “pay
as you go” basis, as in the previous two fiscal years. The Retiree Health Contribution Plan
Document caps the amount to be spent on this benefit at 1.2% of Total Payroll. The estimated
calculated cap is $1,642,068 which is based on FY 12/13 actuals and will be adjusted upon final
calculation in the addenda. This amount will be paid through cost-applied charges to the
departments.


The Recommended Budget represents an overall increase of $283,700 or 8% in revenues and
an increase of $362,288 or 8.7% in appropriations when compared to the FY 2012-13 approved
budget. Overall, Net County Cost is increasing by $78,588 or 9%. The increase in Net County
Cost is offset with a corresponding increase in revenue in Department 15. In the past, a portion
of the Cable Franchise Fees were transferred into Information Technologies. The Chief
Administrative Office is recommending that this practice stop and that all Cable Franchise Fee
revenue remains in Department 15. This changes results in no change to overall County costs
and creates an efficiency in one less accounting transaction moving funds from one department
to another.
Sources of revenue in Information Technologies are found in two different areas within the
budget. Revenue for this department is a combination of Charges for Services (Class 13) and
Intrafund Abatements (Class 73 shown in the appropriations section). Revenue in the Charges
for Services reflects in overall increase of $283,700 due to the transfer of four employees from
the Community Development Agency being transferred to IT to provide centralized IT support
rather than decentralized. This revenue will be offset with staffing costs. A reduction of $76,500
in Charges for Services reflects the transfer of Franchise Fee revenue from the IT budget to
Department 15.
In the Intrafund Abatements area, revenue is projected to be approximately $43,543 lower than
FY 2012-13. This is primarily in the areas of programming and print shop which was closed
during FY 2012-13. Cost applied methodology for IT is currently under review. Any changes in
these areas will be adjusted in the addenda prior to approval of the adopted budget.
Salaries and benefits for the Information Technologies Department include an organizational
staffing change which will move four (4.0) FTE from the Community Development Agency
(CDA) to Information Technologies. This change will allow IT to provide service to the CDA
from a centralized support model. Changes included in the budget are:
 Add 2.0 FTE Sr. Information Technology Department Coordinator – One of these
positions is moving from the Transportation Division. The other position is moving from
the Building Division.
 Add 1.0 FTE Information Technology Department Coordinator – This position is moving
from the Transportation Division.
 Add 1.0 FTE Information Technology Department Specialist – This position is moving
from the Environmental Management Division.
In March 2013, the Board of Supervisors approved a contract with Tyler Technologies for the
implementation of an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system. This Countywide project will
be a turning point for the County from a technology perspective as well as redefining the way
the County manages internal business processes. The Assistant Director of Information
Technologies has been assigned to be the Project Manager for the County. Over the past two
years the IT Department has been preparing for this change. In the area of staffing the
Department continues to look for ways to meet current operational needs for old mainframe
based systems, while at the same time, trying to adjust for various skill sets that will be required
to meet new technology needs.

Services and supplies are increasing overall by $126,930. The budget includes funding to
replace some end of life parts in the Network area and also in the Server area. There is also
funding in the budget to support continued implementation of Voice over IP (VoIP) and
continued implementation of a voicemail replacement system.
Fixed assets have been budgeted at $352,900 which includes funding to continue to improve
network infrastructure needed to support modern technology. Funding has also been included
to purchase an appliance to support better, faster and more reliable data back-up. The current
volume of data being backed up has grown to the point where it takes the better part of a week
to accomplish fill and incremental back-ups. The appliance will also help resolve data deduplication
issues which have become difficult to manage. In addition, there is also a variety of
network and server fixed assets that are needed to replace end of life equipment and to improve
network management efficiency.
The budget does not include any funding for PC refresh. If funding becomes available
Information Technologies recommends the Board approve $100,000 for PC refresh computers.
This will allow the County to replace approximately 100 end of life or under performing
machines. It will also assist in bringing the County current with newer technology, specifically
Windows 2007, Windows 8 and Office 2010 products. As the County moves forward with newer
applications and software,the older machines do not have the ability to run the newer
developed software.


The Recommended Budget represents an overall increase of $915,486 in revenues and an
increase of $1,088,715 or 63% in appropriations when compared to the FY 2012-13 approved
budget. As a result, the Net County Cost has increased $173,229 or 10%.
The Recommended Budget for Economic Development has been calculated using 75% of
actual Transient Occupancy Tax (TOT) revenues for FY 2011-12; however, this amount will be
revised in the Addenda process to reflect 75% of the actual TOT revenues for FY 2012-13, once
that amount is known. Appropriations for Economic Development include funding for two staff
positions ($229,079), extra help to assist with special events and projects ($7,000), $767,000 for
promotional contracts, $240,000 for carry over projects from FY 2012-13, and $200,000 to be
programmed at a later date based on input from the County’s Economic Investment Team and
the Community and Economic Development Advisory Committee and direction from the Board
of Supervisors.
The Recommended Budget for Parks and River is moving from Environmental Management.
The Net County Cost for this program is increasing $110,750 from FY 2012-13 for a total Net
County Cost of $274,442. A large portion of this increase is offset with savings in the Chief
Administrative Office budget. The increase is primarily related to increased salaries and
benefits for staff dedicated 100% to parks and trails.
The Recommended Budget for the Rubicon is decreasing due to less grant funding in FY 2013-
14. There is no Net County Cost associated with the Rubicon budget. The budget has moved
over from the Chief Administrative Office.
On May 21, 2013, the Board approved in concept moving the Housing Community and
Economic Development program out of Human Services and into the Economic Development /
Parks & Trails budget. This change will be further defined at Addenda. The Recommended
Budget includes the addition of one Administrative Services Officer and one Administrative
Technician for this program. These positions will be deleted in Human Services and staff
transferred to the Chief Administrative Office.


The Recommended Budget represents an overall decrease of $713,670 or 23% in revenues
and a decrease of $753,271 or 18% in appropriations when compared to the FY 2012-13
approved budget. As a result, the Net County Cost has decreased $39,601 or 4%.
The change in revenues is related to reduced funding for elections due to an anticipated smaller
voter turnout for the June 3, 2014 Gubernatorial Primary Election vs. the November 6, 2012
Presidential Election. The reduction in revenues is offset with corresponding reductions in
appropriations.
The budget for the Recorder-Clerk/Registrar of Voters is recommended at a base level, and fully
funds all existing allocations.

The membership and focus areas of the Grand Jury changes from year to year. The FY 2013-
14 Recommended Budget is based on the FY 2012-13 request.


The Recommended Budget for the Court Maintenance of Effort represents a decrease in
revenue of $199,000 or 12% and an increase in appropriations of $499,000 or 20% from the FY
2012-13 approved budget. As a result, the Net County Cost is increased $698,000 or 81%.
The large increase in Net County Cost is the result of an ongoing death penalty case. The costs
associated with this case are uncertain. These costs may be expended in FY 2012-13 in which
case an adjustment to the Court budget will take place in addenda reducing appropriations.
The Court facilities budget with Department 20 continues to reflect the full year funding for the
County Facility Payment (CFP) as required by AB1491. In addition, the budget has been
adjusted to reflect revenue from the State for costs incurred by the County for buildings where
the County and the Courts share space, but the County manages the buildings. This revenue is
estimated at $65,000 for the year.
The appropriation for the conflict panel includes funding for ten attorneys, seven on the west
slope and three in Lake Tahoe. At the time of this publication the contracts with the indigent
defense panel are under negotiation. Any changes will be incorporated into the Addenda.
The budget also includes $10,000 to cover the cost of any criminal grand jury expenses should
a panel be called during the year.


The Recommended Budget represents an overall increase of $264,775 or 11% in revenues and
an increase of $400,581 or 5% in appropriations when compared to the FY 2012-13 approved
budget. As a result, the Net County Cost is increased by $135,806 or 2%.
The increase in revenue is primarily related to the Office of Traffic Safety grant as well as a
slight increase from Proposition 172 – Public Safety Sales Tax. These increases are partially
offset with decreased funding in the Environmental and Prop 64 programs.
The increase in appropriations is primarily related to increased salaries and benefits. The
department is requesting several personnel allocation changes to true up allocations currently
alternately filled. Permanent salaries are increasing $312K and retirement $123K from the FY
2012-13 approved budget. Some of these increased costs are offset with increased revenues
from the Office of Traffic Safety grant. The department is reducing temporary help $35K and
unemployment insurance is decreasing $40K.
The recommended budget includes a deletion of one (1.0) vacant Legal Secretary and one (1.0)
vacant Legal Office Assistant and the addition of one (1.0) Deputy District Attorney I/IV; the
add/delete of a DA Investigator with an Accountant Auditor and the add/delete of a Legal
Secretarial Services Supervisor with a Sr. Legal Secretary. The budget also reduces the funding
for the vacant Fiscal Administrative Manger to a part-time Sr. Department Analyst. This position
is currently under review and additional changes may be brought forth during the Addenda.


The Recommended Budget represents an overall increase of $38,668 or 12% in revenues and
an increase of $185,844 or 6% in appropriations when compared to the FY 2012-13 approved
budget. As a result, the Net County Cost is increased by $147,176 or 5%.
Revenue has increased slightly for Prop 172, Public Safety Sales Tax ($12K). The remaining
increase is related to AB 109 funding. The department is still identifying specific services that
can be funded with AB 109 funds. The Community Corrections Partnership will be meeting in
June to establish the FY 2013-14 budget. Any changes will be brought forward in Addenda.
The Recommended Budget includes the addition of one (1) FTE in FY 2013-14 at an
approximate cost of $96K. The Chief Administrative Office is recommending the addition of an
Administrative Services Officer (ASO). The Department has a huge need for administrative and
fiscal management. A specific need has been identified for process and policy creation and
implementation for multiple administrative and legal services that the Department provides.
Currently support services are provided by the Chief Administrative office in the Central Fiscal
Admin unit. These services include fiscal accounting, budgeting, contracts and other clerical
related work. This workload will be shifted back to the Public Defender once an ASO is hired
and trained.
Overall salaries and benefits are increasing by $128K primarily related to the addition of the
ASO as well as overall increases in health insurance and retirement costs. Services and
supplies have increased $59K primarily related to an anticipated professional services contract
for Investigative Services. The Public Defender is in the process of re-evaluating the amount of
investigative services required and adjustments may be made at Addenda. Currently
investigative services are being provided with extra-help staff as well as one permanent staff
who will be retiring within the next few months.


The Recommended Budget represents an overall decrease of $989,281 or 7% in revenues and
an increase of $46,797 or less than 1% in appropriations when compared to the FY 2012-13
approved budget. As a result, the Net County Cost is increased by $1,036,078 or 2.5%.
The largest source of revenue for the Sheriff’s Office continues to be Proposition 172 - Public
Safety Sales Tax revenue. This revenue stream has increased over the last three years and is
projected to continue to increase in FY 2013-14. The CAO’s office closely monitors this
revenue stream and if any adjustments are necessary, they will be made in the addenda
process.
The primary reason for the overall reduction in revenue is a result of the following:
- The Sheriff is requesting to remove $500,000 in Rural County Revenue from his
operating budget, and instead have this revenue placed in a Special Revenue Fund. In
FY 2011-12 and 2012-13 these funds were used to purchase equipment that was
necessary to comply with Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Narrowbanding
requirements.
This funding stream is authorized pursuant to Government Code section 30070 which
states the funds shall be allocated to county sheriff departments to enhance law
enforcement efforts. In addition, funds allocated pursuant to this section shall be used to
supplement rather than supplant existing law enforcement resources.
To ensure the funds are not supplanting existing resources, the Chief Administrative
Office supports the Sheriff’s request to place these funds in a Special Revenue Fund.
- The second primary reason for the NCC increase is the loss of $267,350 in Title III
funding that was provided to offset search and rescue division costs. This was
unanticipated one time revenue that was added to the Sheriff’s Office budget during the
FY 2012-13 addenda process, the loss of which was anticipated by the County.
- Lastly, the Sheriff’s Office budget request does not include the use of Asset Forfeiture
funds. In the FY 2012-13 adopted budget, the Sheriff’s Office included the use of
$144,375 in Asset Forfeiture funds to fund the purchase of various unmet needs.
Overall salaries and benefits are increasing by $1,371,820. The budget includes a slight
decrease in overtime cost of $86,128 for a total overtime budget of $1,973,043. This amount
represents the lowest overtime budget since FY 2005-06. Overtime hit a high in FY 2006-07
with actual expenditures of $4,095,143. Since taking office, the Sheriff’s Office has changed
operating practices to reduce the amount of overtime. Current year expenditures through April
2013 are $1,388,650 indicating the Sheriff’s Office continues to appropriately manage the use of
overtime.
The Sheriff is requesting the following changes in staffing:
 Delete 2.0 Court Security Officers and add 1 Sheriff Deputy to work in the Courts. All
costs associated with this change are offset with revenue from the State, resulting in no
 Add 1.0 Property Evidence Technician. Current staff levels are resulting in excessive
overtime and even with the overtime, staff are unable to manage evidence processing
and purge evidence in a timely manner. A portion of these additional costs will be offset
with a reduction in overtime.
 Add 1.0 Administrative Technician to work in the Sheriff’s Fiscal Division. This position
is necessary to improve the day to day operations of the division specifically related to
budget and contract analysis, and will return the fiscal division to the staffing level it had
prior to when reductions were made during the economic downturn.
Services and supplies are decreasing overall by $453,667. The budget includes numerous
increases and decreases. Notable decreases include software of $56,706, minor equipment of
$134,988 and telephone and radio equipment of $282,775. One notable area of increase is an
additional $50,000 towards staff development. One area of concern continues to be increases
and fluctuations in fuel costs, budgeted at $901,394.
Other charges are decreasing by $338,050. This is related to transactions with non-county
governmental agencies, and is primarily offset with grant revenue. At this time the FY 2013
Homeland Security grant amount is unknown and will likely be added to the budget during the
addenda process, at which time ‘other charges’ appropriations will likely increase. Any
increases will be offset with corresponding revenue increases, resulting in no change to NCC.
Fixed Assets are decreasing overall by $133,469 due to fewer anticipated fixed asset purchase
from Homeland Security Grants. Intrafund Transfers are decreasing overall by $49,837 based
on budgeted transfers between departments.
Jail Commissary (non General Fund): The Jail Commissary budget is projected at a total of
$357,950. This budget is completely offset by revenue from the Inmate Welfare Trust account.
There is no Net County Cost associated with this program.


The Recommended Budget represents an overall decrease of $348,715 or 7% in revenues and
an increase of $374,982 or 3% in appropriations when compared to the FY 2012-13 approved
budget. As a result, the Net County Cost is increased by $723,697 or 8%.
The reduction in revenue is primarily related to a decrease in SB678 funding of $329,985. The
Governor’s budget provides $36 million for SB 678 grants in FY 2013/2014, which is a reduction
of $103 million compared to the estimated amount for FY 2012/2013. A revised methodology is
being proposed, in part, to account for 2011 Realignment (AB 109, Public Safety Realignment).
It’s anticipated an adjustment to this amount will occur during the Governor’s May Revise.
The department is also expecting reduced revenues of $50K related to outside contracts for
county detention facility commitments as contracts are renegotiated and guaranteed reserved
bed space is reduced and a $15K reduction in Juvenile Hall revenue due to reduced populations
in both Juvenile Detention Facilities. Revenue from Proposition 172 – Public Safety Sales Tax
includes an increase of $113,181 based on the FY 2012-13 year end estimate of $1,117,751.
The increase in appropriations is related to a $411,792 increase in salaries and benefits. In
October 2012, the Board approved the addition of eight new positions to provide additional staff
for the juvenile detention facilities. The FY 2013-14 budget includes a full year of salary and
benefits for these positions vs. the 2/3 included in the FY 2012-13 budget ($350K) as well as
overall increases in health insurance ($181K) and retirement costs ($238K). Some of these
increases are offset with reductions in overtime and temporary help costs ($319K) as well as a
reduction in unemployment insurance ($81K).
The budget includes $1,290,000 of AB109 Justice Realignment Plan which went into effect in
October 2011. Appropriations are in the areas of salaries and benefits $850,000, Electronic
Monitoring Program (EMP) $50,000, Transitional Housing $40,000, and Community Corrections
Center start-up and operational costs $350,000. The Community Corrections Partnership
(CCP) voting committee will meet prior to the Adopted Budget to adopt the full FY 2013-14
AB109 budget. The County will get the FY 2013-14 budget appropriation from the State in the
next few weeks. Once that number is known, the Chief Probation Officer will convene a CCP
meeting to obtain full AB 109 budget approval and bring back to the Board of Supervisors.
AB109 changes will be included in the addenda process.


The Recommended Budget represents an overall decrease of $48,085 or 37% in revenues and
a decrease of $10,431 or less than 1% in appropriations when compared to the FY 2012-13
approved budget. As a result, the Net County Cost is increased by $37,654 or 1% compared to
the FY 2012-13 approved budget.
The decrease in revenue is primarily related to charges for Land Management Information
System (LMIS) support billed to Transportation for work related to capital improvement projects.
The Surveyor’s FY 2012-13 budget included $70,000 for this work; however, no work was
required of the Surveyor during that time. Interfund revenues for FY 2013-14 have been
reduced accordingly. The Surveyor has reviewed other sources of revenue in the charges for
services category (fees for addressing, map checks, and certificates of compliance) and has
included an increase of $6,915 based on current trends and information coming from the
development community. The Surveyor will continue to monitor the needs and trends for
surveyor services LMIS support and will provide updated projections in the FY 2013-14 Budget
Addenda process.
Overall appropriations are decreasing by $10,431. Salaries and benefits are increasing by
$35,926 primarily due to changes in employee health insurance elections. As in FY 2012-13,
the budget includes $20,000 for extra help to address seasonal map checking work and to
assist GIS staff with data entry work associated General Plan Implementation efforts. Services
and supplies are increasing by $14,188 for costs associated with scanning equipment, office
supplies and staff development. Intrafund transfer appropriations are decreasing by $55,000 for
IT Programming costs associated with LMIS support for Transportation related projects. These
costs are not anticipated in FY 2013-14.
The Surveyor has requested fixed assets totaling $7,438, a decrease of $5,600 from
FY 2012-13. This funding includes $5,800 to upgrade the department’s current GPS mapping
unit to improve the accuracy of the unit from decimeter level (mapping grade) to centimeter level
accuracy (true survey grade), and $1,638 to replace an end of life laptop in the survey unit).
The Recommended Budget includes the reduction of one (1.0) FTE vacant GIS Technician and
the addition of one (1.0) FTE Office Assistant. This adjustment is necessary to true up the
department’s allocation and also offers a cost savings.


The Recommended Budget represents a decrease $49,118 or 6% in revenues and an increase
of $8,263 or less than 1% in appropriations when compared to the FY 2012-13 approved
budget. As a result, the Net County Cost is increased by $57,381 or 13%.
The change in revenue reflects decreases in Federal grant funding for the Noxious Weed
Program ($25,000) and an anticipated reduction in State unclaimed gas tax (UGT) funding
($22,210). The estimated UGT funding amount for FY 2013-14 is $289,554 and is based on the
actual amount received in FY 2012-13.
Overall appropriations remain relatively flat at $1,311,045, an increase of $8,263 over
FY 2012-13. Temporary employees and vehicle and fuel costs for the Noxious Weed Program
have been reduced due to the loss of funding for this program as noted above. The department
has been notified of grant funding that will be available in FY 2014-15 and anticipates being able
to return this program to FY 2012-13 levels.
The Recommended Budget includes funding for a Memorandum of Understanding with the
United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) for the provision of wildlife damage
management services ($34,130) approved by the Board in May 2013. These services were
previously provided by the USDA at no cost to the County and added the equivalent of 1.0 FTE
to assist with this program. However, budget reductions at the federal level have resulted in the
need for USDA to charge counties in order to continue the services. Services include both
urban/residential animal damage issues as well as protection of agricultural lands (livestock and
crops).
The department has reduced appropriations in a number of line items to help offset reductions
in revenues and the increase in costs for continued wildlife management services from the
USDA; however, further appropriation reductions would result in significant impacts to current
programs and are not recommended at this time.


In December 2012, the Board approved the formation of the Community Development Agency
and combined the former departments of Development Services, Environmental Management
and Transportation. The table below reflects the consolidated budget for the Agency:
The Recommended Budget for the Community Development Agency is $116,700,606, a
decrease of 14.2% in appropriations, with revenues of $112,465,184, a decrease of 15.1% from
FY 2012-13. Overall decreases are primarily related to a change in budgeting practice
regarding the appropriation of fund balances and revisions to the Transportation Division’s
Capital Improvement Program (CIP). Detailed explanations of the changes are included in the
discussion of each division budget (below).

The Net County Cost for the Agency is $4,235,422, an increase of $703,106. The increase in
Net County Cost is primarily associated with costs for the Long Range Planning unit within
Development Services that will be focused on General Plan implementation efforts, and costs in
the County Engineer program for the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES)
and the implementation of a Storm Water Management Plan as required by the Regional Water
Quality Control Board under the Statewide Phase II Storm Water permit.
The Agency also receives General Fund support in the form of contributions to the Road Fund
maintenance program and airport operations. Total General Fund contributions in FY 2013-14
are $2,551,965, an increase of $1,959,952 from the level of General Fund support included in
the FY 2012-13 budget. The increase is primarily for the increased contribution for road
maintenance as directed by the Board in February 2013 ($1,800,000) and an increase in the
contribution to the airports to complete the waterline project at the Placerville Airport to allow for
the future construction of additional hangers in order to help stimulate economic development
($172,000).
Recommended Staffing Changes:
The Community Development Agency (CDA) is requesting a number of personnel allocation
changes that are better aligned with current funding, administrative and programmatic
requirements. The proposed changes result in a net decrease of 2.0 FTEs. Changes include
the elimination of the former Assistant Director of Transportation and 1.0 Chief Fiscal Officer;
the transfer of 4 FTE Information Technology positions from CDA to the Information
Technologies Department; and the transfer of the River Recreation Supervisor position from
Environmental Management Division to the Chief Administrative Office Economic
Development/Parks/Trails Division. There are no anticipated reductions in force (RIF)
associated with the proposed deletions to the personnel allocations. All changes are detailed in
the Personnel Allocation table.
Development Services Division
The Recommended Budget for FY 2013-14 for the Development Services Division reflects the
reorganization of programs under the new Community Development Agency structure and
includes the centralization of all administrative and finance staff, and the consolidation and
expansion of the Agency’s Long Range Planning unit. The budgets for these programs are
included in the Development Services Division budget pending a reorganization within the
County’s financial system to accommodate the new Agency structure.

The Recommended Budget for Development Services represents an overall increase of
$4,984,770 or 153.7% in revenues and an increase of $5,723,778 or 95.6% in appropriations
when compared to the FY 2012-13 approved budget. As a result, the Net County Cost has
increased $739,008 or 26.9%. Overall increases are due to the inclusion of revenues and
appropriations for the new Community Development Agency’s Administration and Finance
Division and Long Range Planning unit.
Changes to revenues are primarily in charges for services ($3,664,380) and are related to the
cost recovery model that charges the Agency’s Administration and Finance Division expenses
to the other divisions within the Agency ($3,114,112) and charges for Long Range Planning
services to the Transportation Division for road fund and capital improvement projects
($415,931). Other revenue changes include an increase in building permit revenues based on
current year actuals ($36,829) and an increase in planning services time and material billings to
development projects ($7,996).
Expenditures are also increasing due to the inclusion of the Agency’s Administration and
Finance Division and Long Range Planning unit, primarily in salaries and benefits related to the
shifting of staff from other divisions ($4,495,900) and professional services for contracts
associated with Long Range Planning activities ($1,340,775). Other charges are increasing by
$477,461 which reflects the transfer of Agency IT staff to the County’s central Information
Technologies Department (4 FTEs); these employees will still perform services for the Agency
but the allocations will be transferred to IT and the employees’ time will be charged back to the
Agency. This transfer will allow for a more standardized support model for IT services, ensure
compliance with County standards, and provide cross training and appropriate back up for
critical IT support services needed by the Agency.
The Recommended Budget includes fixed assets totaling $19,656 for the purchase of a wide
format scanner and a wide format laser printer. This equipment will replace older leased
equipment when those leases expire. Analysis of purchasing vs. leasing showed that it was
more cost effective to purchase this equipment.

General Fund programs include: Administration, Environmental Health, and Hazardous
Materials—CUPA. The Recommended Budget represents an overall decrease of $390,005 or
15.1% in revenues and a decrease of $516,078 or 19.1% in appropriations when compared to
the FY 2012-13 approved budget. As a result, the Net County Cost has decreased by $126,073
and is now at zero.
The General Fund programs within Environmental Management are funded in part with garbage
franchise fees. These fees are estimated at $1.2M for FY 2013-14. These fees are
discretionary and can be utilized to fund any County costs. The FY 20113-14 budget includes
$275,000 of these fees in Department 15 to fund countywide Net County Cost with the
remaining $962,286 funding Environmental Management programs. 

The FY 2013-14 Recommended Budget for these programs includes a total revenue decrease
of $390K and a decrease in appropriations of $516,078. These decreases are related to the
transfer of administrative and finance staff and support from the Environmental Management
Division to the central Community Development Agency Administration and Finance Division.

The non-general fund programs within Environmental Management include South Lake Tahoe
Vector Control/Snow Removal (CSA #3), Household Hazardous Waste/Incident Response
(CSA #10), Solid Waste, and Liquid Waste.
There is no Net County Cost associated with these programs. Revenues and appropriations
have decreased $3.03 million. This decrease is associated with the full appropriation of fund
balance in FY 2012-13 and the corresponding appropriation for designated fund balance not
anticipated to be used in that year. This was a one-time event to accommodate a change in
budgeting practice regarding fund balance.

Within the General Fund programs in the Transportation Division, the Recommended Budget
represents an increase of $477,453 or 53% in revenues and an increase of $567,624 or 36.3%
in appropriations when compared to the FY 2012-13 approved budget. As a result, the Net
County Cost is increased by $90,171 or 14%. The increase in revenues and appropriations is
primarily related to costs for the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES)
program.

County Engineer (includes National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System - NPDES)
The Recommended Budget for County Engineer includes an increase in appropriations of
$617,029 and an increase in revenues of $477,453 resulting in an increase in Net County Cost
of $139,576. Total Net County Cost for this program is $735,973. The increase is related to
changes in the NPDES program to meet requirements of the permit issued to the County related
to stormwater runoff; an estimated increase for County Engineer support for projects the
Transportation Planning & Land Development unit anticipates in FY 2013-14; and additional
billable work related to subdivision activity.
Within the General Fund, Public Utility Franchise Fees are utilized to fund half of the NPDES
program. It is important to note that the Public Utility Franchise Fees are a discretionary source
of revenue and can be spent on any County function. These funds used to be part of a
Maintenance of Effort (MOE) related to our Prop 42 funds. However with the recent tax swap
the new Highway Users Tax Account (HUTA) funds do not require the MOE. The division
anticipates approximately $1M annually in Public Utility Franchise Fees. The table below
summarizes the recommended use of these funds in FY 2013-14.

The Recommended Budget for Cemetery operations includes a decrease in appropriations of
$49,405 and no change in revenue resulting in a Net County Cost decrease of $49,405. This
decrease is due the shift of administration and finance support to the Community Development
Administration and Finance Unit.
Special Revenue Fund – Fund Type 11
The Recommended Budget represents an increase of $18,372,707 or 17.9% in revenue and
appropriations when compared to the FY 2012-13 approved budget. The budget includes a
General Fund contribution of $2.3 million for the road maintenance program (an increase of $1.8
million as directed by the Board of Supervisors on February 5, 2013).

The Special Revenue Fund budget is comprised of Road Fund Operations, Road Capital
Improvement Program, Road District Taxes, Erosion Control, Placerville Union Cemetery, and
Special Aviation. The chart below details the total revenues, appropriations and use of fund
balance included in the Recommended Budget for FY 2013-14.

Road Fund Operations includes the Maintenance Division, Transportation Planning and Land
Development, and Engineering functions. The Recommended Budget includes a decrease in
revenues of $3,551,832 and a decrease in appropriations of $8,174,776 when compared to the
current year budget. These decreases are primarily related to a change in budgeting practice in
FY 2012-13 wherein the full amount of available fund balance was recognized in the budget with
a corresponding appropriation to designated fund balance for the amount of fund balance that
would not be spent in that year. In FY 2013-14, the budgeted use of fund balance is decreased
by $4,662,944 and appropriations for designations of fund balance have been reduced
accordingly. The recommended use of Fund Balance from Designations in FY 2013-14 is
$3,457,586. As a result, the projected fund balance in the Road Fund at June 20, 1014 is $7.22
million and in the Road District Tax fund is $240,000. In the near term, it is anticipated that
these funds will be needed to help sustain the current level of service in the next two to three
years. It should be noted that fund balance is a one-time revenue source and the division will
need to identify new revenues or sustainable savings to fund operations in the long term.
A General Fund contribution to the road fund of $2,300,000 is included in the Recommended
Budget, an increase of $1.8 million over FY 2012-13. It is estimated that approximately 85 miles
of roadway will be chip sealed, see listing attached for proposed roads.
In an effort to reduce costs the division is proposing to leave thirteen (13) vacant positions in the
Road Fund unfunded during the upcoming year. We want to retain all allocations specifically to
allow Community Development Agency management the time to analyze the structure of the
Transportation Division and to allow for future hiring if needed for the implementation of the
restructuring.

The Recommended Budget for the Road Fund Capital Improvement Program (CIP) represents
a decrease of $4,981,657 in revenues and appropriations when compared to the FY 2012-13
approved budget. This budget fluctuates depending on the Board approved CIP. Funding and
appropriations are consistent with the Proposed 2013 CIP and is based on a per project basis.
The FY 2013-14 budget does anticipate using $1,747,635 in road fund balance for the Capital
Improvement Program.
Major projects scheduled for construction during FY 2013-14 include:
 US 50 HOV Lane – Phase 0
 Missouri Flat I/C Phase 1C
 US 50 / Silva Valley Interchange
 Diamond Springs Parkway Phase 1A
 Northside School Bike Path
 Hollow Oak Drainage
 Green Valley Road Signal Interconnect
 Pleasant Valley/Oak Hill intersection
 Pleasant Valley/Patterson intersection
 Green Valley/Deer Valley intersection
 Silver Springs Parkway and Green Valley/Silver Springs Parkway intersection
 Latrobe Road safety project
 Rubicon Ellis Creek Bridge
 Mt. Aukum Road at the North Fork of the Cosumnes River
 Cosumnes Mine Road at the North Fork of the Cosumnes River
 Sly Park Road Clear Creek Crossing
 Cold Springs Realignment
 Salmon Falls Realignment, Francisco Drive Right-Turn Pocket and overlay
 El Dorado Trail Extension to Halcon
The Tahoe Environmental Improvement Program (EIP) is included in the division’s
Proposed 2013 CIP program and the budget is being submitted consistent with that document.
The Tahoe program is funded through available grant funds primarily USFS, CMAQ, CTC, and
TRPA mitigation funds. There is no cost to the General Fund for this program.
Projects scheduled for construction include:
 Boulder Mountain
 Montgomery Estates Area 2
 Lake Tahoe Boulevard Bike Trail
 Christmas Valley Phase 2C
 and Sawmill Bike Path Phase 2B

Special Districts provides for the activities of County Service Areas 2, 3, 5, and 9, Zones of
Benefit, and the Georgetown Cemetery Zone. Areas and zones are established to provide road
and drainage maintenance, lighting, cemetery services and other localized services to a specific
area. Special Districts is primarily funded by taxes and special assessments to benefiting
parcels.
The Recommended Budget represents a decrease of $3,289,326 or 44.7% in revenue and
appropriations when compared to the FY 2012-13 approved budget. This decrease is primarily
due to the decrease in revenues from the use of fund balance and appropriations offsetting
appropriations to fund balance designations that occurred in FY 2012-13.
Airports /South Lake Tahoe Transit – Fund Type 31
The Airports are included in what is referred to as an Enterprise Fund. In governmental
accounting an Enterprise Fund is defined as a fund that provides goods or services to the public
for a fee that makes the entity self-supporting.
Both the Placerville and Georgetown Airports continue to require General Fund contributions to
sustain operations. Staff continues to explore alternatives to reaching sustainable operations
including a possible fee increase (fees were increased three years ago but the rates are still
lower than similar facilities in the area), alternative staffing patterns, and capital improvements
to provide additional hangers (see below).
The Recommended Budget represents a decrease of $441,648 or 18.8% in revenues and
appropriations when compared to the FY 2012-13 approved budget. This change is primarily
related to a decrease in the proposed Airport Capital Improvement program which can fluctuate
from year to year.
The Recommended Budget includes a General Fund Contribution of $251,965 to the Airport
programs for the following:
$172,000 for construction of a waterline which will accommodate additional hangers to
the Placerville Airport for increased economic development. This contribution was
approved by the Board at its meeting on December 18, 2012.
 $79,965 to fund the ongoing operations of the airports. An amount representative of the
property taxes generated by the airports is included as part of this request; Placerville
Airport - $30,631 and Georgetown Airport - $6,175. The remaining $43,159 is to sustain
the current operations of the Georgetown Airport.
Fleet – Fund Type 32
Fleet Services manages the planning, acquisition, and replacement of County vehicles, as well
as the sale or disposal of surplus vehicles and manages the fleet pool. Additionally, this unit
provides auto maintenance and repair services for County vehicles. Fleet Services receives
funding primarily from charges to County departments to recover costs of maintaining,
operating, and replacement of the fleet.
The Recommended Budget represents a decrease of $1,058 or less than 1% in revenues and
appropriations when compared to the FY 2012-13 approved budget. This budget includes an
appropriation for the purchase of 24 replacement vehicles, of which 9 are for the Sheriff’s
Department, for a total cost of $723,000. These vehicles are anticipated to exceed the
replacement target mileage by December 2013.


The Fish and Game Commission has the following goals for FY 2013-14:
 Continue to support the Department of Fish & Game in restoring fish stocking in El
Dorado County waters currently restricted by the order imposed as a result of the lawsuit
filed by the Pacific Rivers Council and the Center for Biological Diversity.
 Expand a local sportsman education program on problems caused by invasive species.
 Develop local K-9 Sponsorship and support for the California Fish & Game detection dog
program.
 Play an active role in the restoration of the fishery at Finnon Lake.
 Continue to work on the development and expansion of the Central Sierra Fish & Game
Commissions Association. This group is fostering improved communication and problem
solving on a regional level.
 Obtain increases in hatchery fish allocation and funding
 Continue to develop partnerships and support for the youth fishing project at Sawmill
Pond and advocate for expanded fishing opportunities in the Tahoe basin.


The Recommended Budget for the Public Health Division of the Health & Human Services
Agency is $47,630,523 with a Net County Cost of $1,281,649 for Animal Services and a
General Fund contribution of $4,341,331 for other programs (see detail in Source of Funds
section above).
Animal Services – General Fund
The Recommended Budget for Animal Services represents an increase of $29,953 or 2% in
revenues and an increase of $121,952 or 5% in appropriations when compared to the FY 2012-
13 approved budget. As a result, the Net County Cost is increased by $91,996 or 8%.
The increase in revenues is primarily associated with each of the city’s contribution for shared
expenditures. There is also an anticipated increase of revenue from Department of
Transportation. While Animal Services is showing an increase of revenues in these areas, there
is a decrease of revenues in licensing and sales tax.
Expenditures have also increased because of an additional half-time Senior Office Assistant
($14,000), increase of Extra Help Veterinarian hours ($31,000), Retirement and Health
Insurance Costs ($46,700). These increases were offset by other changes in the salaries and
benefits including new hire staffing changes, benefit election changes and decreased
unemployment insurance costs (-$32,500). As a result, the increase in salaries and benefits is
$59,200.
Expenditures increased by $7,000 for the purchase of safety vests for the Animal Control
Officers on the field. Additional expenditures estimated to increase are related to the Animal
Services West Slope Shelter construction project in the amount of $22,000. Operations
continue to be impacted by the need to operate out of multiple West Slope facilities. Staff will
continue to coordinate with CAO (Facilities) to support the shelter project activities as may be
approved by the Board.
Fixed Assets:
An anticipated decrease of $14,245 in fixed assets is related to replacing the fixed assets in FY
2012-13 rather than in FY 2013-14. There is an anticipated cost to replace one laptop computer
in FY 2013-14 ($2,000).
Recommended Staffing Changes:
Animal Services will be increasing by a half-time Senior Office Assistant.
Public Health– Fund Type 11
The Recommended Budget for Public Health programs has decreased $668,423 or 2.6%.
These decreases are primarily from reductions in federal funding in Preparedness programs
and Alcohol Drug programs (ADP) as well as the completion of a number of grant funded

programs in FY 2012-13. The budget includes a General Fund contribution of $4,341,331 for
various programs (see detail in Source of Funds section above).
There are decreases in appropriations primarily relate to the reduction of Services and Supplies
in the ADP and Preparedness Programs ($668,638).
Fixed Assets:
Public Health Fund Type 11 has requested a number of fixed asset items for Public Health
programs totaling $63,275. The items are detailed in the Uses of Funds section above and are
funded primarily by realignment funds. Included are share of costs with Human Services at
multiple office locations; computer equipment replacement and furniture for office redesign.
Recommended Staffing Changes:
The Health Services Department is requesting position changes that better align personnel
allocations with the current funding, administrative and programmatic requirements of the
Department. The changes to personnel allocations are a result of changes due to the merging
of Health Services and Human Services. Position changes are detailed on the Personnel
Allocation table and are funded by Special Revenue Funding and do not result in an increase to
Net County Cost.
CSA #3, CSA #7 and Ambulance Billing – Fund Type 12
The Recommended Budget for the CSA programs has decreased by $1,148,866 or 5.43%.
Revenues for CSA #3 and CSA #7 pre-hospital medical services and ambulance billing
programs include charges for services (primarily ambulance services), assessments and taxes;
and contract payments from the Miwok Tribe. The decrease in revenue is primarily due to a
decrease in residual equity transfer for CSA #7 that happened in FY 2012-13 and a decrease of
2% in Medicare payments. Fund balance has decreased by $536,596 in Public Health Fund
Type 12. Decreases to appropriations have been made to reflect the corresponding decrease
of the use of fund balance in FY 2013-14. Property tax revenues are estimated to remain the
same as FY 2012-13. Revenues from ambulance service charges are expected to decrease by
$60,000.
The Department has developed a multi-year forecasting tool for use by the West Slope and
Cal-Tahoe JPAs and staff to work collaboratively in developing and maintaining an annual
balanced operational budget for the CSAs. The forecasting tool enables the Department and
the JPAs to incorporate assumptions about revenues and expenditures to clearly show the
amount of any fund balance required in each year and the longer term impact of the use of such
fund balance. The forecasting tool assumes revenue from the Miwok Tribe. It should be noted
the contract between El Dorado County and the Miwok Tribe is currently under negotiation. For
CSA #3 and CSA #7, the Five Year Forecast shows a required use (depletion) of fund balance
in the current and future fiscal years:

The CSA #7 forecast above indicates a structural budget problem of approximately $700,000
per year when one-time expenditures are excluded. If the current revenue and expenditure
trends continue, fund balance will be used each year and ultimately depleted. The contract
between the County and the West Slope JPA requires that a minimum fund balance of
$3,000,000 be maintained in CSA #7 unless a reduced amount is approved by the County
Board of Supervisors. This amount is included in the forecast with no reductions.


The total Recommended Budget for the Mental Health programs is $24,744,831, an increase of
$490,983 or 2.0% when compared to the FY 2012-13 adopted budget. There is a General Fund
contribution of $16,510 for County match requirements.
Traditional Mental Health Programs
The Recommended Budget for Traditional Mental Health Programs is $10,903,374 and
represents an overall decrease of $1,572,231 or 12.6% when compared to the FY 2012-13
adopted budget. Traditional Mental Health programs are primarily funded by federal revenues
($3,185,832), realignment revenues ($5,395,044) and charges for services to other counties
and private payers ($1,152,023).
The Division has continued to focus on mandated and contractually obligated services, set
service priorities to fit within available revenues, and transition services from a medical/
institutional model to a wellness and recovery-oriented model in its MHSA programs. However,
despite these efforts, the budget for Traditional Mental Health programs is not structurally
balanced and will require the use of Fund Balance of $686,486 to sustain ongoing operating
costs and Tobacco Settlement Funding of $200,000 to pay for one-time costs, including moving
expenses. If current revenue and expenditure trends continue, fund balance will be used and
ultimately depleted by FY 2014-15. The Division continues to monitor this situation and will
provide further information at the FY 2013-14 Mid-Year reporting interval.
Inpatient Services:
The Division has experienced an increase in the number of clients requiring inpatient services
and expects to see that trend continue in FY 2013-14. The 10-bed PHF facility is regularly full,
which then requires the use of contracted facilities in which to place our County’s clients. The
PHF is in the process of expanding to a licensed, sixteen bed facility. The Division was required
to submit a patient care plan to the State Department of Social Services and it has been
approved. The construction contract has been finalized and the Division is in the process of
developing construction time frames. The completion of this project is anticipated to correlate
closely with the beginning of FY 2013-14. Although the County of El Dorado’s residents receive
first priority for required admissions, the Division contracts with several other counties to provide
their residents with inpatient care on an as needed, as available, basis. We anticipate a
significant increase in revenues for the PHF in FY 2013-14, both for additional billings to other
counties for inpatient care, as well as increased billings to private insurance.
In Fiscal Year 2012-2013, the Division acquired the use of two hospital beds from the California
Department of State Hospitals (see BOS Resolution 134-2012 dated September 25, 2012).
The payments for the hospital beds are paid with 1991 Realignment as an “offset to revenue”
and the payment is based on a minimum commitment made by the Division. For example, if the
Division requested two beds, the Division would be funding two beds regardless of whether
there is only one client utilizing a bed thereby leaving the other bed vacant. The expenditure is
projected to be approximately $450,000 ($225,000 per State hospital bed). In the next several
weeks, the MHD will be recommending the Board of Supervisors approve an MOU with the
State related to the utilization of the hospital beds.
Services to the Juvenile Hall and the Juvenile Treatment Center:
The Juvenile Hall is currently assigned a 0.75 FTE Mental Health Clinician to serve minors in
the facility. The JTC is currently allocated a 0.4 FTE Mental Health Clinician and has additional
outside contract services for drug and alcohol counseling. Mental health services are funded by
a combination of State funds, grant funds and General Fund support passed through the
Probation Department. The Probation Department has included $50,000 in their FY 2013-14
budget to partially fund the current level of mental health services; however, a funding gap of
approximately $140,000 still remains. Mental Health uses its realignment funds to cover this
budget gap. Probation and Mental Health will be reviewing the current MOU to determine
applicable staffing needed for required service levels in FY 2013-14. Should additional fund
balance be available from the General Fund, it is recommended that funding be appropriated in
the Addenda process to enable Probation to allow for review of existing service levels provided
by Mental Health.
Ancillary Medical Costs:
A potential issue for the Health Services Department in FY 2013-14 is the payment of ancillary
mental health and medical services received by patients within Institutions for Mental Diseases
(IMDs). In FY 09-10 the California Department of Health Care Services (DHCS) and the DMH
issued written documentation announcing a shift in financial responsibility for those ancillary
services from the State to the counties. These ancillary services may include the cost of
prescribed medications, off-site x-rays, lab, or hospital services, etc. The State is indicating its
intent to bill the counties for any such services that may have been provided and billed to Medi-
Cal. Counties do not yet have information relative to the amounts in question. Some counties
have filed a petition to the State Office of Administrative Law requesting a determination that the
DHCS and DMH communication be declared as invalid, underground regulations. The Division
continues to monitor this situation and will provide further information to County Counsel relative
to legal and fiscal impacts as it becomes available.
New Legislation:
Senate Bill (SB) 1020 which accompanies the 2012 Budget Act went into effect June 28, 2012.
This bill establishes a permanent financial and account structure for 2011 Realignment. The
Legislature made a number of changes to realign certain state program responsibilities and
revenues to counties. Two major mental health programs previously funded, in part, through
the Department of Mental Health (DMH) were realigned as part of the 2011-12 budget package.
The major realigned mental health programs include Mental Health Managed Care (MHMC) and
Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment (EPSDT). Under realignment, in 2011-
12 $763 million of Proposition 63 funds was redirected in lieu of State General Fund on a onetime
basis to support MHMC ($184 million) and EPSDT ($579 million). Beginning in 2012-13,

MHMC and EPSDT were mainly funded with a combination of funds from the 2011 realignment
revenues and federal matching funds and will continue to be through FY 2013-14.
Senate Bill (SB) 1009 went into effect June 27, 2012. This bill includes changes to state laws
governing Medi-Cal Specialty Health to effectuate its 2013-13 realignment to counties.
Assembly Bill (AB) 1494 – went into effect June 27, 2012. This bill eliminates the Healthy
Families Program (HFP) entirely and transfers all beneficiaries to Medi-Cal (including Early and
Periodic Screening, Diagnosis and Treatment (EPSDT)) over four phases beginning January 1,
2013.
Mental Health Services Act (MHSA) Programs
The Recommended Budget for MHSA Programs is $13,841,456 and represents an overall
increase of $2,063,213 or 17.5% when compared to the FY 2012-13 adopted budget. The
primary reason for the increase is due to an anticipated increase in MHSA funding for FY 2013-
14 as compared to the FY 2012-13 budgeted amounts. FY 2012-13 MHSA revenue received
was much greater than budgeted and we expect to see similar revenues for FY 2013-14.
MHSA programs are funded primarily by MHSA funds ($6,025,786), but also include federal
revenues ($1,173,050) for MHSA clients who are eligible under Medi-Cal programs.
Fixed Assets:
The Division is requesting a number of fixed asset items totaling $175,755. Of this amount,
$52,000 is for video conferencing equipment for telemedicine programs included in and funded
by the MHSA Capital Facilities and Technological Needs (CFTN) component. Other items are
related to the PHF expansion to 16 beds; including $14,973 for construction costs, $12,830 for
painting, $22,277 for new access control system, and $33,995 for new video surveillance
system. The additional items are detailed in the Uses of Funds section above.
Recommended Staffing Changes:
The Health Services Department is requesting a number of position additions/deletions that
better align personnel allocations with the current funding, administrative and programmatic
requirements of the Department. The changes to personnel allocations result in a net increase
to the overall FTEs for the Department over FY 2012-13. Position changes are detailed on the
Personnel Allocation table.


The proposed budget for Human Services is comprised of $61,354,776 in appropriations and
$59,417,552 in revenues, resulting in a Net County Cost request totaling $1,937,224 and a
General Fund Contribution Request totaling $1,768,218, an overall increase of approximately
$17,000 from the level of General Fund support included in the adopted FY 2012-13 budget.
Human Services anticipates significant changes to its programs and budget over the next 12 –
18 months primarily as a result of the implementation of the Affordable Care Act and the 2013
Federal Budget Sequester. Unfortunately, at this time the impact of these changes is unknown.
The CAO’s Office will work with Human Services to closely monitor the impact of these
changes, and any impacts will be addressed in the budget addenda process.
The following is a summary of the primary issues impacting Human Services’ FY 2013-14
budget:
Affordable Care Act
Beginning in Fiscal Year 2013-14, individuals wishing to purchase health insurance will be able
to enroll in subsidized plans offered through state-based exchanges, with coverage beginning
January 2014. At this time, the State is still in the process of determining how the ‘Exchange’
will function. Depending on the direction the State takes, it may result in additional staffing
needs in order to meet the anticipated increase in workload, as well as the amount of funding, if
any, that will be provided to local jurisdictions.
As a result, Human Services did not include any staffing changes in the recommended budget
relative to the Affordable Care Act. It is anticipated that additional staffing will be requested in
the budget addenda process as additional information becomes available over the next few
months.
Impacts of Budget Control Act of 2011 – Federal Sequestration 2013:
As a result of the Budget Control Act of 2011, effective March 1, 2013, the Federal Government
implemented funding reductions that impact programs within Human Services. While the full
impact is not know at this time, preliminary analysis is reflecting Community Services programs
(Human Services Fund Type 11) may have reductions in Federal funding of approximately
$192,500 if the cuts are across the board and remain in effect for the entire Fiscal Year.
In addition, the sequestration cuts to the Public Housing Authority (Human Services Fund Type
12) may result in a decrease in funding of an estimated 5.9% for Housing Choice Voucher
Assistance and a reduction in administration fees of approximately 31.5%. At this time the
Public Housing Authority has a sufficient reserve balance, although it is declining, and has not
been identified by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) as
‘shortfall’ County. As a result, the Housing Authority continues to issue vouchers in order to
maintain its preferred status with HUD. However, the reserve balance is being monitored by
Human Services and depending on the ongoing impact of the sequester reductions it may be
necessary to terminate some vouchers in the future in order to prevent an impact to the General
Fund Contribution.
Housing, Community, and Economic Development (HCED) Programs Transfer to CAO’s Office:
The Health and Human Services Agency has been working with the CAO’s Office relative to the
role of HCED programs and where those programs will be most beneficial, and are
recommending the HCED programs be transferred to the CAO in order to work closely with
Economic Development. As a result of these changes, the General Fund Contribution totaling
approximately $176,000 is anticipated to be transferred from Community Services to the CAO
with addenda.
Impact of Reduction of Targeted Case Management (TCM) Revenue:
TCM is administered by the California Department of Health Care Services and leverages
allowable State and local revenue to receive federal reimbursement for approved case
management services. TCM Revenues received by Public Guardian are estimated to decrease
by $20,000 in FY 2013-14 from the prior Fiscal Year. This reduction is due to a reduced client
encounter rate from $1,261 to $922, primarily resulting from the shifting of County Counsel
costs included in the A-87 Cost Allocation plan to a miscellaneous cost category.
As a reminder, in FY 2012-13, the Board of Supervisors approved an additional three positions
in the Public Guardian’s office with the assumption that the Net County Cost would be $253,039
and would decrease in future years as TCM reimbursable activities increased with additional
staffing. The result of this decrease in the TCM encounter rate reduces the revenue projections
and combined with an increase in appropriations resulting from the Agency’s technology refresh
plan and increased utility costs, the Public Guardian is requesting an ongoing increase in the
General Fund Contribution totaling $55,372.

Aging and Adult Continuum of Care Programs
The Health and Human Services Agency is requesting an increase to the level of General Fund
support of approximately $137,500 to support the Aging and Adult Continuum of Care programs
in Human Services (which include but are not limited to Senior Nutrition, Senior Legal,
Ombudsman, Information & Referral services, Elder Abuse, Senior Day Care, Multipurpose
Senior Services Program, and Public Guardian):
 The Aging programs increase to General Fund Contribution of $66,916 is primarily due
to: an increase of approximately $82,200 in Salary and Benefit costs mainly in PERS
and Healthcare, resulting from changes in staffing and for compliance with program
requirements; a $5,000 increase in fixed assets for programmatic software system
replacement as the case management system currently used by the programs has
reached its end of life and is no longer supported by the software developer; a $10,000
increase in costs related to the IT project management and the annual software
maintenance costs of the new case management system; and a $2,000 steam table
replacement for Senior Nutrition. Human Services is working with IT to evaluate the
business needs of a new case management system and anticipates releasing a Request
for Proposal to replace this system in the near future (the total costs of approximately
$25,000 for system replacement, project management, and maintenance will be split
across Aging programs, Senior Day Care, and MSSP).
 The Senior Day Care (SDC) program increase in General Fund Contribution of $15,202
is primarily due to: additional 1.08 FTE staffing required for compliance with staff to client
ratios due to the increase in client daily attendance; a $3,000 increase in fixed assets for
programmatic software system replacement (as noted above); and a $2,000 increase in
costs related to the IT project management and the annual software maintenance costs
of the new case management system. These increases will be partially offset by an
increase in revenue totaling approximately $55,000 as a result of increased client
attendance.
 The Public Guardian Net County Cost increase of $55,372 from the prior fiscal year is
primarily due to: a $20,000 decrease in Targeted Case Management (TCM) revenues; a
$9,200 increase for technology refresh plan implementation; a $9,000 increase in
salaries and benefit costs; and $14,000 in increased utilities costs at its new location.
Historically, the practice in the Community Services Division’s Aging program has been to
‘defer’ a portion of the current year revenue received from Senior Nutrition, Senior Activities,
and Senior Legal donations to the following fiscal year instead of realizing the revenue in the
fiscal year received, thus impacting the General Fund Contribution to these
programs. Beginning FY 2012-13, the Aging Programs will be realizing this revenue in the year
it was received. As a result, the Aging programs will end FY 2012-13 with a General Fund
Contribution savings of approximately $230,000. Human Services has included the deferred
revenues are included in the FY 2013-14 budget. Human Services will continue to analyze the
impact of this accounting change and may make adjustments during the budget addenda
process at which time the Aging programs may be requesting additional funding to continue the
ongoing support of these programs.
Recommended Staffing Changes:
Human Services is requesting position changes that better align personnel allocations with the
current funding, administrative and programmatic requirements of the Department. Position
changes are detailed on the Personnel Allocation table, the majority of which are funded with
Federal, State and Realignment funding. The significant changes impacting the General Fund
are relative to the Aging and Adult Continuum of Care programs.

The Recommended Budget represents an overall decrease of $40,823 or 45% in revenues and
a decrease of $45,532 or 11% in appropriations when compared to the FY 2012-13 approved
budget. As a result, the Net County Cost has decreased $4,709 or 1%.
The decrease in revenues is due to a decrease in the Veteran license plate special revenues of
$35K. The department had built up approximately $45K in fund balance. This fund balance has
been depleted over the last few years. The annual new revenue in this funds is approximately
$10K/
The decrease in appropriations is primarily related to a correction to health insurance costs. It
appears that the health insurance costs were inadvertently doubled in the FY 2012-13 budget.
The Recorder-Clerk/Registrar of Voters continues to act as the department head for Veteran
Affairs.


The Recommended Budget represents an overall decrease of $98,489 or 5.2% in revenues and
a decrease of $76,933 or 2.3% in appropriations when compared to the FY 2012-13 approved
budget. As a result, the Net County Cost has increased $22,016 or 1.5%.
Revenue from the transfer of fund balance from the various library zones is budgeted at
$1,383,860, a reduction of $34,370 from FY 2012-13. This reduction is consistent with the
department’s planned use of library zone fund balance for the next three fiscal years. Revenues
are also decreasing due to reductions in donations from the Friends of the Library ($59,281).
As donations are received, they will be brought to the Board for acceptance and added to the
budget at that time. Grant funding from First 5 El Dorado is included in the department’s
Recommended Budget at the same amount as FY 2012-13 ($212,500). These grant funds are
used to support early literacy programs.
Expenditures are decreasing, primarily in the areas of salaries & benefits ($36,382) as the
department strives to re-assign staff when vacancies occur and reduce the number of FTEs;
services & supplies are decreasing primarily in book materials ($39,833) related to the reduction
in donation revenues noted above.
The department is requesting a number of position changes resulting in an overall decrease of
0.55 FTEs. The following position changes are recommended to adjust for current vacancies
and improve operational efficiencies at each of the branch libraries:

The Recommended Budget represents and overall increase in revenues and appropriations of
$421,021 or 7.9%. There is no Net County Cost for Child Support Services.
The department’s State/Federal funding allocation for FY 2013-14 Child Support Administration
activities remains at $4,747,119 and consists of 1) a base allocation of $4,578,589 and
2) revenue stabilization augmentation funds of $168,530 dedicated to programs that maximize
the probability of success in Child Support collections. The augmentation funding is part of the
local assistance base budget and is not a one-time augmentation. These funds are directed to
an “early intervention” program within the Department. Early intervention has been proven to be
effective in both increasing collections and improving performance measures. The State
allocation for the Electronic Data Processing Maintenance and Operations (EDP/MO) program
is anticipated to be $180,258, the same level as FY 2012-13.
Revenues for the Revenue Recovery Division are increasing $306,442 or 57%. This increase
is related to new collection activity as follows:
Delinquent Formal Probation Cases
Revenue Recovery began collecting on delinquent formal probation cases in
April 2013 and expects to significantly increase the collections on those accounts.
Formal probation debtors typically have committed a serious crime, and owe victim

restitution, court, and county fines and fees. Improved collections on those cases
benefits residents of the county who have been harmed financially by criminals and
improves the collection of fees owed to both probation and the public defender’s
offices which results in improved financial status for those departments. Revenue
Recovery’s collection of those fees also frees up probation officers, allowing them
to manage other aspects of those criminals’ probation conditions. There are
approximately 2700 delinquent formal probation cases, owing tens of thousands of
dollars each which will eventually be referred to Revenue Recovery. In addition to
the current caseload, the Court has advised they expect the department to receive
40 to 60 new formal probation cases each month.
Summary Probation Cases
Revenue Recovery is also taking on collections for Summary Probation cases and
there are approximately 68,000 cases which will eventually be referred. Debts
owed by these lower level criminal cases are owed for misdemeanor offenses.
Victim Restitution
Revenue Recovery recently began offering services to victims whose victim
restitution is still owed and unpaid post-probation. Only a few victims have
requested the service so far, but the numbers will increase as the District
Attorney’s Victim Witness Office sends applications to 795 victims who previously
had no other collection remedy and fall into this debt category.
Ambulance Debt
The Health and Human Services Agency (HHSA) has approached the department
about possible collection of ambulance debt. As of February 2013 there were
approximately 7766 cases with unpaid ambulance debt totaling $6,649,631.
Discussion is currently underway to consider taking on a portion of these
collections.
Salaries and benefits are increasing by $374,617. This increase is primarily associated with a
request to increase staffing in the Revenue Recovery Division to manage the additional
collection workload noted above ($242,280) and increases in health insurance costs
($123,787). The department has continued to include a projected salary savings in the Child
Support Division based on current vacancy rates ($154,095).
Services and supplies are increasing by $43,480 primarily for the purchase of an upgraded
software program to replace the current outdated collections system in the Revenue Recovery
Division ($39,140). This software will improve the department’s ability to work cases, run
reports and better facilitate conversion to the County’s Enterprise Resource Program (ERP).
Personnel allocations for the department are recommended at 66.0 FTEs, an increase of
2.0 FTEs over FY 2012-13. The department is requesting the following position changes
related to the new collections workload noted above:

El Dorado County Child Support Services was identified by the State as a top performing
county, rated #5 out of the 58 California Counties for Federal Fiscal Year 2012 with total
collections of $13.3 million at the end of September 2012. Additionally, the Revenue Recovery
Division anticipates collecting approximately $3 million in revenues in FY 2012-13 for the
agencies and departments they serve. Of that $3 million, collections for County departments
are projected at $108,000 and offset costs in those departments. A portion of those
collections is retained by Revenue Recovery to offset direct program costs resulting in a zero
Net County Cost budget for the program.
