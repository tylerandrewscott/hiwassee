The Recommended Budget for the County Administrative Office is
$53,311,074, an increase of $4,176,073, or 8%. This is due to an
increase in Other Financing Uses, which reflects an increase in

revenues) available for distribution to various County programs
and activities.
Recommended General Fund revenues are $181,013,675, an
increase of $7,640,818, or 4%. The increase is due to increases in
tax revenue; use of money & property revenue; intergovernmental
revenues; and miscellaneous revenues. These increases offset
significant decreases in licenses, permits, and franchises revenue ($
1,395,618); fines, forfeitures, and penalties revenue ($113,080);
charges for other services ($178,105); and other financing

CONTRIBUTIONS - PROPOSITION 172: The County
contributes a portion of its Public Safety Sales Tax (Proposition
172) revenue to fire protection service providers in unincorporated
areas of the County. For FY 2011-12, the County Administrative
Office and the Association agreed to a new negotiated
disbursement model for Proposition 172 revenues. Beginning in
FY 2011-12, the County will share with the Association the full
9.13% of Proposition 172 revenues for the most recently audited
fiscal year (e.g., the FY 2012-13 allocation will be 9.13% of FY 2010-
11 audited actuals). Under this formula, the Association's share of
Proposition 172 revenues will increase by $241,914 to $2,478,544 in
FY 2013-14. Similar to the new agreement with emergency
communications user agencies, the new allocation methodology
ties future allocations to audited actuals, resulting in greater

HOMELAND SECURITY GRANT PROGRAM: A critical
component of the Office of Emergency Services (OES) grant
programs for homeland security-related activities is the Emergency
Management Performance Grant (EMPG). This grant funding
supports the need and enhances the capabilities of public safety
first responders (police, fire, and emergency medical services),
public health, and emergency management to prevent, protect,
mitigate, and respond and recover from terrorist attacks, major
disasters, and other emergencies. These funds are spend
exclusively on related local planning, organization, acquisition of
equipment, training (including large scale exercises), and
administrative management of the grant. The grant funding is
matched 50/50 with County General Funds. The funding is
managed as reimbursable grants, requiring the County to first incur
the costs for equipment, supplies, and personnel and then be
reimbursed by the State. In any given fiscal year, OES manages
three grant cycles with over $1,000,000 in obligated funds.

Employee Relations and Human Resources units to address service
delivery needs related to managing a comprehensive labor and
employee relations function, and coordinating the BOS-directed
recentralization of the County's human resources functions.

eliminated for the Countywide Educational Assistance Program,
the Countywide Employee Recognition Program, and funds for the
maintenance, repair and/or replacement of computers and related
equipment, employee training, and the purchase of most office
supplies.The Recommended Budget for FY 2013-14 is $3,227,471, a 23.5%
increase over FY 2012-13. The increased budget is due to: the
addition of a Principal Employee Relations Representative position,
the addition of an Assistant Human Resources Director position, a
GFC transfer from the Sheriff's Department to support 1.5 FTE as
part of the HR centralization effort, $120,000 to fund labor
relations consulting work, and a $217,000 GFC supplement in the
Employee Benefits unit to replace funds formerly charged to
County departments.
Budget Impacts
EMPLOYEE RELATIONS: The FY 2013-14 Recommended Budget
for Employee Relations is $466,923, a 45.9% increase from FY 2012-
13 due to the addition of a 1.0 FTE Principal Employee Relations
Representative position, $120,000 for labor relations consulting
work.
HUMAN RESOURCES: The 16.7% increase indicated above
reflects the addition of 1.0 FTE Assistant Director of Human
Resources, a 1.0 FTE Personnel Technician-Confidential and
additional funding to provide centralized support to the Sheriff's
Office.
BENEFITS: The FY 2013-14 Recommended Budget for the
Benefits Unit of $797,666 includes a $217,000 GFC which replaces
funds that were formerly charged to County departments.Provide all employees with the newly developed mandatory and
elective trainings approved by the Department Heads' Training
Advisory Committee. These new mandatory trainings are to
develop and enhance skill sets that will assist in the organization's
goals to respond to its fiscal challenges, establish effective
succession planning through transformational learning and
improve horizontal and vertical communication.
Provide peer coaches as a supplement to the online new manager
training program.

The Fiscal Year (FY) 2013-14 Recommended Budget for the
Economic Development Department (EDD) is $21,144,530. FY
2013-14 anticipated revenues are $18,821,140, General Fund
Contribution of $2,230,490 and the use of Fund Balance provide a
statutorily balanced budget.
Salaries and benefits costs are $4,741,905, a decrease of $1,439,276,
an approximate 23.2% decrease. The predominant reason for this
decrease was due to funding constraints during FY 2012-13 that
resulted in a reduction of 12-staff positions in the Office of
Employment Training (OET). In addition, for FY 2013-14, 2-filled
staff positions were reduced (Management Analyst III and
Redevelopment/Housing Project Analyst III) in the Economic
Administration Unit 8221 and 2-vacant positions (Management
Analyst III and WIB Employment Programs Representative II)
were unfunded.
Services and supplies costs are $5,683,602, a reduction of
$17,946,647 compared to the FY 2012-13 Adopted Budget, an
approximately 76% reduction. The significant reduction reflects
the dissolution of redevelopment activity.
Other Charges are $3,412,031, a $2,858,890 increase over the FY
2012-13 Adopted Budget, an approximately 517% increase. The
increase in other charges is mainly attributable to three activities:
1) Construction of the on-going successor agency projects (Pajaro
park and Merritt Street) in the amount of $873,000; 2) The
inclusion of WIB Subcontracts that were not previously included in
the FY 2012-13 Adopted Budget of $820,373; and 3) The reduction
of reimbursements in the Housing and Redevelopment areas under
EDD totaling $1,150,716.
Other Financing Uses are $7,306,992, a $5,869,143 increase over
the FY 2012-13 Adopted Budget, an approximately 408% increase.
This increase is attributable to funds being transferred from the
Workforce Investment Board (WIB) to the OET. This is a change
that was a result of the OET transferring into EDD. The Workforce
Investment Board (WIB) will become the administrator of the
grant funds and will reimburse the OET via an operating transfer
out budgeted at $6,409,240. In addition, there was a reduction in
anticipated loan disbursements from the housing grants of
$401,584.
Revenue is $18,821,140 an increase of $5,455,809, or approximately
41% over the FY 2012-13 Adopted Budget . While
Intergovernmental revenue decreases by $1,586,090, an
approximately 15% decrease, Taxes increased $1,485,134 over the
FY 2012-13 Adopted Budget and Other Financing Sources grew by
$5,503,243 an approximately 41% increase. As a result of the WIB
acting as the Administrator for OET, beginning in FY 2013-14 the
grant funds historically received by OET will be recognized under
the WIB Unit 8397 with a transfer back to OET as an Operating
Transfer In. The amount budgeted from WIB to OET as an
Operating Transfer In is $6,401,973. In addition, there was a
reduction in the amount of $898,730 budgeted under Operating
Transfer In for the FY 2013-14 Recommended Budget under the
Successor Agency (Units 8422 and 8423). The FY2013-14
Recommended Budget for Successor Agency activities reflect the
latest Redevelopment Obligation Payment Schedule submitted to
the State Department of Finance.
General Fund Contributions increased by $441,404 to $2,230,490, a
25% increase, resulting in a statutorily balanced budget.
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT is represented by the Workforce
Investment Board (WIB) Fund 021-Unit 8396; Development Set
Aside Fund 001-Unit 8043; Cluster Loans Fund 001-Unit 8042;
Office of Employment Training Fund 007-Unit 8427; and the
Revolving Loan Program Fund 011-Unit 8044.
In 2011, the Economic Development Department (EDD) initiated a
strategic planning process for economic development. The plan
was based on input from more than 150 key stakeholders and the
newly created Economic Development Committee, where four
pillars of economic opportunity were identified: Agriculture,
Tourism; Research, Education and Technology; and Small Business.
Resources will be used from the budget units, other departmental
units and internal and external stakeholders to achieve specific
objectives identified in the Economic Development Work Plan.
Grants are generally budgeted after they are awarded.
HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT is represented
in Community Development Grants and Reuse Fund 13-Unit 8199
and 8200; and Inclusionary Housing Fund 009-Unit 8208.
The Community Development Grants and Reuse Fund include two
grants awarded during FY 2010-11: the Neighborhood Stabilization
Program 3 (NSP3) and from HOME Investment Partnerships
Program (HOME). During FY 2009-10, the County received NSP
funds to purchase, rehabilitate, and resell homes in areas impacted
by the housing crisis to income-qualified households. The budget
includes the use of NSP Program Income for this program, as well
as ongoing costs to implement and administer previous grants and
Program Income from Community Development Block Grants
(CDBG), HOME, and other sources.
The Inclusionary Housing Fund appropriates fund balance carried
forward from prior years. Revenues for inclusionary housing
efforts are expected to decline because of the slowdown in private
housing development in the unincorporated area, along with a
policy shift towards requiring developers to construct inclusionary
housing units on site instead of paying fees. Despite the decrease in
revenues, there is a continuing need for ongoing monitoring of
existing units, processing of owner requests to refinance or resell
their inclusionary homes, and review of new development projects
for compliance with the Inclusionary Ordinance. Annual
monitoring of HOME, Inclusionary and RDA affordable housing
units continues daily as does the assistance with the refinance and
resale of inclusionary units.
REDEVELOPMENT SUCCESSOR AGENCY AND HOUSING
SUCCESSOR AGENCY replaces the former Redevelopment
Agency (RDA), which was established by ordinance in 1972, the
Redevelopment Agency (RDA) was a planning and financing entity
formed to eliminate blight and revitalize deteriorated areas within
designated Redevelopment Project Areas. The Agency received
property tax increment in three Project Areas established under
California Redevelopment Law. February 1, 2012, due to the
Dissolution Act, the RDA was terminated.
RDA had four (4) project areas established: Castroville/Pajaro;
Boronda; Fort Ord and East Garrison. These project areas have an
obligation of Debt Service, Capital Project and Housing Fund.
With the Dissolution Act, respectively Debt Service funds became
Trust and Obligation Retirement funds; and Redevelopment
Capital Projects respectively became Redevelopment Successor
Agencies.
The Capital and Housing Set-Aside funds that were held by the
RDA are now held by the County as Successor Agency/Housing
Successor Agency of the RDA, respectively. The funds held by the
County as Successor Agency include funding to complete
enforceable obligations that were in effect at the time the RDA was
eliminated and qualify under the provisions in the law as well as a
total of $250,000 is allowed toward administrative costs. The use of
funds in these units is subject to Oversight Board approval; the
Recommended Budget reflects the funds that are expected to be
available to meet existing obligations and pass through to other
taxing entities.
The Castroville/Pajaro Redevelopment Successor Agency (formerly
the Castroville/Pajaro Redevelopment Projects) budget is
estimating receipt of grant revenues to complete the Pajaro
Neighborhood Park, which is scheduled for completion in FY
2013-14; and committed funding for pedestrian and traffic safety
improvements to Merritt Street in Castroville. Once the financial
commitments of the RDA are met, remaining funds will be
distributed to taxing entities within the project areas.
The Boronda Redevelopment Successor Agency (formerly the
Boronda Redevelopment Projects) no longer has pending project
activity.
The Fort Ord and East Garrison Successor Agencies (formerly
Housing Set-Aside Funds, respectively) have ongoing uncertainty
with respect to current and future property taxes. Revenues
received will be used to meet the Agency's obligation to provide
funds to support affordable housing opportunities located in the
East Garrison development.
The Fort Ord Redevelopment Successor Agency (formerly Ford
Ord Redevelopment Project s) and the Eas t Garrison
Redevelopment Successor Agency (formerly East Garrison
Redevelopment Projects) are committed through a Development
and Disposition Agreement (DDA) and various reimbursement
contracts with the developer of the East Garrison portion of Fort
Ord. In addition, under State law, 35% of net property taxes and
50% of lease income are payable to the Fort Ord Reuse Authority
(FORA). The budget recognizes payments to FORA and
repayment of a loan from the Housing Fund. The remaining
appropriations are to be used for the East Garrison project,
including the historic district, community facilities, and other
project implementation requirements in accordance with the DDA.
The Castroville/Pajaro Housing Successor Agency and Boronda
Successor Agency are expected to be used for continuing the
operation of the existing Kent Court affordable housing project and
approximately for monitoring other affordable housing in the
Project Areas to ensure the units remain available for low and very
low-income households.
Budget Impacts
Staff adjustments for the FY 2013-14 Adopted Budget rendered the
following filled positions eliminated: one (1) Redevelopment and
Housing Project Analyst I; and one (1) Management Analyst III;
and 2-vacant positions (Management Analyst III and WIB
Employment Programs Representative II) were unfunded.Create a workforce development strategy to connect the local labor
force and training resources to meet the needs of industries with
the best growth potential.
Develop action plans for four primary economic development
pillars: tourism, education/research technology, agriculture, and
small business.
Submit application to seek an award of $500,000 to support Veteran
employment and training efforts.
Develop a financial resources toolbox to improve access to capital
for local businesses.
Enhance coordination of economic development resources and
promote collaboration between the County, local jurisdictions, and
organizations.
Simplify and streamline regulatory processes.
Engage in a consolidated countywide marketing and branding
effort as a tool for comprehensive business attraction, local
business expansion and retention efforts.
Continue to work with Oversight Board to implement dissolution
of Redevelopment Agency as required by law and satisfy continuing
financial and project obligations.
Develop a plan for use/distribution of Housing Successor Agency
assets.
Implement efforts to secure financial resources for community and
economic development efforts to replace the loss of redevelopment
tax increment revenue.
Pending Issues
The Economic Development Department (EDD) has insufficient
Human Resources Department (HR) resources. When EDD was
separated from the Resource Management Agency (RMA) and
when the Office of Employment and Training (OET) became part
of EDD; human resource needs, such as payroll, were placed on
RMA. RMA does not have the sustained resources to meet EDD
HR requirements.
The full impact of the Federal Sequestration on limiting available
resources may become more evident over a period of time.
Recently the State conducted an audit of the OET programs that
received American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) funds
and found significant findings that may result in the County having
to reimburse the State for funds spent that did not meet the
eligibility requirements.The Recommended Budget for the Equal Opportunity Office totals
$617,362 in appropriations and General Fund Contributions (GFC)
reflecting a increase of $46,946 (8%). The department is operating
on a constrained budget and is unable to sustain the additional
departmental increases.
The Recommended Budget includes three augmentations for a
total increase of $46,846 in appropriations and GFC for
expenditures related to training, consulting services, salary and
building use allowance.
Budget Impacts
The ongoing budget constraint continues to significantly impact
the Equal Opportunity Office.
The department continues to mitigate the effects of budgetary
reductions and will continue to prioritize the workload to meet its
responsibilities.
The department continues to receive and handle a large volume of
discrimination complaints filed by county employees; this figure
has more than tripled from 2009 to present.
Similarly, there has been a significant increase in the number of
complaints from jail inmates; this figure has increased by 62% in
the first quarter of 2013 in comparison to the year-end statistics of
calendar year 2012.
The department will continue to monitor and work closely with the
Sheriff's Office to address and resolve inmate complaints.The Equal Opportunity Office will implement the Discrimination
Prevention Training Program as part of its responsibility to train all
county employees on all of the newly adopted policies: Equal
Opportunity and Non-Discrimination, Prevention of Sexual
Harassment, Diversity and the Equal Opportunity for Persons with
Disabilities and Reasonable Accommodation. The Department
will select a new vendor to provide online training on the
prevention of sexual harassment in accordance with California
state law AB1825 which is part of the Fair Employment and
Housing Act and County policy.
The Equal Opportunity Office will implement and monitor the
County's Equal Opportunity Plan. The department will partner
with the Human Resources Department to establish processes and
procedures in areas such as recruitment and retention,
classification, upward mobility, selection and other related
personnel activities that promote a diverse workforce free of
discrimination in accordance with the Equal Opportunity Plan for
County of Monterey.
The Equal Opportunity Office will develop and maintain an audit
and reporting system to measure effectiveness of equal
employment opportunity programs, including those that will
indicate the need for remedial action and determine the degree to
which goals and objectives have been obtained.
The Equal Opportunity Office will work with Department Heads
on their Department's Equal Opportunity Plan to ensure
compliance with County's Equal Opportunity Plan and assist with
their good faith efforts to achieve a diverse workforce.
The Equal Opportunity Office will work with employees to resolve
discrimination complaints at the lowest level possible to decrease
the number of formal complaints. The department will continue to
receive, address and investigate complaints of discrimination,
harassment and retaliation as mandated by State and Federal laws
and County Policy.
The Equal Opportunity Office will continue to work with the
Sheriff's Office to ensure that inmates of the Monterey County Jail
have access to a fair and accessible grievance process.
Pending Issues
There are no pending issues.
Policy Considerations
The Board of Supervisors in January 2013 approved and adopted
the County's Equal Opportunity Plan. The Equal Opportunity
Officer has the responsibility for overseeing, administering,
implementing and monitoring the Equal Opportunity Plan. The
department submitted a budget augmentation for a Senior Equal
Opportunity Analyst to work with County Departments and the
Human Resources Department in implementation of the Equal
Opportunity Plan. The department will be significantly impacted if
this budget augmentation request is not approved. Mandated
programs directed by the Board of Supervisors will be impacted.The Recommended Budget for the Auditor-Controller totals
$4,794,835 in appropriations, $401,262 in estimated revenue and a
General Fund Contribution of $4,393,573.
To achieve the County Administrative Officer's General Fund
Allocation, the Auditor-Controller's budget includes the
elimination of two Internal Auditor III positions ($235,650). A
Chief Deputy Auditor-Controller, Auditor- Controller Analyst I and
Accountant Auditor III are unfunded and require reimbursement
from an outiside source.
Due to the complexity of the County Human Resources, Payroll
and Benefits systems, reconciliation of Advantage HRM (Payroll) to
Advantage Financial (General Ledger) is very complex. In order to
reconcile the two systems, an Accountant Audit III with job
specifications requiring significant reconciliation experience has
been added, but as noted is unfunded and requires reimbursement.
Budget Impacts
Loss of the Internal Auditor positions will affect the Offices ability
to aggressively look at ways to reduce costs, and improve the
economy, efficiency, and effectiveness of operations. The positions
review, evaluate and recommend enhancements to internal
controls, department programs, franchise revenues and systems.
Further, the positions audit departmental records to assure
accurate recording of transactions, and compliance with laws,
regulations, policies, procedures and management goals. The
positions also review and analyze Procurement Card purchases and
travel reimbursements for compliance, conduct fraud
investigations regarding cash handling, and perform special studies
to analyze compliance and internal control issues.Continue improving the AP procedures by utilizing more tools

Configure new Deduction Plans for Flexible Spending.
Complete the implementation of the Advantage HRM Sick Leave
Bank module.The Treasurer-Tax Collector (TTC) department was able to
maintain a status quo GFC despite a significant increase in costs.
The department has continued to mitigate the effects of budgetary
reductions sustained in the last few years by effectively maximizing
its limited resources.
A detailed desk study for all positions was conducted to ensure that
all tasks were efficient and cost effective and to develop
performance measures that are specific to each job classification.
Additionally, several departmental performance measure oversight
committees were established to develop and analyze all employee
goals and objectives to ensure they are aligned with the
department's mission and core values.The FY 2013-14 Recommended Budget for the County Assessor
Clerk Recorder's Office includes total appropriations of $7,106,842
representing a 4.9% increase from the FY 2012-13 Adopted Budget.
Appropriations for Salaries and Benefit have increased by $105,479
(1.8%). Services and Supplies have increased by $229,401 (20.7%).
Revenues are estimated at $3,505,892, an increase of $195,989
(5.9%) from FY 2012-13.
The FY 2013-14 General Fund Contribution is $3,600,950 an
increase of $138,891 from the FY 2012-13 Adopted Budget.
Budget Impacts
The Recommended Budget provides resources to maintain FY
2013-14 service levels in the County Clerk-Recorder's Office.
Service levels in the Assessor's Office, severely impacted in prior
years, will be further reduced in FY 2013-14.
The combined efforts of the staff of the County of Monterey
Assessor's Office for FY 2012-13 produced an assessment roll of
approximately $49 billion, generating over $490 million for local
governmental agencies and schools. A total of 160,000 secured,
unsecured, and supplemental tax bills were generated in FY 2012-
13. The County's share of property tax revenues for FY 2012-2013
was $115 million accounting for 69.4% of the overall discretionary
revenue.
In FY 2012-13, the Assessor's Office had over 34,000 residential
and commercial properties with reduced values under the
provisions of Proposition (PROP) 8 due to declines in market value.
The volume of property sales and new construction is beginning to
pick up after several slow years and property reassessments and
assessment appeals are also still at higher than normal levels.
Consequently the Assessor's Office workload continues to increase
as these processes are much more labor intensive and require
greater analysis.
The remainder of the Assessor's workload and the basis for the
majority of increases of assessed valuations are the reassessment of
properties changing ownership either as a result of a sale or interfamily
transfer; the reassessment of new construction; and the
analysis of annual Business Property Statements.
From FY 1999-20 to FY 2007-08 assessed valuations in Monterey
County increased by an average of 8% per year. Property values,
however, leveled off in FY 2008-09 and in FY 2009-10 the local Tax
Roll declined for the first time in the history of the County of
Monterey. The Assessor's Office will again review the value of all
residential properties in the County of Monterey and will also
conduct an extensive review of commercial properties with current
base year values. It is estimated that over 33,000 properties will
once again receive Prop 8 reductions. Assessment Appeals are still
at a higher than normal level however the overall number of
appeals declined in 2013-2014. The Assessor's Office will review all
Prop 8 reductions on an annual basis until base year values have
been restored. The Assessor's workload has increased significantly
and yet during this time 12 out of 60 full time positions have been
deleted.

The Recommended Budget for the Office of the County Counsel is
$27,347,671, a decrease of $688,403, or 2.5%. The decrease is
primarily due to an increase in the fees charged by County Counsel
for legal services rendered. The rates were approved by the
Auditor-Controller's Office and are billed to departments or
outside agencies. By law, the fees charged cannot exceed the cost of
the services provided.
Budget Impacts
The Office of the County Counsel's FY 2013-14 Recommended
Budget includes the addition of a Management Analyst II (MA II).
The MA II position will be funded 60% by Grand Jury unit 8030
and 40% by County Counsel unit 8057 to provide administrative
support to the Civil Grand Jury (a function transferred to The
Office of the County Counsel in FY 2012-13).
Responsibility for the Lakes Fuel Spill clean-up costs (formerly
managed by the Monterey County Water Resources Agency) were
transferred to Risk Management in FY 2012-13 requiring a GFC of
$662,384.The FY 2013-14 Recommended Budget for the County Counsel
Departmental section is $2,936,379, an increase of $157,232 or
5.4%. Reflected in this budget is the addition of a Management
Analyst II position to provide administrative support for the Civil
Grand Jury and support to other County Counsel functions.The Recommended Budget provides funding to maintain FY 2012-
13 service levels. During FY 2012-13, the office had a net staffing
increase of zero positions. In December 2012, one Senior Legal
Secretar y Confidential position was reallocated to an
Administrative Secretary position, keeping in line with other
department head administrative support staff with minimal
budgetary impact.Appropriations for County Counsel are recommended by the
County Administrative Office (CAO) at $2,936,379, an increase of
$157,232 from the FY 2012-13 Adopted Budget. Estimated
revenues and Intrafund and Interfund reimbursements for FY
2013-14 are recommended at $3,558,168.
Budget Impacts
The Recommended Budget provides funding to maintain FY 2012-
13 service levels. During FY 2012-13, the Office had a net staffing
increase of zero positions. In December 2012, one Senior Legal
Secretar y Confidential position was reallocated to an
Administrative Secretary position, keeping in line with other
department head administrative support staff with minimal
budgetary impact.
In February 2013, as part of the budget process, the Auditor-
Controller's Office reviewed and approved the County Counsel's
requested rate increases of approximately 15% (by classification)
for legal services rendered to assist in the funding of additional staff
and overhead costs. All services are billed to departments or
outside agencies, and by law, cannot exceed the cost of services.
The baseline budget inter and intra-fund reimbursement and
revenue projections for FY 2013-14 were formulated with
consideration for the increase in filled attorney positions, billable
hour trends, and approved FY 2013-14 rate increases.
The Recommended Budget approves these projections, as well as
funding of salaries and benefits for all existing positions and service
and supply requests, thus reinforcing the ability of County Counsel
to meet its goal of providing timely, quality legal services to outside
agencies and departments of the County, as well as its obligation to
service BOS goals.
In FY 2012-13, the office assumed responsibility for liaison and
administrative support of the Grand Jury. Recognizing the vast
needs of the Grand Jury, as well as the need for additional support
to manage the additional project needs of its growing department,
the Office of the County Counsel requested the allocation of one
MA II position, to be funded 60% by Grand Jury fund 8030 and 40%
by County Counsel fund 8057 via an augmentation in the FY 2013-
14 Budget process.Effectively advise and represent the County's legal interests.
Provide timely, responsive, and competent legal advice to all clients
in order to enable them to effectively carry out their functions and
achieve their goals.
Defend County land use, General Plan and other actions in the
event of legal challenge and prosecute code enforcement violations.
Successfully manage and conclude tort claims and litigation in a
fair manner, which respects both the rights of claimants and
litigants and provides fiscal accountability to the public.
Resolve cases early, as appropriate, to reduce County costs.
Provide timely invoices to clients in order to maximize increased
revenue and Intrafund and Interfund reimbursements in order to
balance the Department's budget.
Maintain the professional and technical competence of all
employees through appropriate continuing education, modern
technology, and electronic case management and assignment tools,
in order to provide innovative solutions to legal problems.
Assist in re-engineering of Natividad Medical Center to a selfsustaining
entity.
Assist in the implementation of the General Plan adoption, as
directed by the Board of Supervisors.The Recommended Budget for the department totals $825,954, an
increase of $107,230 (13%) from the prior fiscal year in large part
due to a $45,427 increase in General Liability Insurance cost
allocation. The COB has minimal revenue resources and is reliant
on General Fund Contribution (GFC) for funding. Revenues are
estimated at a total $25,000, an increase of $2,500, due to an
estimated increase in the number of assessment appeals application
submittals.
The Recommended Budget includes two augmentations. The first
provides $67,866 in increased appropriations and GFC due to an
increase in General Liability Insurance (GLI) cost allocation. The
COB expects its GLI to return to its Fiscal Year (FY) 2012-13 level
in FY 2014-15. The second augmentation increases appropriations
and GFC by $36,816 to fund a Board of Supervisors Clerk position
from a 0.5 FTE to a 1.0 FTE.
Budget Impacts
The GFC allocation allows the department to meet the service
requests received by county employees, special districts,
commissions, boards, and the public and provide the highest levels
of service possible.Equipment in the Board of Supervisors Chamber will need to be
replaced soon. Given the wear and tear on the equipment (e.g.
projectors and monitors) due to consistent use, allocating funds for
the cost of repairs and replacement will reduce the impact of
unanticipated charges to the Clerk of the Board budget. The
Information Technology Department (IT) is current.Recommended appropriations are $4,889,543, an increase of
$927,088 from the Fiscal Year (FY) 2012-13 Adopted Budget, based
upon two scheduled elections occurring in November 2013 and
June 2014. This increase is due to the second scheduled election.
Election related appropriations in Services and Supplies increased
$856,290 while Salary and Benefit costs increased $70,798.
Revenues increased by $144,000 for a total of $1,255,000 in
Revenue for FY 2013-14. General Fund Contribution (GFC) is
$3,634,543, an increase of $783,088 from the previous year to fund
the June 2014 Election.
Budget Impacts
In addition to providing for the Fiscal Year (FY) 2013-14 daily
operations and services, the Recommended Budget reflects an
increase in expenditures and revenue from the FY 2012-13 budget
based on an increase in the number of scheduled elections. State
law mandates local agencies reimburse the County for election
services relating to the local November 2013 election. However,
there is no mandate for the State to reimburse counties for
conducting a State or Federal election; therefore, the funds
necessary to conduct the Statewide primary scheduled in June
2014, must be provided by the General Fund.
The Department must still comply with all mandates and
regulations surrounding election administration, even with a
reduced budget. While the FY 2013-14 budget will provide
adequate funds for the Department to conduct the statewide
primary election, any further reduction in funds will force a
reduction in temporary workers and poll workers. This reduction
will create difficulties in providing sufficient and timely customer
service both at the Department and at the polling places, election
supplies and payments to vendors, voter outreach public service
announcements, and a generally longer wait time for election night
results.Goals that relate to redesigning the bilingual services program area
and associated materials; improving the content of and access to
the Department's procedures leading to increased transparency
and public education; and obtaining an online training program for
poll workers, will remain ongoing goals for the Department, in
addition to continuing to find opportunities for efficiencies and
cost savings for the conduct of elections while still meeting legal
mandates.
Continue major efforts to increase voter outreach and education,
such as visiting schools, non-profit organizations, community
events and other facilities in Monterey County; conduct the 2nd
A.I.M. to Vote! poster contest increasing participation and voter
awareness; work with Leadership Salinas and Leadership Monterey
to utilize community partners to educate voters; schedule
television and radio interviews; and continue to find ways to
partner with service organizations to increase voter education
opportunities and participation in the Department's "Team-Up for
Democracy" program.
Complete all projects associated with the FY 2012-13 Federal
VOTE Grant program, including redesigning the Department's
website to include updated technology features and useful
information and tools for voters and poll workers. The Department
will complete a countywide assessment of all polling place facilities,
relocating from some existing facilities to locations with higher
levels of accessibility. All projects under the Grant must be
completed by June 30, 2013.
Continue to participate with the University of California at
Berkeley to study voter outreach and voting at long-term
residential facilities. Monterey County will receive up to $25,000 to
offset the cost of this project to be completed by February 2014.
Monitor State legislation that is in line with the Board of
Supervisors' Legislative Priorities such as those that permit
jurisdictions in California, including counties, to conduct all-mail
ballot elections. The Registrar of Voters attends monthly meetings
of the legislative committee for the California Association of Clerks
and Election Officials (CACEO) and can be more prepared to
communicate to the Board of Supervisors regarding the
Association's legislative concerns.
Research ways that other counties have been able to maintain a
consistent attendance and participation of a Observer Panel to
improve upon the Department's transparency and public education
activities. Since inception in 2008, membership has been sporadic
and level of participation of existing members has declined.
Continue to have the ability to send staff to continuing educational
courses through the Learning Development Network (LDN) and
through CACEO. Continuing education has proven to expand the
staff's skills and has led to the development of in-house programs
that have led to efficiencies, cost savings, and overall improvements
to the Department's operations.
Hold city clerk training sessions and candidate seminars to expand
education efforts relating to the filing processes.
Plan and hold an "Open House" for all elected officials in the
County, per the 2012 Civil Grand Jury Report.
Pending Issues
GOVERNOR'S SUSPENSION OF ELECTION MANDATES -
ONGOING: The State's FY 2011-12 Final Budget included the
suspension of six funded election program mandates including:
Absentee (Vote by Mail) Ballots, Permanent Absent (Vote by Mail)
Voters I, Absentee (Vote by Mail) Ballots: Tabulation by Precinct,
Voter Registration Procedures, Fifteen-Day Close of Voter
Registration, and the Brendon Maquire Act (special election due to
the death of a candidate). The County has not opted to cease
practicing any of the suspended mandates as costs to educate
voters and manage incoming requests for a mail ballot would
outweigh the loss in reimbursement for the activity under SB 90,
estimated at $300,000 annually. At the writing of this narrative, the
Governor is contemplating suspension of additional election and
voter related mandates, driving the County's cost for activities and
loss of funding even higher.
HELP AMERICA VOTE ACT FUNDS DEADLINE EXTENDED:
The Department is conscious of the December 31, 2015 deadline to
spend federal funding granted to Monterey County under the Help
America Vote Act (HAVA). Currently, the remaining funds are in
two categories and can be spent on voting technology and items
related to VoteCal, the State's current version of the statewide
registration database. Remaining funds are estimated at
approximately $326,196. The Department continues to study and
be aware of any new vote tabulation systems that may improve the
processing of paper ballots and nearly eliminate the need for some
temporary staff and election supplies. However, to date, there are
no newer technologies available in California for years due to
Federal and State testing requirements and costs. Both the 2007
and 2012 Civil Grand Jury Reports indicated the County's need for
new voting technologies.
DEPARTMENT FACILITY: The Elections Department's five-year
lease agreement for the current facility will end in 2015. In
coordination with Public Works and other applicable departments,the discussions of appropriate sites for the construction of a 24,000
square foot facility continue. The current building of 12,000 square
feet is leased at an annual cost of $280,000, with additional
overflow space rented at an annual cost of $12,000. Confidential
and valuable materials are moved between locations as needed
during an election cycle, reducing the Department's ability to
improve efficient operations. The lack of adequate working space
coupled with the requirement to provide publically observable and
transparent election activities puts both the staff and the security of
election results at great risk for injury or compromise. Both the
2007 and 2012 Civil Grand Jury Reports indicated the County's
need for a new facility for the Elections Department.The FY 2013-14 Recommended Budget provides $15,342,040 in
appropriations for Emergency Communications dispatch services
and NGEN Project expenditures. Financing includes $14,014,083 in
program revenue and General Fund Contributions (GFC) of
$1,327,957. The Recommended Budget represents an increase of
$121,571 in GFC from the FY 2012-13 Adopted Budget. The
increase is due to the County's share of funding for 2 additional
Communications Dispatcher 1 (CD1) positions, NGEN Operations
& Maintenance (O&M) costs, and increased benefits costs. By
implementing savings from MOU provisions as well as additional
operational savings put in place during FY 2012-13 the Department
was able to add three additional CD1 positions to this budget by
reducing the overtime appropriation.
The recommended budget includes augmentations that add 5 CD1
postions. Three are funded through a decrease to the overtime
budget and have no General Fund impact or additional cost to our
users. Two are funded through User Agency payments and GFC.
The Department is continuing to administer the NGEN capital
project. The remaining capital costs for the NGEN project are
included in this year's recommended budget. Much of the activity
for the project took place in FY 2012-13. For FY 2013-14 the
NGEN O&M budget is anticipated to be $1,024,200. This cost is
shared among all NGEN users including the participating agencies.
For County departments using the NGEN system (Sheriff,
Probation, District Attorney, Parks, Public Works, Animal Control,
Office of Emergency Services) budget their share of costs within
their respective operating budgets.The Emergency Communications Users Advisory Council
(ECUAC) has expressed concern that the County, which
contributes a minority portion of total financing for the
department, makes the budget decisions for the remaining
(majority) of users. The County Administrative Office has worked
with the ECUAC to revise the department's budget process to
address these concerns. Effective with the development of the FY
2013-14 Emergency Communications recommended budget,program and budget related decisions will be developed by the
ECUAC with representation from all members. The ECUAC will
determine the department's rcommended budget and service levels
to be taken forward for consideration by the Board of Supervisors
and to the constituents' governing bodies in the form of
recommended budgets, and provide direction to department staff
working with County service departments in reviewing charges and
levels of service provided to Emergency Communications. The
intent of this new process is to establish weighted representation
from member agencies.Cities and user agency representatives are continuing to explore the
possibility of a new governance model for Emergenc y
Communications and NGEN assets, such as forming a Joint Powers
Agreement (JPA) or modifying the existing service agreement.Review opportunities for cost savings resulting from the
installation of new 911 Telephone System. As a result of this
system, the Department anticipates improvements in productivity
and statistical reporting abilities.
Evaluate existing services to ensure services provided match the
services in the 911 Service Agreement and identify any services
that can be reduced without impact to public safety, especially
using features of the new 911 telephone system.
Continue to provide training to staff on new radio and telephone
technologies.
Maximize reimbursement from State grants and programs as well
as other opportunities such as through reimbursements for services
provided at special events.
Evaluate alternative vendors for a Telephone Emergency
Notification System to increase performance and decrease costs
relative to the current system.
Develop requirements and evaluate potential vendors for use of the
UASI grant for CAD system.
Recruit, hire and train new dispatchers. This will be our first
recruitment since 2009.The Fiscal Year (FY) 2013-14 Recommended Budget includes
appropriations of $19,289,966, and reimbursements of $18,085,806,
resulting in net appropriations of $1,204,160. Estimated revenues
are $1,204,160, providing a balanced budget without a General
Fund Contribution.
The $54,352 increase in appropriations was a net result of an
increase for salaries and benefits by $122,335 which was offset by a
total decreases of $747,926 in services and supplies. Also a
decrease in capital assets by $109,238, and reimbursements
decreased by $789,181.
The salary and benefits increase are due to staff adjustments listed
below. The Printing and Graphics Unit will cease to function under
ITD in FY 2013-14. Service and supply decrease is due to changes
in operational costs in areas, such as communication, equipment
rental and maintenance, building rental , and outside professional
services. Capital asset decreases are the result of FY 2012-13
projects being completed, some paid for by prior year cost savings.
The Information Technology Department (ITD) has successfully
transitioned to a zero General Fund Contribution department
where the department's budget is solely based on the revenue
generated through the services rendered to its clients. The FY
2013-14 Recommended Budget increased by approximately
$54,352.
ITD has completed the first phase of a reorganization. There are a
total of five position reductions for FY 2013-14.
The eliminated positions are: one (1) Graphics Art Technician, one
(1) Senior Graphics Equipment Operator, one (1) General Services
Supervisor, one (1) Warehouse Worker, and one (1) Senior
Warehouse Worker. Other positions have been shifted due to the
ITD reorganization. Printing and Graphics Unit will cease as of FY
2013-14. Two (2) of the positions transitioned within ITD.
Budget Impacts
Fiscal Year (FY) 2012-13 used labor cost savings to implement
equipment replacement of most critical or failed components in
Network, Telecom, Radio and Facilities areas.Implement Server Virtualization, reducing the 285-servers in data
center by 50% to approximately 143-servers to improve system
integration capabilities and to lower over costs of maintenance and
support. Cost savings and efficiencies will be documented and
reflected in future budgets.
Reduce telephone lease line costs by utilizing the County newly
implemented Voice over Internet Protocols (VoIP) telephone
system. Cost savings and efficiencies will be documented,
communicated and reflected in future budgets.
Collaborate with County Departments to initiate and implement
the County Website Portal project. The project purpose is to
expand access by citizens, businesses and visitors to key County
services via the Web. The goal is to improve service delivery to
County constituents; improve operational efficiency; and reduce
service delivery costs. Measurements will be developed,
documented and communicated to assess degree of success for
targeted outcomes; as well as project cost and funding alternatives.
Assist the Auditor-Controller in implementing the Enterprise
Resource Planning (ERP) System 3.9 upgrade. The ERP includes
Human Resources/Payroll, Financial, Budget Preparation and
Property Tax components, where the upgrade will improve
application performance and assure reliable access to ERP system
modules.
Initiate a project to develop a Business Continuity and Disaster
Recovery Plan to support critical County business application and
telecommunication services during and after major disasters.
Develop a plan, with a two year schedule, to phase out single use or
low use mainframe and mini-computers. The plan will include to
what degree operational costs are reduced and the reduction of
carbon footprint for information technology equipment.
Complete processes, necessary approvals and implementation
requirements to establish an ITD Internal Service Fund.
ACCOUNTING: Complete processes, necessary approvals and
implementation requirements to establish a ITD as an Internal
Service Fund beginning in FY 2014-15. This will include changes
in how the Advantage system will be utilized to enable a true profit
/ loss statement by each cost center, as well as ITD as a whole.
Restructure of ITD as a single appropriation unit offering all
services under a single billing.
RECORDS RETENTION CENTER: Increase our revenue stream
by reallocating space within the records center warehouse enabling
us to rent that space to other County Departments and Project
teams. This will not only allow the RRC to increase revenues but
will assist those departments and teams in meeting project
timelines and service delivery goals. Assist in the development of
standard Record Retention Policies and assist supported
departments in implementing those policies as they are adopted.
GIS: To finalize a GIS data sharing policy passed by the BOS which
would allow for further expansion of GIS data available to the
public and outside agencies on a fee request basis.
WEB SERVICES: To establish a County wide web strategy which
would incorporate the Web 2.0 methodology and social networking
exposure for the County.
APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT AND SUPPORT: To increase
the usage of SharePoint as an enterprise tool for both internal and
external activities. To identify and implement Business Intelligence
software systems for the growing need for results and outcome
based evaluations of social, health and justice partner programs.
SERVICE DESK: Replace the outdated Service Desk software with
current technology Service Desk software that integrates with
service billing and timekeeping.
Anticipate 2692 Incidents and 5370 new enhancement work
requests in order to keep desktop and client applications connected
and functional.
Implementation of a virtualized server environment is planned
with the goal of being able to provide quicker and less expensive
server hosting solutions to County departments. In conjunction
with DSS, a virtualized desktop environment will be implemented
to accommodate their new call center that will be staffed by County
personnel.
NETWORK: Complete architectural engineering study of the
County network to develop a replacement plan for the existing 12
year old infrastructure.
TELECOM: Engage with telecom consultant to assist with
independent review and examination of records and activities to
assess the compliance of telecom service providers with
telecommunication contracts and State and Federal Tariffs. This
project will initiated as joint effort with the CAO's office and will
require participation from and all County Departments to ensure
that telecom charges are accurate and reflect the services that are
required to support operations.
Pending Issues
A request has been filed with the Federal Communications
Commission (FCC) to extend the mandated completion date of
January 2013 to June 2013 for the Monterey County Operational
Area Emergency Communications System (NGEN).

The Recommended Budget for the office totals $20,759,641,
financed by $11,682,583 in program revenue and $9,077,058 in
General Fund Contributions (GFC).
The Recommended Budget includes augmentations of 11.0
positions, including: 1.0 Real Estate Fraud Investigator, 1.0 Real
Estate Fraud Forensic Accountant, 1.0 Assistant District Attorney
for the Monterey Office; 4.0 Legal Secretaries; 1.0 Victim
Assistance Advocate, 1.0 Computer Forensic Analyst, 1.0
Investigative Aide, and 1.0 Gang Unit Investigator. Much of the
funding for the recommended 11 new positions is supported by
new or existing program revenues, with a total recommended GFC
commitment of $403,521.
Budget Impacts
The Department has restored some of the positions lost during the
past several years due to the recession, thereby improving the
services we are able to provide to our citizens. New grants have
been obtained over the past several years and we anticipate them
growing during the upcoming year, providing even more services to
our community. We continue to seek additional funding from both
federal and State sources as they become available.Collaborate with other state and local agencies to devise new
approaches to disrupting gang violence. The damage that gang
violence inf licts on the County's residents requires law
enforcement to keep searching for a coordinated approach to this
most pressing problem in our community.
Increase in-house training. To the extent in-house training can
meet both mandatory and necessary training of attorneys,
investigators and support staff, it will be a far less expensive
alternative.
Implementation of the new Case Management System will present
both unique challenges to our staff, as well as the opportunity to
revise the way we do business. This new system will increase
productivity for our staff and ultimately enhance public safety.
Pending Issues
CJIS/SUSTAIN: The criminal justice agencies continue to explore
all options that will allow an electronic interface to share
information for a more efficient and cost effective operation.
County justice agencies continue to maintain the current Criminal
Justice Information System (CJIS) on the County's mainframe. The
current system is obsolete and is no longer adequate. It must be
replaced. The District Attorney is currently under contract to have
a new case management system installed and anticipate going
operational in the summer of 2013.
RELOCATION: We continue to be housed in modular units in
both Salinas & Marina, and in office facilities at the Monterey
Courthouse. The court has recently delayed the process of
constructing new South County facilities. When completed, the
county will need to meet this challenge by providing offices for
District Attorney use as close to the new courthouse as possible.
The issue of appropriate office space for the District Attorney's
Office continues to remain one of our most pressing issues.
PAST SERVICE LEVEL REDUCTIONS - IMPACT ON PUBLIC
SAFETY: The complexity and severity of budget issues throughout
the State remain a significant risk to the funding of District
Attorney programs and raise a cloud of uncertainty around the
potential negative impact on our community. This hopefully is not
a long term issue, for as the economy improves service levels
should be restored. As an example, when we have been at full
strength, four investigative aides served over 22,000 subpoenas on
witnesses. Due to County budget constraints, we have had to
eliminate 25 percent of that section. The increased case load for
the remaining investigative aides will tax them and some
defendants will not be held accountable because we are not able to
obtain all witnesses necessary for court.
REALIGNMENT: The implementation of AB109 in October 2011,
shifting state prisoners to local authorities, has led to a profound
change in how the criminal justice system and the public safety
agencies protect the community. The elimination of parole and the
return of State prison inmates to local authorities for management
will be challenging for the entire County. The long-term impact on
the District Attorney's Office remains uncertain. The unknowns for
realignment are significant, making it difficult to plan for the
future.The Department of Child Support Services recommended budget
includes appropriations of $10,694,050, a decrease of $20,506 from
the FY 2012-13 Adopted Budget. As required by legislation,
effective January 1, 2000, this budget has been submitted to the
State for approval. The negative General Fund Contribution
reflected in the Fiscal Summary above is for administrative support
activities charged to the program through the Countywide Cost
Allocation Plan (COWCAP) and the non recoverable portion of the
'Pajaro' judgment.
Budget Impacts
The State Department of Child Support Services continues to hold
the allocation of funds at a basic level as what was received 11 years
ago. This flat allocation of funding has resulted in loss of staffing
over the years, reducing staffing by 59 allocated positions from FY
2002-03. Without additional funding to cover cost increases, the
department will continue to see erosion of staffing. The
department will continue to review cost savings and sharing of
services with other county local child support agencies. This will
allow us to maintain our basic core Federal and State mandated
services.
Providing Child Support Services avoids costs to other agencies
and to taxpayers. We continue to offset costs to the County General
Fund by the recovery of the County share related to those receiving
TANF cash grant funds. The department, with a caseload of 18,164
children, distributed over $38,138,263 in 2012, which represents
needed money that helps families reach and maintain selfsufficiency.Continue to deliver our core services and at the same time improve
in all Federal/State performance measures.
Continue to provide a quality service to our customers and be a
leader in the use of best practices and innovation, so that families
and children are receiving the optimal amount of child support and
health insurance coverage.
Continue to have a proactive outreach program with emphasis on
collaboration and sharing of services so that we optimize our
mandated services in the most efficient manner and continue to be
a leader within the State of California Child Support Program.
Leverage technology to increase effectiveness and efficiency.
Lower energy costs by our continued education of staff regarding
the importance of conserving energy and reengineering and
implementing the latest technological advancement of our
building's heating and ventilation system.
Develop and retain employees by providing ongoing professional
development courses including utilizing the County's "Learning
Development Network".The Fiscal Year (FY) 2013-14 Recommended Budget is $9,568,943
and includes $402,256 in revenues and $9,166,687 in General Fund
Contributions (GFC). AB 109-Public Safety Realignment funding of
$91,128 is recognized in both General Fund 001 and Special
Revenue Fund 022-Local Revenue Fund 2011 for accounting
purposes. The Department received $77,887 AB 109 funding for
FY 2012-13.
The recommended budget restores four filled positions including
two attorneys, one investigator, and one clerical.
Budget Impacts
The Recommended Budget does not allocate funds for potential
employee leave accrual payments. In addition, case and trial
related expenses, and timely replacement of computers and office
furniture are not sufficiently funded.Implementation of Criminal Justice Realignment will challenge all
components of the indigent defense agencies.
The Public Defender's Office continues to occupy modular building
#4 several years longer than expected. This structure has been in
need of many critical space improvements.
The need for a permanent solution for the Chief ADO function
remains. The replacement of the deleted ADO Chief position with
a contract Interim Chief is now in its fourth year. It is also
necessary to provide appropriate support services including office
space to accommodate the ADO staff and to maintain the legal and
ethical separation required between the PDO and ADO.
Policy Considerations
The Recommended Budget is unable to address the Department's
continuing staffing shortage that is hindering the indigent defense
function in Monterey County. Caseloads at any one time regularly
exceed the limits set by applicable professional standards for an
entire year. The number of cases that have gone to hearing and or
trial has grown and there has been increases in the severity of
cases.The FY 2013-14 Recommended Budget for the Sheriff 's Office
includes $85,871,461 in total appropriations, estimated revenue of
$38,521,394, and General Fund Contributions (GFC) of
$47,350,067. Much of the increase in appropriations and revenues
in FY 2013-14 is related to the State's realignment of public safety
responsibilites to the County. For transparency in reporting, the
County established Fund 022, in which all realignment revenues are
deposited. Operating transfers occur between the General Fund
and Fund 022 for realigned programs' payments.
Significant changes for FY 2013-14 include an Operating Transfer
In of $3.0 million in public health realignment monies for Inmate
Medical Services to help offset the increasing costs of health care
services for the changing inmate population. Additionally, the
Recommended Budget includes $2.2 milion in augmentations
meant primarily to improve the safety and security of staff, the
community, and inmates housed in the County Jail. To accomplish
this, the Recommended Budget includes augmentations for inmate
medical services, funding to cover building use charges, reestablishing
the Corrections Emergency Response Team (CERT)
team and associated training and equipment, and technology
upgrades and improvements including video surveillance in the jail.
The augmentations also allow the Sheriff 's Office to fund 14
additional positions including 12 additional Custody and Control
positions for the Control Towers in the jail, which will help address
staffing shortages and allow the department to redeploy deputies to
critical functions requiring their level of skill and training. The
recommended budget also includes augmentations for two
Management Analyst III positions to oversee the development,
improvement, and implementation of various inmate programs in
the jail aimed at helping inmates become successful members of
society and reducing recidivism. These two management analyst
positions will also provide a type of ombudsman role to facilitate
communication between inmates, health and program providers,
and corrections staff to ensure adequate and safe provision of
services.
The Recommended Budget includes a total of 440.5 positions,
representing a net increase of 17 positions over the FY 2012-13
Adopted Budgeted. Of the 17 additional positions, four were added
in FY 2012-13 through the Board Report process. Of those four
positions, two Deputy positions were added due to restored grant
programs and two positions were added to support realignment
responsibilities. In addition, one Personnel Technician position was
transferred to the Human Resources Department as part of the
Board of Supervisors' plan to recentralize the County's Human
Resources functions.
Budget Impacts
Although the FY 2013-14 Recommended Budget does not include
cuts in General Fund Contributions, increases in costs such as
General Liability, employee benefits, and facility maintenance
continue to put budgetary pressure on the Sheriff 's Office and
restrict the department's flexibility in assigning resources to rapidly
changing service requirements.
The impacts of the recent enactment of State Realignment through
AB 109 continue to be assessed and may require significant
changes to operations and management of the County Jail as more
inmates with longer sentences are sentenced to local confinement.
In addition, the recent loss of Federal funding for the Gang Task
Force has resulted in a new joint effort with the City of Salinas and
other agencies. Funding for this new effort and the roles and
responsibilities of each of the partners is still being defined as the
participation of federal and state agencies remains uncertain.
The evolving nature of these and other programs requires the
Sheriff 's Office to have the flexibility to allocate resources to
effectively manage and support these programs. Unfortunately, the
Recommended Budget does not address the increasing costs and,
thus, limits any such flexibility.
The budget does begin to acknowledge and address some of the
equipment, facility and staffing needs that are critical to the
continued provision of public safety services. However, additional
action will be needed in FY 2013-14 to adequately budget for the
necessary facility repairs and improvements in order to support the
department's ability to provide adequate services.ADMINISTRATION BUREAU GOALS FOR FY 2013-14
INCLUDE: finalizing the implementation of the new Records/Jail
Management system and timekeeping/scheduling system; propose
a reorganization to provide the most efficient and cost effective
organizational structure of the management and administrative
staff, based on the results of an audit of the Civil Division and the
analysis of various classifications within the organization; and
utilize the new CSI staff to process crime scenes, freeing up Crime
Lab staff to eliminate the current backlog of fingerprints awaiting
processing.
ENFORCEMENT OPERATIONS BUREAU GOALS FOR FY 2013-
14 INCLUDE: create a more tactical approach to reducing gang
violence and drug trafficking through the LEOC and fully equip
and utilize the new Crime Scene Investigations deputies to assist
with processing crime scenes throughout the County.
CUSTODY OPERATIONS BUREAU GOALS FOR FY 2013-14
INCLUDE: ensure that the number and types of inmates in the
County Jail as a result of AB 109 is effectively managed for both
inmate and employee safety, which may include contracting with
other facilities to house some of our inmates; finalize the
Environmental Impact Review for the AB 900 jail expansion
project; apply for $80 million in funds through the SB 1022 Grant
process and begin the planning and construction of a new facility
adjacent to the AB 900 County Jail Expansion site.
Pending Issues
The Enforcement Operations Bureau has recently made great effort
to recruit and train additional deputies. However, the current
available funding is sufficient only to provide slightly above the
minimal level of service to the unincorporated area. This situation
threatens the public welfare, as well as officer safety due to the large
areas covered by each deputy, which lengthens response times and
limits the timeliness of backup. In addition, there are insufficient
deputies to provide the type of concentrated enforcement activities
to respond to crime trends within the community.
Although the Monterey County Jail is already operating
significantly over capacity, two issues are creating additional
pressures on this facility. Both the Federal Court ruling and State
Realignment legislation have resulted in increased numbers of
inmates to be housed in the Jail. Given the current overcrowded
condition, any increase in inmates requires the release of other
inmates until the construction of new facilities can occur. The
County has begun to address these issues through award of the AB
900 funds, application to the SB 1022 program, and the contract
with Alameda County.
Custody Operations had a fleet of three buses used to transport
inmates to court and to other penal institutions. The oldest bus
was built in 1984, and the others in 1988 and 1991. In FY 2012-13,
one of those buses was replaced with a new bus with funds from
the Vehicle Replacement Fund. Because the buses are law
enforcement equipped and operated, they are exempt from diesel
particulate emissions standards. However, in 2014, State emission
reduction goals require 100% compliance and may apply to the
inmate transportation buses. If this happens, the two remaining
old buses will need to be replaced and/or taken off the road.The Recommended Budget for the Department totals $52,988,806
and is financed by $36,268,280 in program revenue and
$16,720,526 in General Fund Contributions (GFC). Most of the
increase in revenues and appropriations over the prior year are
related to the State's Public Safety Realignment (AB 109), which
realigned responsibility for supervising lower level adult offenders
from the State to local jurisdictions. The realigned responsibilities
result in increased revenues and expenditures for the department.
Other significant changes include: higher Proposition 172 (public
safety sales tax) revenues, transfer of $80,000 in funding from the
County Administrative Office to the Probation Department for the
Adult Placement Program, and $489,618 in budget augmentations.
The recommended augmentations reflect an increase of $286,816
for building use charges, $63,000 for NGEN support and
maintenance and $139,802 for Microsoft software system upgrades.
The Recommended Budget also includes a total of 298.0 positions,
representing a net increase of eight positions over the FY 2012-13
Adopted Budget. A total of seven positions were added in the FY
2012-13 budget year to directly support the State's Public Safety
Realignment (AB 109). Also, one position was added to support
the Adult Placement Program. These position increases resulted in
a net increase of eight positions from the FY 2012-13 Adopted
Budget.
Final note, the recommended budget of $52,988,806 consists of two
funds; Local Realignment Fund 022 budget of $14,320,218 and
General Fund 001 budget of $38,668,588. The Fund 022
recommended budget is a pass through fund for receipt of state
realignment funds and Probation is reimbursed from Fund 022 for
state program costs incurred during the year.
Budget Impacts
The Department experienced a decrease in program funding due to
several grant expirations and elimination or reduction of State
funding. Expiration of the Probation Special Supervision Program,
Adult Drug Court, and the Juvenile Offender Community Health
Service Program resulted in a funding decrease of $231,526.
Further, the State eliminated its portion of the School Nutrition
Program, resulting in a loss of $22,800. The State also reduced
funding for the SB 678 program by 74.5%, amounting to a local
funding decrease of $205,000. Total funding loss from the
aforementioned programs is $459,326.The Department experienced various expenditure increases, as
well as new costs compared to the prior year's adopted budget.
Cost increases included: $347,256 for salaries and benefits due to
step advancement and health care cost, $59,453 for insurance costs,
and $78,464 for information technology and software support.
Probation responded to these funding decreases and cost increases
by prudently managing staffing and overtime, negotiating better
prices with vendors, and streamlining processes to reduce program
expenses. These efforts partially mitigated the funding losses and
cost increases, but a structural gap in funding remains. The
Department also submitted budget augmentation requests
(included in the recommended budget) totaling $489,618 for
funding building use charges, Next Generation radio support, and
the critical software update.
Also included in the recommended level of funding is an increase
in various expenditures related to staffing and benefits that have
been historically higher than the FY 2012-13 approved budget
(such as payments for workers compensation, unemployment,
evening and night differentials, bilingual and educational stipends,
and on-call staff supporting the Juvenile Hall and Youth Center).
Due to the implementation of Proposition 21, juveniles facing adult
court proceedings continue to generate additional costs associated
with extended detention in Juvenile Hall. Depending on the
number of arrests and the court processes, the Department's
budget will have less capacity to absorb these increased costs in FY
2013-14.
Reductions in funding at the State and local level could impact
Probation's ability to fulfill its mandates and provide missioncritical
services to the community. The recommended budget and
its allocated positions constitute a thoughtful and conservative use
of available resources to fulfill mandated responsibilities and
sustain current operations in a scaled-back manner. Due to the
economic downturn, the flexibility of the Department to fulfill its
obligations is challenged. The Department is committed to do
everything possible to contribute to public safety and protection of
the community in spite of the fiscal challenges that have
accumulated in recent years. Lower levels of resources included in
the recommended budget may be barely sufficient to maintain the
necessary level of services, particularly in consideration of the
increase in its span of control for adult and juvenile offenders. The
Department will carefully and responsibly monitor expenses, and,
if necessary, request additional appropriations.The Probation Department is dedicated to achieving and
maintaining the following goals:
To improve the quality of life for youth, seniors and families by
preventing and reducing the frequency, severity, and impact of
criminal and delinquent behavior among adults and juveniles who
come within the jurisdiction of the Probation Department
(ongoing).
To enhance public safety programs throughout Monterey County
by collaboration and cooperation with other departments and
agencies and by the development of new and innovative methods to
address the issues of public safety (ongoing).
To expand services to the young adult population and address
specific needs, e.g., mental health, substance abuse and vocational
training (ongoing).
To create more manageable caseloads for officers, particularly in
the Domestic Violence Unit.
To continue to enhance the collection of probation fees in
collaboration with the Treasurer's Revenue Division.
To continue to participate in the process toward a new, more
functional juvenile detention facility.
To continue to serve as the lead agency to maintain core functions
and expand the Silver Star Resource Center, as a "one stop"
program for gang prevention and intervention (ongoing).
To continue to serve as the lead agency for the Juvenile Justice
Crime Prevention Act (JJCPA) Programs (ongoing).
To serve as the lead agency for the Community Correction
Partnership, and for the implementation of the Community
Correction Program, as mandated by PC 1230 (SB 678) to reduce
the number of felony probationers sent to prison through the
implementation of evidence-based probation supervision strategies
and programs (on-going).
Continue to enhance data collection capabilities in the Case
Management System (CMS) to track, monitor and report data on
its juvenile and adult populations, and to analyze and evaluate the
success of programs and program participation, and develop new
data requirements for realigned adult and juvenile populations.The State's realignment of public safety responsibilities to counties,
effective October 1, 2011, continues to impart major operational
changes in the Adult Division's operations. The realignment
significantly increases Probation's span of control on "non-nonnon"
(non-serious, non-violent, non-sex offenses, and without any
prior conviction) adult offenders, as well as offenders released to
local authority under Post Release Community Supervision (PRCS)
status.
The Governor's FY 2013-14 Proposed Budget would reduce SB 678
funding to Monterey County by $205,000. This program was
designed to reduce the number of felony probationers sent to
prison through the implementation of evidence-based probation
supervision strategies and programs. There is a legislative proposal
to reinstate a portion of this funding based on a modified service
level formula. Funding is pending the Governor's May Revision.
The operational and financial impact of the state-mandated Static-
99R assessment for adult sex offenders continues to be assessed.
Further, the cost of Global Positioning System monitoring for highrisk
sex offenders while on probation continues to be absorbed by
the Department.
The Juvenile Accountability Block Grant (JABG) continues to be
reduced each year, while requiring additional data. This appears to
be a trend in data requirements from both the State and federal
entities.
The Department is incurring additional costs for mandated core
training required by Title 15 for part-time and temporary Juvenile
Institutions Officers. Increasing mandated Standards and Training
for Corrections (STC) costs challenge the Department's ability to
cover all training expenses.The Recommended Budget for the department totals $9,452,256 in
appropriations, financed by $6,487,571 in program revenue and
$2,964,685 in General Fund Contribution (GFC).
Budget Impacts
Decreased resources for agricultural programs will impact the
department's service delivery; however, the department will
redirect, through reprioritization, existing resources to increase
efficiencies and minimize these impacts.Promote and protect agriculture, the environment, and public
welfare, and assure consumer and business confidence in the
marketplace through uniform enforcement of laws and regulations.
Pending Issues
The expected reductions in Federal funding may present budgetary
challenges in FY 2013-14. The department continues to support
State and Federal activities, especially as related to facilitation of
commerce. The Department currently issues approximately 7,000
Phytosantary Certificates annually for shipments related to Light
Brown Apple Moth (LBAM) quarantines.
The department will work with the California Department of Food
& Agriculture (CDFA) to continue detection efforts for the
European Grape Vine Moth and a citrus pest, the Asian Citrus
Psyllid. Quarantines for the LBAM are impacting trade with
Canada and Mexico and will require dedication of resources to
maintain these markets. The status of funding to cover the costs
associated with these programs is uncertain. Reduction in funding
levels could significantly impact these efforts and may require local
resources to protect the County's agricultural from these and other
pests.
There is a continuing focus on local use of fumigants, and
significant new use requirements. This will result in a continuing
dedication of staff resources to fumigation issues.
Implementation of the new General Plan will require a dedication
of staff resources. The department will also be taking on an
expanded role in the administration of the County's Agricultural
Preserve (Williamson Act) program.

Implement phytosanitary certification activities facilitating trade
with other states and countries especially related to Light Brown
Apple Moth.
Monitor issues related to food safety and water quality and
collaborate with stakeholders, other departments and agencies as
appropriate.
Emphasis on training and retention efforts for all positions to
maintain core services levels and succession planning.
Direct pesticide resources on fumigants, and related issues.
Respond to emerging and ongoing pest exclusion and quarantine
activities, particularly those related to the Light Brown Apple Moth
, Glassy-Winged Sharp Shooter, European Grapevine Moth , Asian
Citrus Psyllid and preventing introduction of other exotic insects,
pests and diseases. Work with Parks Department and Water
Resources Agency on the detection and exclusion of the Quagga
Mussel from the waters of the County.
As resources allow, continue collaboration with other departments
and agencies on education and outreach related to resource
conservation issues (such as erosion) and water quality in concert
with our pesticide use enforcement efforts.
Direct limited, available resources through the Monterey County
Weed Management Area to work cooperatively on the control of
noxious weeds in the County and coordinate efforts of, and obtain
funding for, weed management efforts. Collaborate specifically
with Parks and Water Resources on weeds and other pests of
mutual interest, as resources allow.
Increase protection of the County's residents, businesses and
visitors through fair and equitable enforcement of weights and
measures laws, and the adoption of a price verification scanner
ordinance.
Support of the Board's Agricultural Advisory Committee; and,
collaborate with the Resource Management Agency on land use
issues.
Suport the implementation of the County's General Plan on
matters pertaining to agriculture.
Develop uniform guidelines for the County's Williamson Act
program, including revisions to the compatible uses allowed in
agricultural preserves.

The FY 2013-14 Recommended Budget for the Resource
Management Agency totals $74,742,156 in appropriations financed
by $41,236,933 in program revenue, $13,053,411 in General Fund
Contribution (GFC) and $20,451,812 in other fund balances.
The preliminary GFC targets provided by the CAO remained flat
from the prior FY 2012-13, while costs increased in a number of
areas, including: employee annual step increases, flexible benefit
costs, general liability insurance, property insurance, County
Counsel rates, and beginning with FY 2013-14, the Building Use
Allowance charge of $248,789 for the combined General Fund units
in RMA.
During FY 2012-13 there continued to be significant changes in the
leadership of the RMA with the hiring of a new Public Works
Director. The RMA leadership team continues to review the RMA
organization and make changes to enhance efficiencies in
operations and improve customer service. Some of these changes
have been included in the FY 2013-14 Recommended Budget
through the addition of a dedicated position to process the
Departments' payroll, as well as the payroll for the Economic
Development Department.
Additional information about significant areas of budgetary change
from FY 2012-13 to FY 2013-14 is provided within division level
narratives.
Budget Impacts
The Budget impacts related to the improvements to the San Jerardo
Water System are currently being determined as the Federal, State,
and local grants are being closed out. Projected negative fund
balance in the Boronda County Sanitation District (BCSD) are
currently being analyzed and a solution will be developed by the
end of the fiscal year.
Analysis is currently underway for the projected negative fund
balances for the Chualar County Services Area 75 (CSA 75). Grant
funding and rate adjustments will need to be considered to achieve
a positive fund balance and adequate funds for operation,
maintenance, and capital improvements.
RMA-PW developed a County program in response to the Central
Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board September 2012
adoption of Stormwater Treatment requirements for new
development and redevelopment projects with greater than 2,500
square feet of impervious surface. A portion of the program was
audited by the Water Board staff in March 2013. Staff indicated
that a Notice of Violation will be considered by the Water Board in
July 2013. There may be a negative financial impact to the County
should the Water Board assess a fine.
Prior Year Accomplishments
Prior year accomplishments are presented at the division level.
Budget Year Goals
Budget year goals are presented at the division level.
Pending Issues
Currently, the Road Fund, Fund 002, includes maintenance, capital,
and general operations. This mixed use makes it difficult to
identify how much funding is being dedicated to addressing the
growing backlog of transportation maintenance activities
including, but not limited to: pavement rehabilitation, striping,
signs, pavement markings, bridges, culverts, guardrails, etc. RMA
recommends that the Road Fund be restructured into separate
account structures and funds during FY 2013-14 to more clearly
define expenditures and funds associated with performing road
maintenance, capital road projects, and reimbursable work. The
revised structure will provide clear delineation of expenditures per
project type in the FY 2014-15 Recommended Budget.
RMA staffing includes a single Real Property Specialist managing
all of the County's real property activities. This level of staffing is
insufficient to address the ongoing facility and space needs of
County departments, services and functions. Funding budgeted in
FY 2012-13 for temporary assistance is included again in FY 2013-
14 to maintain the current level of temporary support. Efforts in
FY2013-14 will focus on identifying the ongoing resource needs to
more appropriately manage these functions and provide services at
a more adequate level.
The full impact on the County and the RMA from the elimination
of the Redevelopment Agency remains unclear. Over the course of
FY 2012-13 the RMA was requested to take the lead in the
management oversight of on-going Successor Agency projects:
Pajaro Park, Merritt Street, and East Garrison. While the Analyst
that is managing these projects is currently located within the
RMA, the position and accounting structure still falls under the
responsibility of the Economic Development Department.
Additional discussion is necessary to determine the most
appropriate placement of this position, as well as the additional
resources required to assist in managing of the East Garrison
Development.
Following separation of the Redevelopment/ Housing Office from
RMA, the RMA had continued to assist the new department with
processing workers' compensation, personnel transactions, and
payroll. During FY 2012-13, RMA was asked to increase the level
of Administrative support to the Economic Development
Department (EDD) to include: accounting, finance, contracts
management, safety, payroll and IT. Following Board approval to
transfer the Office of Employment Training (OET) into EDD, an
assumption was made that RMA would acquire the additional
workload for processing OET timecards (34). The Department of
Social and Employment Services has indicated that, effective July 1,
2013, they will no longer provide Human Resource support to the
OET, now part of the EDD. This creates concerns, as neither RMA
nor the EDD have the appropriate level of resources to support the
increased workload for administering 34 additional personnel.
Since the Board actions moved this function to the EDD, it will be
necessary for HR to review redistribution of related Human
Resources support to ensure the shift of workload to the EDD
receives offsetting resources.
As requirements and regulations continue to increase with regards
to the County's Stormwater Program, RMA will be evaluating the
need to create a separate accounting and operating structure that
captures the full countywide cost of this program, for inclusion in
the FY 2014-15 Budget.
More than $4 million in energy efficiency measures was identified
during the energy audits performed as part of Department of
Energy's Energy and Efficiencies Community Block Grant; however
the grant only provided funding to address $1 million of needs.
RMA will be looking to identify potential funding to pursue the
additional energy efficiency opportunities.
Completion of tasks related to 2010 General Plan implementation,
update of the Local Coastal Program, implementation of AB 32
(Global Warming Solutions Act), and Fort Ord Reassessment will
require additional review and Board considerations regarding the
pace of program adoption.
The Recommended FY 2013-14 RMA Administration (Unit 8222)
Budget includes $3,760,965 in Salaries and Benefits and $666,130 in
Services and Supplies. Most of the Budget expenditures will be
charged back to the various agency Budgets by Intra/Inter Fund
Transfers ($3,887,926) for services provided. This will leave a
General Fund Contribution of $562,221. Consolidation of effort,
centralized focus, and improved coordination by the Agency units
and the centralization of the administrative and financial support
will increase the efficiency and effectiveness of providing services.
The significant changes between FY 2012-13 and FY 2013-14
include an overall increase in Salaries and Benefits and Services
and Supplies. The increase in Salaries and Benefits is partially due
to the addition of a Principal Office Assistant position, responsible
for the processing of payroll for the RMA Department as well as the
Economic Development Department (EDD). Previously, the
Department has had to rely on temporary support to carry out this
critical function. A factor in the increase in services and supplies is
the reimbursement of EDD staff supporting RMA initiatives such
as the San Lucas Water grant applications, Successor Agency, and
former RDA projects. INTERAGENCY PROJECTS: Interagency coordination and
implementation of the Storm Water Management program
including options for funding. Successful completion of special
handling projects including difficult development applications,
complex property negotiations, and significant capital issues,
including: General Plan Implementation; assist with processing
significant project applications (Ferrini Ranch, Paraiso Springs,
Rancho Canada Village, Fort Ord Reassessment, Carmel Lagoon);
participation in the Association of Monterey Bay Area
Governments (AMBAG) interagency process including the Energy
program; coordinated effort for a Downtown Government Center
with the City of Salinas; participate with implementation of
economic development initiatives; continued coordination of staff
support for Board appointed committees; collaboration with
jurisdictions to implement renewable energy initiatives/projects
(e.g., solar, small wind energy).
RMA INTERDEPARTMENTAL FISCAL INITIATIVES: Continue
to improve interagency coordination regarding estimating,
budgeting and collecting fees for services such as Development
Applications, Appeals, Fleet, Community Services Areas/ Districts,
Capital projects, etc. Coordinate traffic impacts fees with TAMC
and the regional fee update. Examine opportunities for collection
of fees for unfunded mandates and General Plan policies
(development impacts, Capital Improvement and Financing Plan,
etc). Enhance agency efforts to identify, seek and obtain public and
private grants . Continue work funded under a Coastal
Implementation Assistance Program (CIAP) grant.

organizational changes and needs. Develop the bilingual
certification RMA guidelines. Continue to gather data and make
recommendations for improvement as turnover trends and
systemic problems are identified.
EMPLOYEE RELATIONS: Continue to provide assistance to
supervisors and managers in performance management issues and
the completion of performance appraisals. Develop and provide
training on performance documentation, writing Performance
Improvement Plans and writing disciplinary notices. Establish
policies and best practices to achieve consistency and conformance
across all RMA units. Increase efforts to educate employees about
the resources available to them for career advancement
opportunities within the RMA and other Departments in the
County.

standard of efficiency and accuracy with regards to payroll and
personnel transaction processing all of RMA and EDD. Continue to
develop and deliver training for new and existing employees for the
Advantage Employee Self Service system. Update and educate
employees on County benefits through communications such as
email, staff meetings and the RMA Newsletter. Further develop
time management procedures that conform to the automated
system. Develop and deliver additional training to review timecard
completion and requirements for employees, supervisors and
managers.
EMPLOYEE HEALTH AND SAFETY: Ensure development,
implementation and updates of safety and health programs and
plans. These may include: Hazard Communication Program,
Personal Protective Equipment Program (PPE) and Job Hazard
Analysis Plans. Conduct periodic safety and health walk-through
inspections of workplace facilities. Conduct accident and injury
investigations and identify root causes and recommend corrective
actions. Respond to employee inquiries, suggestions and
complaints. Continue to facilitate and provide relevant safety
training for all RMA employees.
CONTRACTS ADMINISTRATION: Efficiently alter existing
RMA Contracts Administration Database to effectively monitor all
of the RMA Professional Services Agreements (PSA) and other
Agreements, including the expiration date and approved not to
exceed amount. Continue to support and coordinate with RMA
Project Managers and RMA Finance Staff to appropriately monitor

PSA and other Agreement terms and funding. Update and educate
RMA Staff on the process of initiating or amending an Agreement
through communications such as email, staff meetings and the
RMA Newsletter. Continue staff cross-training and expand
knowledge by attending technical contract classes.
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY: The RMA administration and
finance projected IT goals for FY 2013-14 include the completion
of the Wincams and Advantage payroll interface; increased
utilization of the Wincams application for Facilities Management;
upgrade traffic counter hardware and software; implementation of
the interface between the permitting system, Accela, and the
County's electronic document management system (EDMS);
upgrade the permit counter ticketing system (Qmatic). Continue
the PC and Microsoft Office upgrade for the remaining one-third
of RMA computers, as part of a 3-year PC replacement cycle plan.

timely payment of vendor invoices a priority; increase staff skills
and knowledge by encouraging participation in classes provided by
the County; collaboratively work with the Auditor-Controller on
the Advantage Accounts Receivable module to track other agency
reimbursements.
Provide administrative support to the Economic Development
Department to include: accounting, finance, contracts
management , payroll, personnel transactions, workers
compensation, safety, and IT.The Fiscal Year (FY) 2013-14 Recommended Budget includes
appropriations of $159,079,766, an increase of $22,247,631 from
the FY 2012-13 Adopted Budget. The Recommended Budget is
financed by $153,655,343 in revenues, $5,024,599 in prior year fund
balance, and $3,749,824 in General Fund Contribution (GFC). The
FY 2013-14 Recommended Budget includes 41 additional Clinic
Services positions at no additional GFC in preparation for
implementing the Affordable Care Act.
The Requested Budget also includes $750,000 from Natividad
Medical Center for the cost of the Residency program operated in
the Laurel Clinics.
Budget Impacts
ANIMAL SERVICES: The General Fund Contribution (GFC) for
Animal Services is $1,392,180, an increase of $107,773 from the FY
2012-13 Adopted Budget GFC of $1,284,407. Revenues for Animal
Services have continued to decline requiring additional GFC. While
there were program savings in FY 2012-13 as a result of the recently
vacated 0.75 FTE veterinarian position (replaced by a contract
veterinarian), and the reallocation of 1.0 FTE position from a
Principal Office Assistant to an Office Assistant I, realized savings
were insufficient to cover decrease in revenue. Staff will continue to
identify opportunities for reducing operating expenditures and
increasing revenue in FY 2013-14.
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH: The Affordable Care Act (ACA) Medi-
Cal expansion and Federal reimbursement provisions are expected
to increase Behavioral Health expenditures and revenue by
approximately 6% ($5 Million) each year for the next several years.After implementation of ACA is complete, the County may
recognize increased revenue of more than $20 Million for
behavioral health services. Behavioral Health will ensure that
Monterey County residents promptly receive mandated care by
ensuring there is adequate capacity to meet growing need.
CLINIC SERVICES: FY 2013-14 appropriations are recommended
at $34 million and revenues are estimated at $34 million, a decrease
of $218,102 in GFC from the FY 2012-13 Adopted Budget.
Healthy Families patients began the transition from the Healthy
Families program into Medi-Cal. As of April 2013, approximately
sixty percent have transferred to Medi-Cal, and the rest are slated
to convert to Medi-Cal in FY 2013-14.
The ACA will bring an anticipated 27,000 people onto Medi-Cal as
of January 1, 2014, and an additional 27,000 people will be eligible
to purchase health insurance through the State Health Insurance
Exchange program. The Bureau continues to work with other
safety net providers to provide additional primary care capacity for
these newly insured patients. The Bureau will undergo an
extensive remodel of the Seaside Family Health Center during this
year to increase capacity, renovate the building and improve
handicapped accessibility and parking. The opening of the
expanded Laurel Family Practice Clinic and the Bridge to Care
Clinic in Building 400, Floor Three on the Natividad Medical
Center campus is scheduled for Spring 2014. In addition, the
Department will continue to explore more cost effective means of
providing services to the safety net in the County which may
include further integration of specialty care providers within
general family practice clinical settings.
PUBLIC HEALTH: Staff worked to develop a strategy to achieve
the necessary program and budget adjustments to match GFC to
the Maintenance of Effort (MOE) amount prescribed by Health &
Safety Code Section 123940. The GFC for Children's Medical
Services was reduced from $645,875 to $609,159, achieving goal to
match GFC to MOE.Continue implementation of Strategic Plan to achieve health
outcomes for Monterey County residents focusing on development
of policies that promote healthy behaviors.
Launch re-designed bi-lingual Health Department website to
ensure immediate access to current information by the public.
Pending Issues
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH: In FY 2011-12, alcohol and drug and
mental health programs were significantly realigned from the State
to the counties. In FY 2012-13, the Bureau implemented further
changes. The Behavioral Health Bureau is anticipating further
changes due to the Affordable Care Act and has plans to further reengineer
services. The elimination of the State Departments of
Mental Health and Alcohol and Drug Programs produces
challenges but can be an opportunity for increased services
through leveraging of realigned funding with Federal Medicaid.
The realignment of the prison population, AB 109, produced a new
referral source while also being a new challenge for rehabilitative
services.
ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH: There are several areas of concern
for the Environmental Health Bureau in the immediate future
resulting from past and pending Federal and State legislation. New
legislation (AB 1616) establishing Cottage Food Operations as a
new retail food business continues to present challenges locally as
well as at the State level. An update to Public Pool regulations will
require a review of the existing inspection system and
standardization of training for staff when completed. Local
ordinances regarding single use carry-out plastic bags, landfill
development zones and illegal dumping are being drafted, updated
and/or reviewed and will require new systems for public education,
tracking and enforcement if passed. Computer upgrade purchases
are being finalized to comply with the State-mandated California
Environment Reporting System requirements, enabling businesses
to report hazardous materials inventories online. Stricter state
regulations per AB 885 for Onsite Wastewater Treatment Systems
(OWTS) could mandate significant changes to our current OWTS
program, as well as to certain Drinking Water Protection Services
program procedures. Efforts to assist water system operators in
addressing nitrate contamination in water systems serving
Disadvantaged Communities within Monterey County are ongoing.
The impact of implementing the County General Plan (GPU) 2010
will continue to involve a significant amount of staff time to create
and update ordinances and implement the GPU policy; the fiscal
impacts are as yet unknown and may be significant.
EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES: Due to ongoing discussions
at state level to utilize the Maddy Fund as a source of revenue for
the state budget deficit, there may be a loss of revenue to the EMS
Agency in the amount of approximately $229,000 and a loss to local
hospitals and Emergency Department Physician groups of
$933,750. In addition, the Emergency Medical Care Committee
may recommend changes to the EMS system that may impact EMS
expenditures.
PUBLIC GUARDIAN/ADMINISTRATOR: Public Guardian/
Administrator is anticipating continued unstable revenues in FY
2013-14. The main revenue source of this budget derives from
decedent estate/conservator fees and interest on pooled accounts.
This revenue is greatly dependent on financial markets, interest
rates, real estate market, and timing of estate producing fees. The
current decreases in interest rates and softness in the real estate
market is affecting Monterey County home sales and will affect
revenues in the coming fiscal year.
CLINIC SERVICES/PUBLIC HEALTH: With the Affordable Care
Act, counties will continue to be responsible for providing public
health services and health services to indigent adults without
private or public health care insurance coverage. It is critical for the
health and welfare of all residents that counties retain sufficient
realignment funds to deliver public health and remaining indigent
services. This is especially important in Monterey County where
13.5% of our population is undocumented and we have a large
percentage of working poor. Based on recent reports, Monterey
County has a high percentage of persons who do not qualify for
either Medicaid or subsidized health insurance due to
documentation status.
Policy Considerations
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH: Requested $1,400,000 GFC and 15 FTE
augmentation to leverage Medi-Cal and Mental Health Services
Act (MHSA) funds to provide $2.8 million in essential mental
health services to the Monterey County community.The Recommended Budget for the Department totals $211,252,335
in appropriations, financed by $203,244,521 in program revenue,
and $8,007,814 in General Fund Contribution (GFC). This
represents an increased appropriation of $36,270,730, increased
estimated revenues of $35,851,823, and an increase of General
Fund Contribution of $418,404 from the FY 2012-13 Adopted
Budget. This recommendation includes the addition of 54
positions for implementation of the Affordable Care Act of 2013.
The estimated costs of each division are as follows:
SOCIAL SERVICES OPERATIONS & ADMINISTRATION: This
component, budgeted for in Unit 8262, includes Community
Benefits, Family & Children Services, Aging & Adult Services,
CalWorks Employment Services, Human Resources, and
Administrative Services. The recommendation includes
appropriations of $106,211,069, revenues of $105,934,139, and
General Fund Contribution of $276,930 which is an increase of
$16,946,972 in appropriations, $16,881,585 in revenue, and $65,387
increase to the General Fund Contribution from the FY2012-13
Adopted Budget.
The significant change is the growth in staff for health care reform.
This recommendation includes the addition of 54 positions and
consists of the following: 24 Eligibility Worker II, eight Eligibility
worker III, five Eligibility Supervisor, two Office Assistant II, seven
Social Services Aide II, two Social Services Aide I, one Program
Manager II, and one Administrative Services Assistant for
Community Benefits; one Department Information Systems
Coordinator for Systems Support; and three Employment &
Training Worker II for CalWORKS Employment Services to
increase work participation services.
The other significant change is an increase in appropriations and
revenues due to sales tax realignment. The change is based on the
implementation of the Health & Welfare Realignment Fund 025
implemented in Fiscal Year (FY) 2012-13 to comply with new 1991
realignment accounting and funding methodologies adopted by the
State.
ENTITLEMENT PROGRAMS: Entitlement Programs, budgeted
in Units 8252, 8253, 8254, and 8255, include CalWORKs, Out-of-
Home Care, In-Home Supportive Services, and General Assistance.
The recommended budget is appropriations of $100,600,482,
revenues of $93,720,609, and General Fund Contribution of
$6,879,873. This is a $19,455,242 increase in appropriations, a
$19,145,218 increase in revenue, and a $310,024 increase in the
General Fund Contribution from the FY2012-13 Adopted Budget.
The other significant change is an increase in appropriations and
revenues due to sales tax realignment. The change is also based on
the implementation of Fund 025 to be in compliance with State law
for 1991 realignment sales tax accounting and funding
methodologies.
The increase in General Fund Contribution is primarily driven by
Unit 8253, General Assistance caseload growth and Unit 8254, In-
Home Supportive Services to respond to Board directive for the
County to contribute $0.045 cents to a $0.09 cent per hour increase
for the IHSS care providers health benefits. The Federal
government contributes the balance of the increase.
OTHER COMMUNITY PROGRAMS: This division includes
Community Action Partnership, IHSS Public Authority, Area
Agency on Aging, and Other Community Programs. The
recommended budget is appropriations of $3,663,415, revenues of
$3,195,076, and General Fund Contributions of $468,339 which is a
decrease of $158,017 in appropriations and $171,513 revenues,
with an increase of $13,496 change to General Fund Contributions
from the FY2012-13 Adopted Budget.
The significant change to Other Community Programs is that the
Homeless Prevention/Rapid Re-housing Grant that was funded
with American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA)
funds ended September 2012.
MILITARY AND VETERANS' AFFAIRS OFFICE: The
recommendation is appropriations of $777,369, revenues of
$394,697, and General Fund Contribution of $382,672 which is a
increase of $26,533 in appropriations, a decrease to revenue of
$3,467, and an increase of $30,000 to General Fund Contributions
from the FY2012-13 Adopted Budget.
The significant change to Military and Veterans' Affairs is an
increase of $30,000 in appropriations and General Fund
Contributions for the Veterans Drop-In Center needed in Unit
8260.
Budget Impacts
During the 2012-13 year, DSS staffing levels were increased by 14.0
positions to accommodate additional workload associated with the
transfer of more than 18,000 children from Healthy Families
Program to the Medi-Cal Program. The positions are funded with
State and Federal dollars.
Community Benefits has 51.0 positions for the workload associated
with the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. It is estimated
collectively both counties, Monterey and San Benito, have over
20,000 individuals that will be accessing health care. Many of the
calls will originate at the state-level call center, then once
determined to be potentially eligible for Medi-Cal, will be
transferred to the local call center currently under development.
Monterey County will handle calls for both Monterey and San
Benito County. The positions will not be filled until final funding
allocations are known. Included in the recommended
implementation is $286,000 for one-time only infrastructure costs
for workspace and computers. These costs as well will be funded
through the State and Federal government.DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES (DSS): Collaborate with
public safety and health partners to reduce youth violence and to
implement the Community Corrections Partnership plan; Increase
coordinated care with Behavioral Health for foster children and
youth at risk for out of home placement.
Additionally, the Department will continue efforts through
leadership in the County Welfare Directors Association of
California (CWDA) and the American Public Human Services
Association (APHSA) to advocate for increased regulatory
flexibility and funding to meet the needs locally of low-income
families and individuals, vulnerable children, frail seniors and
individuals living with a disability.COMMUNITY BENEFITS: Implement the Affordable Care Act
(2010)-collaborate with Natividad Medical Center (NMC) and the
County of Monterey Health Department to provide health services
for low income and working families that currently do not have
healthcare insurance. To include: develop and implement
customer access to receive CalFresh or Medi Cal benefits; opening
the Community Benefits Care Center; and the business process
changes to support the new model will be an ongoing effort for the
budget year.
Implement in compliance to legislative changes protocols, such as
the change from quarterly status updates to semi-annual reporting.
FAMILY AND CHILDREN'S SERVICES: Implement compliance
with a request received from the California Department of Social
Services (CDSS) to focus System Improvement Plan (SIP) efforts on
reducing the time between entry into foster care and the
reunification of children with their families when safe to do so.
California as a State has not met the Federal requirements for
improvement on this outcome. As part of the process, department
management and supervisors will review and analyze the current
"Time to Reunification" outcomes. Upon completion of this
analysis, the staff will propose a plan to improve local outcomes to
help the State pass this Federal outcome criteria.
CALWORKS EMPLOYMENT SERVICES: Increase the work
participation rate required by State and Federal statutes by: refining
and expanding the wage subsidy program; provide re-engagement
services to customers who were deferred from participating in
work activities due to state budget reductions; and increase the
number of customers placed in wage-paying jobs to improve family
income and self-sufficiency.
AGING AND ADULT SERVICES: Continue the strategic
planning process that began in 2011 to redesign the Aging and
Adult Services branch to better serve its clients and customers. The
staff will enhance efforts to provide Information and Assistance
(I&A) services that are customized personal linkages to community
resources for the aging and disabled population. The goal is to have
the capacity to attend to individual requests.
Implement a new statewide automated system for In Home
Supportive Services (IHHS) payroll and reports by November 2013.
Pending Issues
CalWORKS/TANF: Re-engagement of CalWORKs recipients who
were granted deferrals due to state budget reductions. Efforts are
underway to ensure that recipients are placed in eligible work
activities so that work readiness skills are developed and that time
limited benefits mitigated.
IN HOME SUPPORTIVE SERVICES (IHSS): The IHSS program
has had numerous changes in the past few years to contain costs
during the budget crisis. Recent court rulings will reduce assessed
hours by 4.7% in Fiscal Year (FY) 2013-14. In addition, due to
budget agreements last year, the county has a Maintenance of Effort
for the IHSS program that includes Public Authority, health
benefits, IHSS Administration and IHSS paid hours on behalf of
program recipients.
The statewide Case Management Information Payroll System
(CMIPS) will be replaced during this budget year. The conversion
date for the county is November 4th, 2013. Staff will be responsible
for case conversion as well as learning the new system and
processes that accompany this automated system.
MEDI-CAL: Implementation of the Affordable Care Act of 2010
(ACA). Preparation includes implementation of a call center to
handle the additional volume of calls that will be received;
implementation of the Community Benefit Care Contact Center by
August 2013 to process ACA applications by October 2013;
changes in business processes for Eligibility staff in performing
eligibility related functions and guiding clients and customers
through the health insurance plan; and the delay in the
implementation of required automation interfaces that will impact
efficiencies and effectiveness in the ACA processes.
The impact of the workload transfer of (approximately 19,000
children) from the Healthy Family Program to Medi-Cal; which
required adding additional staff during FY 2012-13.
CALFRESH: The increase in the number of individuals and
families receiving nutritional assistance in response to a statewide
outreach to inform the public about the availability of the program
for low income working adults and families.
OUT OF HOME CARE: Foster Care and related programs were
part of the Public Safety Realignment Act of 2011. Under the new
provisions counties pay all of the non-federal costs associated with
the programs through receipt of sales tax revenues, which are to
offset the former State share of the programs.
CHILD WELFARE SERVICES: Activities and services related to
this program were also part of the Public Safety Realignment Act of
2011. The State General Fund (SGF) contributions have been
eliminated and replaced with a portion of sales tax that is divided
into many parts to fund a variety of programs. if the sales tax
receipts are less than prior years, this may impact the program.
The Fiscal Year (FY) 2013-14 County Library Recommended
Budget appropriations increased by $180,169, an approximately
2.3% increase over the FY 2012-13 Adopted Budget.
Salaries and Benefits increased by $184,991, an approximately 3.7%
increase over FY 2012-13. An increase salaries occurred, while
utilizing temporary employees for the Library's Homework Center
Program.
Services and supplies increased by $65,619, an approximately 2.9%
increase over the FY 2012-13 Adopted Budget, this was due to
increases in the following: books and periodicals, computer
software, computer hardware, equipment and furnishings, as well
as employee training. Decreases occurred in temporary help
services and vehicle motor pool.
In the FY 2013-14 Recommended Budget only one year of the
overall AT&T total contract cost is projected $17,610, as the
majority of the cost was already incorporated in the FY 2012-13
Adopted Budget to cover the full five year term.
The County Library has adopted a Strategic Plan which will seek
alternative and diversified sources of funding to supplement its
budget in order to fill the growing gap between fiscal resources and
community needs. Demand for library services remains high, and
as a result the majority of the County Library's budget goes to
maintaining multiple locations. Due to budgetary constraints the
Library's staffing, books, computers and other library materials are
limited. The County Library continually seeks new ways to
minimize the imbalance between revenues and the added increased
expenditures. The County Library will collaborate with various
Library Friends groups and the Foundation for Monterey County
Free Library on fundraising events, grant applications and outreach
to attempt to increase their funding contributions. Additionally, the
Library will actively seek to obtain grants/donations for ongoing
programs.
The FY 2013-14 Recommended Budget Revenue is projected to
increase over the FY 2012-13 Adopted Budget. This is due to
increases occurring in Property Tax Revenue, as well as a projected
refund from the Redevelopment Property Tax Trust Fund.
The recommended budget provides for maintaining Library
Services at basic levels for the 2013-2014 fiscal year.
Demand for library services remain high because the prolonged
economic challenges and because of lack of alternative resources in
many of the communities MCFL serves. The majority of MCFL's
budget goes toward maintaining multiple locations and for staff
salaries; resources for the purchase of books, computers and other
library materials remain limited.
Keeping the two Managing Librarian positions vacant for an
extended period of time has helped build the fund balance for the
library. The temporary closure of two branches, though having a
negative effect on MCFL's ability to provide service, has
contributed to narrowing the budget gap. Continued deferred
maintenance contributed to the temporary closure of these two
branches.
MCFL continues to seek ways to minimize the imbalance between
revenues and the increased expenditures while simply maintaining
service levels. The change in Redevelopment Agency (RDA)
property tax impacts have resulted in a slight increase in the
property tax income for the Library and in 2013-2014 MCFL is
cautiously starting the process of gradually restoring services and
programs that had been cut back to appropriate levels.During FY 2013-14, MCFL will continue to meet the Board of
Supervisors' Strategic Initiatives and Key Objectives through
meeting the following goals:
Continue the planning and construction of the new the San Lucas
library and seek options for replacing the currently closed Parkfield
library.
Explore options for expanding the Family Place program to other
branches.
Continue to work with the Cities of Gonzales and Seaside in their
pursuit of new library buildings.
Complete the organizational restructuring and library job
classification study.
Continue to implement the 2013-2016 MCFL Strategic Plan with a
focus on equity of services, efficiency, sustainability, and
responding to community needs, including reevaluating programs
and services, seeking diversified and stable funding sources, and
focusing on staff retention, hiring and training.
Pending Issues
Planning and reconstruction of the new San Lucas branch library is
underway.
The Parkfield branch library is currently closed and a new facility is
needed to adequately serve this remote and isolated community.
MCFL will be exploring options for replacing this building and
providing service to this remote community which has very limited
service options.Promote the economic sustainability of the County's economic
base from the agricultural industry by conducting research to solve
current pest problems. Provide diagnostic services that lead to the
discovery of new diseases that can be stopped before they spread.
Provide anti-bioterrorism diagnostic services for the agricultural
industry. Maintain and enhance the resources of the region by
conducting food safety (E. coli) research for local growing
conditions.
ENOTOMOLOGY RESEARCH PROGRAM: Research will
continue to focus on understanding the biology and management
of root maggots on lettuce and brassicas. Projects will also examine
ways to improve monitoring and management of springtails and
symphylans in the Salinas Valley.
PLANT PATHOLOGY RESEARCH PROGRAM: Continue to
investigate and study the two new strawberry diseases
(Macrophomina, Fusarium) that are now in Monterey County.
Continue surveying, detecting, and identifying the races of spinach
donwy mildew. Study the causes of root rot disease of spinach
which appears to be increasing on the coast.
IRRIGATION AND WATER QUALITY RESEARCH PROGRAM:
Continue to conduct trials identifying lettuce varieties tolerant to
low water and low nitrogen conditions. Evaluate the use of
denitrification bioreactors for reducing nitrate concentrations in
the tile drainage water. Evaluate the use of organic materials for
sequestering pesticides in irrigation run-off.
VEGETABLE AND WEED SCIENCE RESEARCH PROGRAM:
Develop information on the efficient nitrogen fertilization of cool
season vegetables to assist growers comply with the new
restrictions on the use of fertilizer by the Regional Water Quality
Control Board. Develop an effective last season weed control
system for cool and warm season vegetables to reduce weeding
costs and safeguard yield. The uptake of nitrogen by vegetables to
provide information to help growers better manage nitrogen needs
of vegetables. Evaluate an effective system for reducing the nitrate
content of tile drain water that flows to the Marine Sanctuary.
VITICULTURE RESEARCH PROGRAM: Evaluate the effects of
plant material and vine training methods to promote the early
development of vineyards to increase vine productivity. Continue
long-term studies evaluating cultivar selections and rootstocks for
their performance under local conditions. Evaluate and
demonstrate the value of resistance management programs to
improve the control of powdery mildew in coastal vineyards.
Improve the quality of life for the County's youth, seniors and
families by training adult volunteers to work directly with youth.
Provide opportunities for youth to become engaged in positive,
research-based activities and develop responsibility and leadership
through community service. Train Master Gardener volunteers
who conduct community enhancement service projects.
Maintain and enhance the natural resources of the County by:
Providing information through classes, workshops, newsletters,
personal consultations and web-site that leads to the use of softer
or less chemicals for pest control or effective alternatives to
chemical controls. Provide farmers and policy makers unbiased,
research-based information. Develop alternatives to pesticides that
might degrade water quality or air quality.The Recommended Budget for the department totals $12,976,916
in appropriations, financed by $11,344,766 in program revenue,
$1,624,938 in General Fund Contribution (GFC).
Significant areas of changes in appropriations are a combination of
new or increased Countywide allocations such as the Building Use
Allowance Allocation for $59,480 and a 72% increase in General
Liability Insurance Non-Recoverable in Parks General Fund 001.
The anticipated revenue was decreased from previous years
budgets in order to more accurately reflect the ongoing trend in
reduced park visitation and low water levels expected at the lakes
during the season 2013.
Budget Impacts
In order to meet the recommended GFC target for FY 2013-14, this
budget includes salar y savings and a reduction to the
appropriations for Buildings & Maintenance budgets throughout
the parks. Both staff shortages and lack of available maintenance
budgets may impact the department's ability to operate at the
current level of service.
Many of the parks facilities and parks assets have outlived their
usefulness and are serving years beyond their expected life. The
cost to repair or upgrade continues to rise as maintenance
continues to be deferred rather than being addressed as the needs
become apparent.
Understanding the implications of ongoing deferred maintenance
includes both deferral caused by years of negligence due to the lack
of funding but also deferral due to unforeseen expenses or
impending needs that deplete budget appropriations for unplanned
projects.
Crucial needs without a dedicated funding source, as well as safety
or compliance features such as Americans with Disability Act
(ADA) compliance will still have to be paid out of the parks
operating budgets. Over time, the quality of services will decline as
the facilities exhibit the results of normal wear and tear.Parks in order to develop modernized business tools that will assist
the department to sustain a revenue driven model.
Asses all current parks contracts and agreements in order to
develop Best Management Practices internally for the Parks staff.
Aggressively seek strategies to spotlight and market the day-use
and camping opportunities within the General Fund parks. The
target audience includes county residents, tourists and visitors to
Monterey County. Strategies will include expansion of internet
based tools such as social media, usage of current technologies and
collaborative efforts with community partners such as SCRAMP.
In FY 2013-14, the department will work to create measurable
indicators to quantify and communicate the impact of our Parks.
Implement Target Safety Program, an online training for all park
employees regarding on-the-job safety guidelines and policy for all
parks staff.
Implement Next Generation Radio program in the North County.
Complete the conversion to internet based, online reservation
system in order to increase customer service offerings and
exposure to the Park`s amenities.
Begin the process to vet the installation and implementation of
Automated Pay Stations throughout the North County park
facilities.
Maintain standards and continue to implement improvements that
provide top quality customer service throughout the Parks System
and ensure that the County values are incorporated in all aspects of
the department policies, procedures and employee training.
Identify and prioritize major maintenance, deferred maintenance,
and infrastructure improvements throughout the park system. The
majority of these improvements will not have identified funding. It
will be necessary to vet any potential sources to help fund
infrastructure improvements, as well as to investigate and develop
new revenue resources to maximize the profitability of the park
operations.
Work in collaboration with other County departments and outside
agencies to explore and build on public/private, public/public, and
public/non-profit partnerships the contracted management firm to
upgrade facilities as may be possible in order to best maximize
profits and operating efficiency.The Fiscal Year (FY) 2013-14 Recommended Budget for the
Monterey County Water Resources Agency (MCWRA) programs is
$24,099,029. Anticipated revenues are $23,275,267 and the use of
$823,762 in fund balance will provide a statutorily balanced budget.
Budgeted unassigned fund balances at 6/30/2014 are anticipated to
be $12,805,783.
Salaries and Benefits increased by $162,610, a 3.1% increase from
the FY 2012-13 Adopted Budget. The increase is due to fully
funding a partially funded position and increased medical
insurance costs.
Services and Supplies decreased by $993,795, a 5.6% decrease from
the FY 2012-13 Adopted Budget. This is primarily due to a
decrease in consultant and legal costs.
Capital Assets increased by $2,355,789 from the FY 2012-13
Adopted Budget. The Pajaro Bench Excavation Project Phase II
accounts for $2,100,000 of the increase. This is fully funded by
grant revenue.
Revenue increased by $2,039,040, an approximately 9.6% increase
from the FY 2012-13 Adopted Budget. The primary driver for
increased revenue are grants related to the Pajaro Bench
Excavation Project increasing Intergovernmental revenue by
$2,174,261, cost of living adjustments of 2.4% on assessments and
water delivery charges of $312,310.
Though MCWRA budget is statutorily balanced, the budget fails to
meet the County of Monterey financial guideline of a structurally
balanced budget. A structurally balanced budget matches total
ongoing expenditures to the annual ongoing revenues by individual
fund, rendering an ongoing sustainable budget. MCWRA
recognizes that a transition period will be required to acheive a
structural balanced budget. The Agency is working on interim and
long-term strategic plans to meet County Fiscal Guidelines where
fund balances are not used to sustain ongoing operations. The
strategic plan will consider organizational restructuring with a
focus on service level and financial sustainability, as well as fund
balance growth and positive cash balances.
Staff positions for the FY 2013-14 Recommended Budget are
recommended at 55 positions.
Budget Impacts
FY 2013-14 Nacimiento and San Antonio Lakes Fuel Spill Clean-up
Project costs, except for Agency reimburseable labor, are not
included in the budget, since the contractor will be paid directly by
the County.
Negotiations are expected to result in a Nacimiento Hydroelectric
Plant rate increase by August 2013. Any delay may have a negative
impact on the budget.
There are no expenditures relating to contesting the Water Rights
Permit 11043 revocation in the FY 2013-14 Budget. It is
anticipated that the initial costs will be incurred in FY 2012-13.
Develop and implement a strategy to obtain consensus for Cost -of-
Living- Allowance (COLA) increases on assessment rates for Zones
of Benefit.
Finalize an Electric Power Sale Agreement.
Develop a strategy to move forward with a Salinas River Channel
Maintenance Program.
Resolve water rights and audit issues with the Monterey Regional
Water Pollution Control Authority (MRWPCA) including
expansion of the Castroville Seawater Intrusion Project (CSIP).
Participate in the Water Rights Permit 11043 revocation hearing.
Develop a strategic plan for resolving reservoir real property issues.
Establish a sustainable funding source or alternative requirement
for Salinas Valley Water Project fish monitoring.
Development of an interim and long-term strategic plan to render
MCWRA structurally balanced, where expenditures are matched
with estimated revenue. MCWRA structure focus is to meet
County Financial Guidelines and ongoing operations are
sustainable and not reliant on fund balance and one-time source of
funds.Fiscal Year (FY) 2013-14 expenses are budgeted based on FY 2012-
13 activities through December 2012, and annualized for the 12
month fiscal year. To appropriately reflect expected future
expenditures, annualized amounts are normalized by excluding
one-time events and adjusting for anticipated expenses.
Expenditures for FY 2013-14 are budgeted at $189,728,086 a
$6,945,351 decrease compared to the FY 2012-13 Adopted Budget,
which is an approximately 4% decrease.
Salaries and Employee Benefits are budgeted at $103,465,824, a
decrease of $2,672400 compared to the FY 2012-13 Adopted
Budget; representing an approximately 2.5% decrease. The main
drivers for the decrease: aggressive reduction strategies for
premium pays, such as overtime, unscheduled shift premiums,
productivity increases, and improved reporting. These drivers are
used to counterbalance labor cost increases realized through salary
step increases; rising insurance costs; introduction of new
programs and service lines, such as Neurology, Dermatology, a 24
hour pharmacy program, and an expanding Family Practice
Residency Program; increases in quality assurance resources,
electronic health records implementation; and other support
functions. Associated with meeting the expanded services, there
will be an increase in employed and contracted physicians.
Services and Supplies decreased by $1,892,687 compared to the FY
2012-13 Adopted Budget, which represents an approximately 3.2%
decrease. The main drivers for the decreases in Services and
Supplies: reduced County allocation costs for insurance, telecom
and other services captured in the Monterey Countywide Cost
Allocation Plan (COWCAP); reduction in legal fees due to the
conclusion of several major projects; a decrease in advertising;
employee travel; education expenses; and a reduction in medical
supply cost due to renegotiated contracts and cost saving efforts.
NMC continues to fight inflationary cost pressures from healthcare
IT systems, maintenance and licensing; pharmaceutical drugs;
utilities; and meeting healthcare reform compliance requirements.
Other Charges decreased $62,058 from FY 2012-13 Adopted
Budget. The charges represent Certificate of Participation series
principle and interest payments.Capital Assets decreased by $2,381,888 compared to the FY 2012-
13 Adopted Budget, an approximately 11% decrease. The Building
and Improvement budget of $6,154,562 represents projects the
Board of Supervisors Capital Improvement Committee (CIC) has
prioritized and the Budget Committee approved funding. Projects
include building construction and renovation. The Equipment
budget represents both Equipment and Information and
Technology and basically shares equally a $12,906,021 budget.
FY 2013-14 revenues are budgeted at $172,537,007, an $11,354,982
decrease compared to the FY 2012-13 Adopted Budget, rendering
an approximately 6% decrease. Revenue from Charges for Services,
essentially fees & services, decreased $7,986,849 compared to the
FY 2012-13 Adopted Budget. The decrease is a result of
commercial insurance companies changes in two significant areas:
(1) reduction in reimbursement rates; and (2) a shift among major
payors rendering a lower percentage of activity from the
commercial insurance business sector. This latter impact was a
consequence of negotiations with a commercial insurance
company, where there was an out-of-contract period.
Intergovernmental Revenues decreased by $ 3,368,133 compared to
the FY 2012-13 Adopted Budget; representing an approximately
8.2% decrease. Due to Healthcare Reform, revenue contributions
from specific government programs have shifted considerably.
Budget Impacts
NMC submitted a letter of intent to be designated as a level II
trauma center. The designation will require specialized and
experienced multidisciplinary treatment and resources.Strategic Direction: Based on changing community demographics,
