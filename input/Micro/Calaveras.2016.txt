The County Administrative Office provides support for the implementation of the Board of
Supervisors’ adopted policies, goals and objectives for the county. Staff has the overall
responsibility for developing, administering and managing the county budget; implements
countywide administrative policies; plans and implements capital improvement projects;
administers special grants and projects; and acts as the purchasing agent on behalf of the
county. The County Administrative Office is responsible for Human Resources/Risk
Management, Technology Services, Airport, Museum/County Archives, the Public, Educational
and Governmental Access Commission/Public Access Television (PEG TV), County Fire,
Community Organizations, Grand Jury, Non-departmental and Capital Improvement Program
budgets.
Responsibility for Facilities will return to the Administrative Office effective FY 16/17.
Departmental Budget Request:
The Department’s Requested Budget of $811,342 represents an increase of $107,605, or 13.3%,
in expenditures and an overall decrease of ($171,742) or (57.9)% in revenues when compared
to the FY 2015/16 Final Budget. As a result, the Net County Cost / General Fund Contribution is
increased by $279,257 or 54.3%.
Revenues: Factors Contributing to Significant Revenue Changes
The County’s A-87 Cost Allocation Plan is approved by the State Controller and reflects costs
incurred by central service departments, which support overall countywide departmental
service delivery. Costs for providing specific administrative services are reimbursed two years
in arrears through A-87 charge backs. The Administration budget for FY 2016/17 reflects a
decrease of ($197,044) in A-87 Indirect Cost Plan revenues.
Expenditures: Factors Contributing to Significant Expenditure Changes:
• Salaries and Benefit costs increased $107,908 as a result of the 27th payroll and
negotiated health insurance increases.
• Salaries and Benefits also include $25,000 of extra hire Public Information Officer (PIO)
costs for continuing Butte Fire recovery and permanent work.
Pending Issues and Policy Considerations:
• Continuous budget analysis, monitoring and economic forecasting for short and long
range budget management and accountability has become the norm and requires
intensive amounts of staff time.
• The first phase of the ADA modifications to the Legal Building and the remodeling of
County Counsel office space have been re-budgeted in the Capital Improvement
Projects budget for FY 2016-17. These modifications will allow for the relocation of
Human Resources to the Legal Building facilitating the merger of Human Resources and
Risk Management with the Administrative Office.

The Department’s Requested Budget of $56,681 represents an overall decrease of $1,803,100,
or 97%, in expenditures and an overall decrease of ($508,454), or (2.1%), in revenues when
compared to FY 2015/16 Final Budget. As a result, the Net County Cost / General Fund
Contribution has decreased by ($1,294,646), or (5.8%).
Factors contributing to significant expenditure changes include:
? A decrease of ($125,000) in Transfers to Designated Fund, due to the elimination of a
$125,000 transfer for costs of the 27th paycheck. FY 2016/17 includes the 27th pay date.
Transfers to this designated fund will restart in FY 2017-18.
? A decrease of ($100,000) for Transfer to Designated Fund for deferred maintenance to
Government Center Buildings that was included in the FY 2015/16 Budget. This may be
included at final budget.
? A decrease of ($1,573,000) for Information Technology infrastructure projects, the
unspent portion at fiscal year end was re-budgeted for FY 2016-17 in Capital Projects.
Factors contributing to significant revenue changes include:
? A decrease of ($120,274) in Supplemental Current Secured Property Tax Revenues
based decreases in the property tax roll due to the Butte Fire.
? A decrease of ($400,941) in the Sales and Use Tax In-Lieu. This was tied to the triple
flip institute by the State in 2004 that is now expiring.
? An increase of $50,000 in Sales and Use Tax based on current trends. This is expected
to continue through FY 2016-17 due to Butte Fire recovery work.
? An increase of $69,000 in Franchise Fee Revenue, a $25,000 increase from PG&E and
a $44,000 increase in Cable TV Franchise Fees.
? A decrease of $36,019 in State SB 90 Mandated Costs. No repayment of prior years’
mandated costs were included in the State Budget for FY 2016-17.
? An increase of $128,790 in Transfers from Designated Fund. This includes the annual
Teeter allocation of $500,000, a transfer of $250,000 from the 27th Pay date Designated
Fund to ensure all cost related to that payroll are covered in departmental budgets, and
a Teeter transfer in the amount of $1,849,513 to close the budget deficit gap.
Pending Issues and Policy Considerations
Although the FY 2016-17 Recommended Budget projects no change to the property tax
assessment rolls, the actual change will not be known until the assessment roll is closed at the
end of July. Anticipated revenues may require further adjustment at Final Budget. Additionally,
based on the close of the FY 2015/16 budget, actual fund equity balance may change.

Departmental Budget Request
The Department’s Requested Budget of $304,131,308 represents an overall increase of
$11,623, or 3.8%, in expenditures and no change in revenues when compared to FY 2015/16
Final Budget. As a result, the Net County Cost/General Fund Contribution increased $11,623 or
3.8%.
Factors contributing to significant expenditure changes include:
? Funding of $39,809 has been included Federal Forest Reserve Title III projects. The
offsetting revenue is budgeted in the Non-Departmental Budget (10100040).
? The required Administrative Match for the Area 12 Agency on Aging increased $2,625.
Pending Issues and Policy Considerations
An appropriation of $15,000 for Common Grounds Senior Service for the Meals on Wheels
program and $3,500 for the Calaveras Senior Center is included in the budget.

Responsibility for Facilities will move from Public Works to the Administrative Office effective
FY 2016/17. The Facilities budget encompasses three distinct functions: facilities and grounds
maintenance, oversight of CGL|Kitchell contract and custodial services.
On May 24th, 2016, the Board of Supervisors approved the reclassification of a full time
Facilities Administrative Analyst to a full time Facilities Manager. The Facilities Manager is
responsible for the coordination of construction, installation, maintenance and repair of County
buildings, facilities and grounds; facilities and grounds project management; and supervision of
the maintenance and custodial staff.
Two facilities maintenance workers maintain the buildings and grounds for all county owned
properties and facilities except the new Jail and Sheriff’s Office which are covered by the
CGL|Kitchell contract. They also maintain several leased properties that county staff occupies
such as the Public Works yards and the branch libraries. Maintenance includes lights, plumbing,
electrical, HVAC, roof leaks, window leaks, broken windows, and other miscellaneous repairs.
In a continued effort to be more efficient, facilities staff utilizes the County help desk ticketing
system. This system has simplified the process for identifying maintenance issues and provides
staff a way to prioritize maintenance requests.
Custodial Services consists of seven full-time employees. Custodial staff are responsible for all
buildings at Government Center as well as all off campus buildings in San Andreas, with the
exception of the CalWorks & Human Services Agency. The Custodial Staff also service the Jail
and Sheriff’s Office. Staff is responsible for annual carpet cleaning, vinyl floor striping and
waxing, securing all Government Center buildings after business hours, and locking and
unlocking the Board of Supervisors chambers after hours for community groups that have
reserved the chambers after regular business hours.
Departmental Budget Request
The Facilities FY 16/17 Recommended Budget of $1,269,683 represents an overall increase of
$51,334, or 4%, in expenditures and an increase of $52,737, or 11%, when compared to FY
15/16.
As a result, the General Fund Contribution decreased by ($1,406) for a total contribution of
$789,078 when compared to FY 15/16.
Factors Contributing to Significant Expenditure Changes
Salary and Benefits
• An increase of $31,410 in Salaries and Benefit costs due to additional
costs of the 27th payroll and negotiated health insurance increases.
Services and Supplies
• Increase in Profession and Specialized Services of $66,683 for the
CGL|Kitchell contract for Jail and Sheriff’s Office maintenance.
Factors Contributing to Significant Revenue Changes
• Increase to A-87 Revenue of $21,562.
Pending Issues and Policy Considerations
Deferred maintenance at Government Center is a major concern. The brick facade is failing, the
buildings are in need of paint, the roof structures need replacing, and landscaping has been
minimal. Most of the mechanical systems on campus are past their useful life and require
expensive repairs and maintenance.
Attached to this memo is a table identifying the highest priority deferred maintenance items
including roofing replacement/repairs and HVAC system maintenance or replacement. This
high priority deferred list of work is in excess of $1,000,00.00
The Facilities staff do a remarkable job keeping old systems operating, and coordinating
emergency repairs with very limited funds.

Departmental Budget Request
The Department’s Requested Budget of $35,915 represents an increase of $1,004, or 3%, in
expenditures and an overall increase of $1,004, or 34%, in revenues when compared to FY
2015/16 Final Budget. As per Budget Instructions, there is no increase to the General Fund
Contribution as compared to FY 2015/2016.
Pending Issues and Policy Consideration
The County currently has a contract with the Calaveras County Historical Society to operate the
Museum on the County’s behalf in the amount of $500 per month ($6,000/year).

The Department’s Requested Budget of $1,323,333 represents an overall decrease of
($38,480), or (2.9%), in expenditures and an overall increase of $103,333, or 8, in revenues
when compared to FY 2015/16 Final Budget. There is no Net County Cost / General Fund
Contribution to the Airport budget. The County Airport is a self-sustaining Enterprise Fund.
Factors contributing to significant expenditure changes include:
? An decrease of ($23,003) in A-87 Costs.
? A increase of $185,000 in airport layout plan capital project
Factors contributing to significant revenue changes include:
None.
Pending Issues and Policy Considerations
The Airport manager has been working with the Federal Aviation Administration, and Mead and
Hunt who has designed, Airport Runway Improvements and Taxiway Rehabilitation. These
improvements include: runway edge lighting, counterpoise lighting protection system, upgrade
electrical homerun, a new PAPI on each end of the runway, replacement of REILs, and
replacement of supplemental wind cones. The Airport received an Airport Improvement Program
Grant from the FAA in fiscal year 2015/16 and will continue additional monies in FY 16/17 to
complete the project.
The Airport will receive additional money from the FAA to update the Airport Layout Plan. The
County match of the Airport Layout Plan is 10% from the Airport Designated Fund. This project
will be completed in FY 16/17.

The Department’s Requested Budget of $3,324,175 represents an decrease of
($894,210), or (21.2%), in expenditures and an increase of $655,011 or 26.5% in
revenue when compared to FY2014/15 Final Budget. This budget unit has no Net
County Cost/General Fund Contribution.

PENDING ISSUES AND POLICY CONSIDERATIONS
The cost for the Phase I Remodel of the Old Courthouse was re-budgeted in FY
2016/17. This was necessary due to the delay in reissuing the RFP as a base bid with
bid-adds due to the Butte Fire. This project is being re-evaluated as to the scope and
changes to the order of the phases.

Departmental Budget Request
The Department’s Requested Budget of $11,913 represents an overall decrease of ($449), or
(4%) in expenditures compared to FY 2015/16 Final Budget. There is no General Fund
Contribution to the Parks and Recreation Budget. Estimated Fund Equity at June 30, 2016 is
$11,853.
Pending Issues and Policy Considerations
Funds in the Parks and Recreation budget are to cover the cost of any necessary repairs to
Proposition 40 projects and the lease for White Pines Park related to a Proposition 40 project.

Budget Impact
The increase of salaries and benefits ($25,314) and the expiration of the SilkRoad software maintenance contract (-$72,600), along with the decrease in A-87 funding (-$21,255), and the additional financial impact of negotiating all bargaining agreements beginning March, 2017 ($15,000) has resulted in a decrease of $26,051 to the Human Resources budget.
Human Resources is a service department that provides customer service to a County workforce of 540 allocated positions, 471 employees, 115 extra-hire employees, and 450 volunteers. While the County continues to struggle with the impacts of the Butte Fire, the services, programs, vendors, insurance, legal requirements, risk management programs, employee benefits, and assistance provided to employees, managers, department heads, and the public continues to expand.
So far in FY 2015/16, Human Resources have seen an increase in applications, interviews and orientations.
Pending Issues and Policy Considerations
With the recent hiring of a Deputy CAO/Director, Human Resources and Risk Management, an array of written processes, policies and procedures will be revised and/or created to better serve County management and employees.
As we look forward to 2016/17, emphasis will be placed upon department support, workforce efficiencies, identifying and providing training needed to support County management staff.
New Legislation
Affordable Care Act (ACA) developments, including tax requirements and the required 1095-C form, Cadillac Tax preparation and monitoring of part-time and temporary employee hours to ensure we are in compliance in offering medical insurance once thresholds are met.
Healthy Workplace Healthy Families - guarantees all American workers the right to earn paid sick days whether they are full-time, part-time or temporary.
AB 970 - Enforcement of Employee Claims by Labor Commissioner (Effective 1/1/2016) which expands the power of the Labor Commissioner to enforce local laws regarding overtime hours or minimum wage provisions and issue citations and penalties for violations.
AB 987 - Employment Discrimination (effective 1/1/2016) makes it illegal to retaliate or discriminate against an employee for requesting an accommodation for a disability or religious belief or observance, regardless of whether the request was granted.
SB 501 - Wage Garnishment Restrictions (effective 7/1/2016) amends the previous Code of Civil Procedure to reduce the prohibited amount of an individual judgement debtor's weekly disposable earnings subject to levy under an earnings withholding order from exceeding the lesser of 25% of the individuals weekly disposable earnings or 50% of the amount by which the individuals disposable earnings for the week exceed 40 times the state minimum hourly wage.
SB 579 - Employee time Off (effective 1/1/2016) Labor Code Section 230.8 prohibits discharging or discriminating against an employee who is a parent, guardian, or grandparent having custody of a child in a licensed "child day care facility" or in kindergarten or grades 1 to 12, inclusive, for taking off up to 40 hours of unpaid time off each year for the purpose of participating in school activities, subject to specified conditions. It also amends Labor Code Section 233 (aka "California Kin Care Law", which applies to all employers and allows employees to use one-half of their accrued sick leave to care for a family member. In other words, employees may use paid sick leave for their own health condition or preventative care; a family member's health condition or preventative care; if the employee is a victim of domestic assault, sexual violence, and/or stalking and needs to take time off. Further, "family member" now includes: a child regardless of age or dependency (including adopted, foster, step, or legal ward); parent (biological, adoptive, foster, step, in-law, or registered domestic partner's parent); spouse; registered domestic partner; grandparent; grandchild; or siblings.
California Fair Wage Act of 2016 (aka "$15 Minimum Wage Incentive" or "Raise California's Wage and Paid Sick Days Act") - On March 26, 2016, California legislators proposed legislation which, if approved, would raise the statewide minimum wage gradually until it reaches $15 in 2022.
New FLSA Overtime Rules: It has been two years since President Obama directed the Secretary of Labor to "modernize and streamline" federal overtime rules to extend overtime protection to millions more workers. Last June the DOL proposed new rules that would entitle some 5 million additional workers to overtime pay under the FLSA. Most significant would be to double the salary level threshold, below which salaried employees are eligible for overtime pay, from the present $23,600 per year to $50,440. Finalization was to take place in 2016 but issues arose and the DOL could not meet the deadline. The White House and congressional Republicans will keep communication channels open in this election year and perhaps agree to delay implementation until the next president in 2017. 
The FY 2016/17 recommended budget request for Insurance includes the following significant changes

The goal is maintain adequate financial reserves to protect the County against any unknown and unpredictable monetary demands in any given fiscal year. If the recommended status quo budget request was taken, the proposed budget would not have adequate funding levels to sustain our critical insurance premiums exposing the County to risks.
Furthermore, with the addition of crucial extra-hire employees to cover Butte Fire related efforts, it is unknown when their employment will end and whether they will be eligible to obtain unemployment benefits from the County.
Pending Issues and Policy Considerations
In coordination with the Auditor-Controller's Office, the division continues to monitor the impacts of the Affordable Care Act and participate in implementation of required processes.

Information Technology has responsibility for the Duplication (10100090) budget unit which is used to allocate costs for copiers utilized by a number of County departments.
Departments participating in the centrally managed Duplication Fund are charged a flat rate per copy made, with a difference in rate for Black and White / Color copies. Departments are direct billed for copies that their department generated.
Revenues generated offset costs for operation, maintenance, supplies and staffing. Revenues generated in excess of these operational costs are transferred each year to Duplicating Fund 5474. This fund is designated as a capital replacement fund to acquire new Copiers when needed. Based on budgeted revenues and expenditures, it is estimated that 2016-17 will transfer an additional 8k to the capital replacement fund.
In FY2015-16, the duplication capital replacement fund was used to purchase copiers for Admin, Sheriff’s Office, and recently for HR. At beginning of current fiscal year, the replacement fund had 94k available. By the end of current year, the fund is anticipated to have 39k, inclusive of proceeds that will be transferred to the fund from Duplication Charges that departments pay.
In the first half of FY2016-17, IT will work with a Copier Provider to do a health-check on all copiers that participate in the fund. Based on the age, ongoing use, and overall condition of each machine, we will develop long range plans for potential replacements.
During FY2016-17, IT will evaluate current per page fee structure that is charged to each of departments who participate in the fund. 
Information Technology has responsibility for the Mail Postage (10100240) budget unit which is used to allocate costs for postage, general Mail services, staff time and the operation and maintenance of equipment. Expenses for U.S. postage, FedEx, and UPS shipping used by departments are included in this budget. These costs are recovered by directly billing each department for postage and shipping costs on a monthly basis.
The 2016-17 Budget Request provides for a net budget of zero with revenues matching expenses.
The Mail account uses funds in the budget to purchase postage that is loaded on the mail machine. This pre-paid postage is drawn down as departments use the mail machine to add postage to their mail.
Current year and prior year, purchases of postage from the account have been 100k or slightly above. An ongoing goal is to have adequate postage on the meter to always be able to support current needs. IT works with departments and budgets according to information provided from departments on their anticipated changes to mailing from year to year.
Non-postage expenses for the Account are planned at 14.5k, inclusive of 4.7k funding from A-87. Incurred expenses are primarily from wages for staff that process mail, and maintenance costs for the mail machine.
IT will bill departments on a monthly basis for postage that they have used on the Mail Machine in prior month. IT will also bill a pro-rated portion of the annual non-postage expenses to the departments.
IT requests 100k for purchase of pre-paid postage for the mail machine. Final Budget will review remaining postage and determine if adjustments need to be made to postage.
A-87 revenue will be 5k in FY2016-17 vs 15.6k in current year. Current plans are to eliminate use of A-87 revenue for mail, beginning in FY2017-18. 
Information Technology has responsibility for the Communications (10100170) budget unit which is used to allocate costs related to general telecommunications operations and maintenance for the County. Costs are recovered by directly billing each department for the department’s allocated share of communications costs.
The 2016-17 Budget Request provides for a net budget of zero with revenues matching expenses.
Expenses are incurred for
o Telecom vendor charges for County wide data and telephone o Internet vendor charges to provide business internet to County o Wages for staff that support Communications
A-87 revenue offsets 21k of total expenditures for Communications. Net of applying A- 87, Communications related expenses are estimated to be 61.5k.
IT will bill departments on a monthly basis for Communications charges incurred. Charges will be allocated on a prorated basis based on number of telephones used and number of computers using the network.
Departmental charges for Communications have been done on a quarterly basis for the first three quarters of FY2015-16. Beginning with last quarter of FY2015-16, departmental charges will be done monthly.
A-87 revenue will be 21k in FY2016-17 vs 24.6k in current year. Current plans are to eliminate use of A-87 revenue for Communications, beginning in FY2017-18. 
With the advent of tree mortality throughout the Sierra foothills including Calaveras County, it is necessary to develop a budget to help address what is anticipated to be a long term catastrophic event and ongoing Local State of Emergency. The Board of Supervisors declared a Local State of Emergency due to pervasive tree mortality on November 17, 2015. The state of emergency continues to be readopted every two to three weeks and therefore remains in effect.
On May 19, 2016, a Tree Mortality Project - California Disaster Assistance Act (CDAA) application was submitted to Cal OES and if approved, CDAA funds will cover 75% of all eligible costs incurred in addressing tree mortality throughout the County. In order for these funds to be approved however, the County must provide Cal OES with tree mortality data including estimated percent of tree mortality within the County along with the cost of tree removal. In order to develop this data, it will take two Road Maintenance Worker II positions approximately one month to survey and count trees in high mortality areas after reviewing United States Forest Service, Cal FIRE and our own GIS maps. This data will be used to build a statistical model to identify the percentage of tree mortality within the County along with estimated cost of tree removal. The cost for the two positions for one month is $8,130.79. In addition, there is the need for a project manager (Senior Engineer) to help oversee the tree mortality project. We have budgeted 960 hours for a full year for this position at a cost of $39,606.53.
Additional fiscal assistance may also come in the form of a presidential declaration which would reduce the County’s share of eligible cost to 6.25%. Supervisors Wright and Oliveira are part of the Statewide Tree Mortality Task Force that is assisting in spearheading this effort.

BUDGET MEMORANDUM
FISCAL YEAR 2016-17 Org Key 10100030 - Auditor-Controller Requested GF Contribution: $388,774
The Auditor-Controller budget includes 8 staff including:
1 - Auditor-Controller - Chief Accounting Officer 1- Assistant Auditor-Controller - General Supervision 1- Accountant Auditor I - Property Tax Manager 1 - Accountant Auditor I - Payroll Manager 1 - Accountant Auditor I- General Ledger Manager, Capital Asset Management 1- Account Tech III - Accounts Payable
1- Account Tech IV - County Credit Card, Trial Court Reporting, Property Leases, Sales Tax Management, Travel Accounts
1- Account Tech II- Special District processing and County Receipt/ Deposit Management • Note: This budget also includes $4,800 for a retirement stipend for the former Auditor- Controller that will continue to be paid until 2021.
Storage cleanup - $7,040 is spent annually for storage for my office. I will be using extra hire to help assist staff to go through the storage units and get our retention down to what is required. I am hopeful, that with this, I might be able to downsize the storage needs and costs for future years. Due to the Butte Fire, I was unable to get this done in the 2015-16 Fiscal Year.
OneSolution financial software upgrade. I will be using extra hire and overtime for existing staff to dedicate resources for a much needed upgrade of our financial software. I am hopeful that we will be able to tackle timecards, automated purchasing system, and contract management system. Again, due to ACA requirements and the Butte Fire, this project was sidelined this fiscal year. 
Rebecca Callen Auditor-Controller (209) 754-6343
The County Contribution budget unit is established to collect Trial Court revenue and centralize General Fund operating transfers to internal departments and disbursements to outside entities, such as the Calaveras Visitors Bureau and the State Controller’s Office for Trial Court MOE payment.
This budget is requiring $269,429 less in General Fund contribution than requested in 2015-16 final budget due the elimination of County Fire dispatch transfers as a donation of services to the County by CalFire.
As part of final budget, it should be discussed whether the contribution to IFISS be suspended until the fund balance that has been accumulating over the last 3 years is used. At this point, the General Fund has been over contributing funds. 
The County Side Fund is a debt service fund that collects and pays for the portion of CalPERS benefits that funds the 3% at 50 formula for “classic” members of CalPERS for the Safety classified personnel.
Payments for 2016-17 are $594,492. This is collected through payroll deductions throughout the year from departments who have classic safety members.
The term of the loan is 5 years with the final payment to occur on 6/30/2018. If there are reductions in staffing OR “classic” CalPERS members are replaced with “new” employees who fall under the pension reform formulas, the rates needed to pay this balance off will increase and at that point, there will be added costs to the General Fund in order to make up that rate change in order to have adequate collections to make the debt service payments
However, even with this potential of added cost in the future, the move to refinance this loan saves the county money overall. 
The General Obligation Bond debt is calculated and paid annually through property assessments. The final payment will be August 1, 2038. Any unspent Measure J funds can be used to pay down the debt service and mitigate the obligation from the tax payer. The current balance in the Measure J Redemption fund is $220,195.
The total payments to be made in 2016-17 are $1,759,125. Accordingly, that should be the same amount collected in bond assessments. However, any excess collections will again go toward the future debt service payments, including paying off early, if possible. 
The 2016-17 budget development has presented a number of challenges. Again, we’ve been asked to submit a status quo budget. A status quo budget works when the status quo is sufficient. That has not been the case for several years. Since the beginning of the budget cuts we’ve attempted to find innovative ways to get work done with fewer resources. We simply cannot continue down that path. This budget does not meet the goal of status quo.
The Assessor’s Office has 13 budgeted positions. They include three managers, five appraisers, one mapper, and four technicians. Our focus on training helps us stay ahead of the curve and avoid most problems despite being understaffed. Because we have cut so many positions, shortcuts have been taken that cannot be sustained. The aftermath of the Butte Fire has exposed deficiencies that must be corrected.
One deficiency is that we are not fully utilizing our property tax software. There have been enhancements to the software that would help us work more efficiently. In one instance, we tried a cheaper alternative only to find that there is a reason why it is cheaper. This year we are asking for approval to purchase an enhancement that will help our staff and local business owners with Business Property Statement filing. We are also asking for approval to purchase an enhancement that will help with Assessment Appeals.
Over the past eight years we have been developing internal systems that help the staff process more work more efficiently. It was our way of ‘doing more with less.’ The problem that we face is that those systems rely on one person when updating is needed. That person is the Assessor and her attention must be given to other pressing needs. During the Butte Fire recovery efforts, we were able to bring someone on board with the skill set to update and improve those systems. We need to keep that support on staff and respectfully request the addition of a part-time f.4 FTE] Appraiser Analyst. 'Phis position also allows the flexibility to shift assignments and complete appraisals, as needed.
Another problem that we discovered is the direct result of steps taken years ago to meet earlier budget cuts. We decided that we would stop sending requests to property owners for information that will help us assess their property. The positive impact on the budget has had a negative impact on the assessment
The last major increase to our budget falls under the category of Maintenance of Computer Software. During meetings with the Auditor-Controller, Treasurer-Tax Collector, and Chief Information Officer we determined that the costs associated with the Megabyte Property Tax System should be paid out of one of our departments. We also agreed on some additions that will provide better service for the public and increased efficiency for all departments. Those costs are now included in the Assessor’s budget. The costs have always been a General Fund charge. 'Phis change simply moves the costs from IT to the Assessor.
In March, I brought the Board up-to-date with the many challenges that we are facing with the Butte Fire Recovery efforts. There is no doubt that we will not be able to complete the 2016 assessment roll on time and the State Board of Equalization has already approved my request for an extension of time to complete the assessment roll. Roll Corrections for the Fire have taken months to complete and are not finished as this budget is being submitted. For several years we have ‘closed’ the assessment roll despite the fact that the work was not done due to reduced staffing. That practice required roll corrections to complete the prior year’s work before the current year’s work could be started. Without staffing increases that practice will continue. And, it will be worse in the coming years. Roll Corrections are time consuming. Staff turnover means that we will be operating with trainees at a time when experience is critical. Additionally, the impact of the Butte Fire cannot be understated. My staffs attention to those properties, which took more time than ‘normal’ work, means that there will be more roll corrections needed for work that we didn’t complete this year. It’s like a snow ball rolling downhill that will feel like an avalanche in a few years.
My staff operates with a high degree of professionalism and dedication to public service. It is a privilege to work with each and every one. They continue to need support that can only be provided by new staff. Nonetheless, it is obvious that the county’s financial position is not stable enough to add staff. So, I am asking that we be put at the top of the list for new positions when finances improve. And, I would also like to ask that the county consider equity adjustments for all positions in my office. Currently, promotions result in placement on the salary schedule with no opportunity for growth because of compaction in the salary grades. And the salary grades need to be more equitable across the board. It’s time for Calaveras County to start planning for the future.
Although I am not making a budget request at this time, vehicles have become a major problem. As a result of budget cuts we stopped purchasing vehicles. When vehicles became inoperable, we did not replace them. The end result is that we only have two vehicles in our fleet and they are more than ten years old. We are unable to access all properties since neither has four-wheel drive. We sincerely appreciate the help other departments provided by loaning vehicles for the Butte Fire calamity inspections. Now we need to replenish our vehicle inventory to ensure staff safety as well as ensuring that all properties are inspected.
This budget submission is a small step toward ensuring the stability of the assessment roll, the assessment staff, and the assessment process. I respectfully ask that you help us help you and approve this budget as submitted with direction to study salary equity and staffing levels. 
I have prepared the Treasurer-Tax Collectors budget as instructed; status quo based on prior year General Fund contribution.
Overview of 2016-17 Department Recommended Budget - General Fund Contribution: SI 12.017
This last November I lost 3 out of 5 employees; One to retirement, one to the Amador Tax Collector, and the third one left the state entirely. The loss of that many employees at one time, plus the calls and paperwork for the Butte Fire victims, compounded with limited personnel since the Recession, has hurt my department tremendously. I have not been able to staff my department at the level needed to assist the public in the recent months, but it is critical going forward that I maintain full staffing for the integrity of the department. The General Fund contribution plus Designated Funds will cover any salary and benefit deficit this year.
I currently have an Extra Hire on staff to assist in training on the Delinquent Secured Tax Sale desk. I would like to keep her on standby as needed for training through-out 2016-2017. The cost is minimal ($2,700) considering what the cost of a specialist would be. Although I am still minus my Chief Deputy (Assistant) and do anticipate that position to be filled sometime in August or September. That would bring the total employee count to 5 - including me.
A-87 costs are up for 16-17 this year which add 32,000 more revenue than last year.
Business licenses and Transient Occupancy Tax continue to be handled by my department. One employee spends 22% of their time processing, collecting, and report both Business Licenses and TOT; however, I receive no revenue for this. 
 
Administration directed departments to prepare a status quo budget, where the General Fund contribution remains at the same level as in the FY 2015/16 Adopted Budget. The County Counsel's 2016/17 proposed budget has attempted to meet this directive. Overall, the proposed 2016/17 budget reduces the total expenses of the office by nearly fourteen thousand dollars ($14,000); however, the total revenue has been significantly impacted from the loss of A-87 General and Non-General Fund Contributions, with a shortfall of $74,137. If the shortfall in A-87 funds is considered, our 2016/17 proposed budget is operating in a positive state.
STAFFING
The majority of County Counsel's General Fund contribution and expenses is for Budgeted Employee Costs (BEC). At the present time, the Deputy County Counsel I/II position is vacant. I have discussed with the CAO and Human Resources the need for filling the position with a more seasoned attorney who can immediately fill the position and not require extensive training. Having this position filled at a Deputy II level, my office will be able to provide services that we would not otherwise have the staffing level or expertise to do, further reducing costs incurred by the County in seeking assistance from outside counsel. 1 have included adequate funding for a Deputy II to help facilitate this change in the department.
OTHER EXPENSES: Services and Supplies
Budget line item #5221 was increased to account for the rise in membership dues for the CSAC Litigation Program; and line item #5186 also increased because the cost of software increased through Lexis-Nexis. I am also proposing an increase to line item #5272, our office's contingency fund, to meet expected and unexpected needs for litigation, general plan review, and other potential legal issues of the County. This line item was radically reduced in previous years to meet the budgetary limitations and constraints. The minimal increase would only begin to build the line item back, which will be needed since the general plan will need more attention from our office in FY 16/17. Also, at the request of the Auditor, the total amount budgeted in line item #5422-training in 2015/16 was divided into 3 separate line items in 2016/17 (#5422-training, 5477-mileage reimbursement, and 5478-travel expenses).
Budget line item #5271 and #5273, were reduced, so the overall total cost of services and supplies would meet the budgetary objectives. Our office was able to do this because the funds allocated in those line items in 2015/16 have been encumbered under existing contracts.
2016/17 Budget Memo County Counsel Page 2
REVENUE
As indicated above, the total revenue our office received through A-487 combined funds decreased from $228,989 in FY 2015/16 to $154,792 in FY 2015/16, causing a shortfall of $74,137. This is a 33% decrease. It is believed that our decrease was due to a prior attorney using her accumulated vacation and sick time in order to reduce the financial impact of her leaving. This in turn created an extended period of time where she was not generating any A-87 billable time. This office then operated for an extended period of time with only three attorneys who can generate A-87 billable time; our fourth attorney is the designated CPS attorney, who does not have billable A-87 hours.
This office is anticipating a continued decrease in our A-87 Fund contributions due to counsel being out on leave and the current Deputy Counsel I position remaining vacant for a period of time and is once again vacant. However, when the office is able to hire and retain a Deputy Counsel II, we anticipate the A-87 contributions will rise to be more consistent with the contributions received in 2015/16.
Overall, as indicated above, if the shortfall in A-87 contributions is considered and covered, our proposed 2016/17 budget is in a positive position by nearly four thousand dollars ($4,000). 
The Law Library’s case flow is derived from court filing fees of the Calaveras Superior Court. As of January 1, 2006, court filing fees (all California Superior Courts) are transferred to the Administrative Office of the Courts, who disburses the funds back to the various County funds, including the Law Library designated fund.
Over the past several years, the Law Library has experienced increases to its expenditures each year while there has been a decrease in revenues from the AOC as a result of reduced court case filings. Publishers have over the years replaced hard copy publications with electronic versions such that the costs of the printed publications have actually increased by 61% within the past four years, while revenues continue to decline (40% loss of revenue over the last four years). The Law Library has canceled subscriptions in an attempt to stay within a sustainable budget.
The Trustees’ current long-range solution involves converting most hard cover publications to the less expensive electronic on-line versions, but that in itself will take extensive funding to purchase the computers and database connections and to pay for monthly charges for the on-line version of publications. This long-range solution lean only be implemented upon the Library’s move to ADA compliant space having proper electrical connections.
 
Administration directed departments to prepare a status quo budget where the General Fund contribution remains at the same level as in the FY 2015/16 Budget In order to meet this directive, the following reductions/adjustments will need to be made within the Public Defenders 2016/17 budget
The budget and contracts for the Public Defender/Conflict Public Defender has historically been overseen by the office of County Counsel. County Counsel has long recommended that it be moved to an alternative department due to a perceived conflict as the office of County Counsel is opposing counsel to the Public Defender/Conflict Public Defender in dependency, conservatorship, and other various civil cases. County Counsel has worked with County Administration and both departments agreed to transition the administration of the Public Defender/Conflict Public Defender contract and budget to the Administration Department at the beginning of FY15/16, However, as of today's date the transition has yet to be completed.
PUBLIC DEFENDER
Public Defender services are currently provided by the Richard A. Ciummo & Associates law firm (''Ciummo"). A new three-year agreement was entered into starting in July 1, 2015 through June 30, 2018. The proposed budget for Ciummo includes a 4.0% increase ($14,789) from $369,777 to $387,566. According to the County's contract with Ciummo, a minimum of $20,000 must be earmarked each year within the Public Defendeds investigative services line item (within #5314) for Ciummo's use. The additional funds left in this account at the end of each fiscal year are rolled over to the next year and will account toward that year's $20,000 total.
CONFLICT PUBLIC DEFENDER
When Ciummo has a conflict and cannot represent a party, the Court will appoint a Conflict Public Defender. A new two-year agreement was entered into on October 1, 2015 and will expire June 30, 2017. The current contract allows for a month-to-month extension, with no fee increase, and can be cancelled by either party once a new contract is confirmed. The current contract is for $66,000.00 (#5272), which is an increase of $300.00 from the approved 2015/16 budget
Budget Memo-Public Defender April 1,2016
GENERAL FUND CONTRIBUTION INCREASE
This office requested and received an additional draw on contingency funds in the sum of $50,000.00 for the 2015/16 Budget to cover on going costs of a Capital Murder case. Even though the matter has now been resolved, there remains approximately $7,700 dollars in line item 5289. There is one' bill left to be paid for this matter in the sum of $125.00. The bill has not yet been paid as counsel has not provided a required Court Order.
REDUCTIONS
In order to meet the recommended 2016/17 General Fund contribution of $561,934, a reduction of $15,089 is needed.
I propose keeping the $50,000 in line item #5289 and taking the balance needed to cover the salary increase from this line item, thus reducing it down to $35,875. This item (#5289) was specifically set up for the Capital Murder case. County Counsel is concerned that there are now at least five (5) active murder cases pending within the County. Some bills have already been submitted for these murder cases and more are anticipated. Funding #5289 will allow our office the funding source to cover these anticipated costs. If this line item is reduced to zero then the needed monies to cover the salary increases will need to come from other line items that have already significantly been reduced from previous years.
CONCLUSION
County Counsel advises that all public defender expenses are based on Court order and must be paid. Therefore, it is impossible to accurately predict total annual expenses for this budget as recent history indicates it is heavily dependent on the number and type of criminal cases filed by the District Attorney. In particular, the number of alleged murders prosecuted during the fiscal year has a significant impact on the budget, as those types of cases routinely generate significant court-ordered defense costs. For instance, die last Capital Murder case cost the county approximately $114,400 in defense costs.

REVENUE
Effective December 31, 2015 the Department of State did not to renew our passport certification due to low volume. This resulted in a loss in revenue for the remainder of the 2015-16 fiscal year and will continue into 2016-17.
EXPENDITURES
Services and Supplies expenditures have decreased by 14% compared to the fiscal year 2015-16 final budget. Salaries and Benefits increased by 2.5% compared to fiscal year 201.5- 16 final budget.
NOTE: The department intends to present an updated fee schedule to the Board of Supervisors for approval within the next fiscal year.
GENERAL FUND IMPACT
As presented, this budget represents a 7% shortfall. The County Clerk’s budget will not meet the status quo direction given by the Board of Supervisors. The savings realized in the Recorder’s recommended budget will cover the shortfall.

COUNTY CLERK - RECORDER
Total General Fund Contribution: $359,254
EXPENSES
The implementation of a new recording system reduced our annual maintenance expense. Further saving will be realized once the system is fully functioning. Additional future savings will also be realized as we have contracted to transfer the contents of our storage to a more secure, accessible and less costly facility. By offering access to land records in an electronic format rather than film our microfilm expenses have also been reduced.
Annual salaries/services and supplies expenses were reduced by 2.5%
NOTE: The Recorder’s Department is in the process of implementing a new Recording system. The Board approved $475,000 for the project to be paid with funds from designated funds specifically intended for modernization of the recording system. The funds designated for the project that are not expended by June 30, 2016 will be encumbered into the next fiscal year.
GENERAL FUND IMPACT
As presented this budget represents a 3% overall increase to the general fund contribution (torn the 2015-16 Final Budget, meeting the status quo direction given by the Board of Supervisors.
The County Clerk's budget will not meet a status quo direction; however, the savings realized in the Recorder’s budget will cover the shortfall.
REVENUE
It is projected that actual revenue for property transfer tax (4073) for fiscal year 2015-16 will exceed the final budget projection. Based off of this projection revenue for property transfer taxes in 2016-17 was increased by 7% from final budget last year. It was not increased further because it is not anticipated to continue at the same pace thought the next fiscal year.
Revenue for recording fees (4646) is projected to decrease by 2% from fiscal year 2015-16; however, it is anticipated that an increase in document transfer tax will offset this decrease.
Overall, revenue for current fiscal year 2015-16 is on track. The recommended budget as presented for fiscal year 2016-17 projects an overall increase of revenues by 2%.
We are thankful that in spite of the challenges brought by the Butte fire, the county is able to give us the opportunity to submit a status quo budget. We have done that.
Although the status quo budget limits our Special Department Expense line (5411) and keeps our staff at current numbers, we are thankful that the county Friends of the Library have agreed to help us in two ways. First, they are asking that we establish a designated Special Department Expense - Special Purpose line (5413) into which they will deposit donations which are given to them for purchase of materials. These monies come from special donations, book sales, service organizations which wish to make donations, such as Rotary and Moose clubs, and the annual Trivia Bee. This enables us to add to our budgeted amount of $350.00 from the county, which enables us to buy local newspapers, making it possible for us to purchase materials and subscriptions in an intentional manner and build our collection strategically. They will establish this designated account with a starting balance of $7250.00. This is not shown in our budget because the designated account is not yet set up.
Secondly, the Friends of the Library are giving us the money to employ part-time staff in each of the branches, enabling us to serve each community for more than the 18 hours which the county contributes. Although we will be adding only 5 additional hours on average, this addition allows us to serve our communities better. The main library will benefit from this gift, as well. We will be able to expand our hours to offer at least one evening and limited hours on Saturdays with this extra help. The cost for these extra hours are indicated in Salaries and Benefits, but cost is offset by Miscellaneous Revenue, for which the Friends of the Library will be billed by Administration.
We are happy that this budget reflects our membership and participation in 49-99, the library cooperative which serves this area. We join Tuolomne, Amador, Lodi, Stockton and Stanislaus library systems to work together, share resources and present proposals to the State of California more effectively as we speak with one voice. We are proposing that we be the test cooperative for Link +, an interlibrary loan service that will give our patrons access to 70 library systems, including special libraries, university libraries as well as many county systems. Our status quo budget makes that participation possible.
We have been assigned a van for book delivery and funds to hire a driver one day a week are reflected in this budget. This van will enable us to expand our services to currently unreached areas, as we custom fit it as a bookmobile. These areas can be serviced by our driver on his weekly deliveries to our branches by adding some short diversions to his route. Exploration of this possibility is being done by the Library Commission.
As we build our team, we are pleased that adequate money has been provided for staff meetings, which requires travel for all branch assistants to the meeting place. We are meeting in the various branches, so each assistant will become acquainted with each branch and we can share best practices from each location. The additional travel money will also provide for my travel to 49-99 meetings and events.
The Library Department is excited to begin a new year, explore ways to meet the needs of our diverse community and offer services which will enable our patrons to find and use the information they need to live full and productive lives in Calaveras County.
Thank you for your part in helping us to make this happen. 
I reviewed the budget information for Calaveras Adult Literacy, and I wish to provide an update of the proposed budget for FY 16/17. The California State Library Literacy Service provides a significant funding source through grant funding. A base amount is initially awarded with a follow-up of second installment. The funding is combination of Intergovernmental Revenue (California) and Miscellaneous Revenue (gifts, donation, and refund). The following information is provided:
State Grants (4455) in the estimated amount of $18,000
State Grants other (4456) in the estimated amount of $13,135
Gifts/Donation (4707) and (4708) in the estimated amount of $3,800
Other financing sources such as County Reimbursement (4751) and Operating transfers in ((4721) are unknown
The services and supplies proposed expenditures are expected to be approximately $34,500.
The salary and employee benefits one full-time staff is estimated $71,000.
Although the status quo budget limits keeps our staff at current number of one, we are hopeful to secure clerical support for the abundance of clerical and support services required (18 hours). The required part-time support will enable the Literacy Coordinator to address the critical elements of outreach, networking, teaching, and coordination of literacy activities outside the Calaveras County Library. I project the required Calaveras County literacy services will expand and service the need of the Calaveras County citizens to include English as a Second Language (ESL). The Personal Mileage Reimbursement (5477) will be expanded to accommodate this projection.
In order to effective expand upon the existing literacy services, greater outreach and networking is required to secure and expand a tutorial pool. Secondly, the identification and recruitment of adult learners is critical in the expansion of literacy services.
The Calaveras Literacy Program looks forward to providing the needed service. It is critically important that we offer our services to the community and offer improved literacy services. Thank you for your help in making this a reality. 
The District Attorney is responsible for the litigation of all matters that come under the jurisdiction of the DA including all criminal cases, juvenile crime cases, and certain related civil and appellate matters. The DA’s Office includes attorneys, victim advocates, an investigations unit, and support staff. With the goal of protecting the public by prosecuting and preventing crime, the DA’s Office works closely with all local law enforcement agencies and with many other partner agencies including Probation, Health & Human Services Agency, Calaveras Crisis Center, and the Office of Education to name a few.
The DA’s Office is a GF department, with approximately 30% of its total operational costs now funded by outside sources. Dept. 30’s FY16/17 preliminary budget has been prepared with a GF contribution of $1,395,456. This exceeds the status quo target by $28,844 in order to carry out the restructuring plan initiated in FY15/16 with the assistance and support of the CAO. Pursuant to this plan, the non-sworn investigator position was eliminated at the beginning of FY 15/16. The next step in the plan and the retirement of the current Investigator II has been delayed due to difficulties in recruiting sworn investigators. The DA is continuing to work closely with the CAO and HR on this issue.
The GF contribution was reached by a $3000 reduction to Services & Supplies and by working in partnership with other agencies to share resources. Dept. 30 is receiving $12,920 from the Health & Human Services Agency for investigative support and for staffing Drug Court.

The District Attorney is requesting an Extra-Hire DDAI to cover the juvenile crime caseload and to assist with the general misdemeanor caseload. Without this position, the DA’s current staffing level will be reduced by 60% of an attorney at a time when the homicide caseload has more than doubled.
The Butte Fire disaster had a very unique impact on the DA’s Office. One of our DDA IIs also serves as the Fire Chief for Central Fire and the Butte Fire required a reduction in that employee’s time at the DA’s Office by 40%. The DA agreed to this temporary reduction based on the greater importance to the County. Salary savings from this reduction supported an Extra- Hire DDA I, netting an increase of 60% of an attorney. This additional attorney resource allowed us to shift assignments to accommodate the DDA II’s absence. More significantly, the position was able to help cover the misdemeanor and juvenile crime caseload just as the homicide caseload drastically increased.
The return of the DDA II at the beginning of FY16/17 is timely for the increased homicide caseload and the higher level of skill required. However, the demands of the misdemeanor caseload have not proportionally reduced as the homicide caseload has increased. Continuing the Extra-Hire DDA I position into FY16/17 will permit senior prosecutors to handle the increase in homicides, two of which are now set for jury trial in early FY16/17, without negatively impacting the misdemeanor and juvenile caseloads.
As with many positions Countywide, the DA’s Administrative Assistant II has taken on more and more duties over the years. The flattening of this position due to budget cuts has resulted in the Administrative Assistant II being responsible for many tasks that do not require the advanced skill level of this position. The District Attorney is requesting a .75 FTE Office Tech II in order to correct this over-burdensome and inefficient application of resources.
At mid-year FY15/16, the Administrative Assistant II began implementing a new case management system that will permit CCP data mining. To accommodate the implementation, an Extra-Hire Office Tech II was brought on to perform the Administrative Assistant II’s duties where appropriate, such as assisting with budget preparation and paying bills. The case management system implementation is on-going and will continue into FY16/17.
The broad job description of the Office Tech II provides the DA’s Office with flexibility to support those functions of office administration that can be done at a lower rate of pay than an Administrative Assistant II position. Alleviating the Administrative Assistant II of tasks that can be performed by an Office Tech II, will permit the Administrative Assistant II to focus on higher level duties and build in succession planning for certain essential functions of general office administration.
$35.000 for Investigator Vehicle
Currently, the District Attorney’s Office has two unmarked SUV’s for investigator use, a military surplus diesel truck, and a 2001 Ford Taurus sedan for staff use. With the moves of the Court and the Sheriffs Office, DA staff frequently must drive to accomplish their work, although many staff members do try to walk whenever possible. When driving is required due to weather or time or physical caseload, most staff chose to use their personal vehicles because of the Taurus’ unreliability and a yellow jacket infestation problem that cannot seem to be resolved.
In evaluating the safety, usefulness, an intended purpose of the all the vehicles, staff recommends converting one of the unmarked SUVs to a staff vehicle and acquiring a new unmarked vehicle for investigator use. With equipment from the converted SUV, we estimate the cost of a new investigator vehicle to be approximately $35,000.
POTENTIAL BUDGET ISSUES:
MMRSA Prosecution Unit
On its face, the proposed MMRSA County Ordinance will impact the DA’s Office as the Ordinance declares violations to be misdemeanors. This is a new class of crimes created to accommodate a new law and regulate a new commercial industry within the County. As such, this is a new burden placed on the DA’s Office. Should the other County Agencies declared responsible for enforcing the Ordinance have the capacity to do so, the District Attorney will be requesting funding for a vertical “MMRSA Prosecution Unit” comprised of a DDAII, a Legal Clerical, an Investigator specializing in forensic accounting, and sufficient services and supplies to support the Unit.
The “MMRSA Prosecution Unit” would handle technical violations of the Ordinance, Unfair Business Practices cases, and crimes that will occur due to the nature of marijuana itself. These crimes will include, but are not limited to, organized crime, medical marijuana diversion, possession/sales at schools, marijuana “rips”, and other crimes currently occurring but unreported by marijuana suppliers. Depending on volume, MMRSA related environmental crimes may be handled by the CDAA Environmental Circuit Prosecutor. The DA will request approval and funding for the “MMRSA Prosecution Unit” with the formal passage of the Ordinance. This request may be advanced depending on the language of the Urgency Ordinance being considered on April 12,2016.
Underfunded Litigation Budget
While the overwhelming majority of criminal cases are resolved by plea or trial without expending resources for experts or other special litigation costs, certain cases do require these resources in order to pursue justice. The DA only approves special litigation expenses upon compelling justification by the DDA handling the case. We currently have numerous complex and high profile cases that may require special litigation resources in FY16/17. Should the litigation budget drop below an amount that protects the DA’s Constitutional authority to decide which matters to pursue, the DA will be requesting the litigation budget be replenished. 
Funding will be acquired through the following sources (indicate if General Fund, State reimbursement, fees, etc., and the percentage breakdown):
This position is necessary due to a significant increase in departmental workload?
If yes, describe how/why workload has increased and give pertinent statistics, such as percentage increase in workload.
Significant changes to the law since 2008 have contributed to a shifting and increasing workload for the DA’s Office. For instance, in 2008, Prop 9 “Marsy’s Law” was passed granting Constitutional rights to victims of crime and requiring the DA’s Office to, among other things, notify victims of their rights and work much closer with the victim if they choose to exercise their rights. The Criminal Justice Realignment Act of 2011, the biggest change in the criminal justice system in decades, continues to impact caseloads. Then, on the heels of AB109, came 3 JP orders to reduce the prison population, and Prop 47.
Significant changes over the years made by entities outside the DA’s office have also contributed to an increase in workload within the DA’s Office. For instance, changes in the court location, protocols, and case management system have increased work for DA staff. The Sheriffs Office change to the RIMS reporting system continues to have a significant impact on the work load of the DA’s Office in terms of discovery issues.
Finally, the DA’s Office has experienced an increase in homicide and other complex/high profile cases over the last 3 years. These cases are very labor intensive and impact the workload of everyone in the office, even those who may not be assigned directly to a particular case.
With the overall picture of increased work load over the last few years, Deputy DA’s, Paralegals, and the Administrative Assistant have had to take on many additional tasks resulting in an inefficient use of resources in certain areas. An Office Technician position would fill the gap between the Clerical Assistant and the higher level positions of the Paralegals and Administrative Assistant resulting in a much more efficient use of resources.
This position will provide support staff work for (include programs, departmental responsibilities or departmental personnel):
This position will provide additional work for support staff in terms of time-keeping and payroll. Significantly, however, this position will also provide valuable relief for existing support staff in time-keeping and payroll. In addition, this position will alleviate support staff work in other
areas such as the preparation of routine legal documents and assisting with Departmental and inter-agency projects.
This request is being made due to a State mandate or audit exception. describe mandate, etc.
Failure to establish/add this position will adversely impact the department in the following manner:
The department will continue to struggle with using its personnel resources efficiently, will continue to struggle supporting and/or adjusting to changes made by external entities, and will be continue to be limited in providing prompt services to victims, witnesses, and the public at large. Shifting appropriate tasks to an Office Technician would permit the Paralegals and Administrative Assistant to support the Deputy DAs and the DA in a more cost efficient manner and permit the Clerical Assistant to focus on performing routine clerical functions.
The position being requested is an established County classification and salary range.
Additional comments:
None.
Physically, where will this position be assigned? Is there existing space and equipment (desk, vehicle, computer, etc.) or will this position generate the need for additional space and equipment? Please explain:
The position would be assigned to the DA's Office. The DA’s main trailer has sufficient space and

PROGRAM SUMMARY
A violent crime can impact many aspects of a person’s life. Not only does crime affect the victim but also their loved ones and sometimes, an entire community. A crime can have long lasting physical, emotional and financial effects.
Often the needs of crime victims can appear to be overshadowed by the focus on the investigation and prosecution of the accused. The Calaveras County District Attorney’s Office Victim-Witness Program seeks to make the criminal justice system more understandable, accessible and responsive to the concern of victims and witnesses.

Department 800, Reduce Impaired Driving (RID) is composed entirely of grant funds received from the Office of Traffic Safety and has no impact on the GF.
•	$43,067 - Grant funds:
This grant provides funding on the federal fiscal year cycle from October 1st through September 30lh annually. Dept. 800 can only be budgeted for the first quarter of the County fiscal year pending receipt of the grant renewal funding letter for the remainder of the County fiscal year. This budget funds 1 FTE Deputy District Attorney II, a .2 FTE Paralegal, and services and supplies including mandatory training for the first quarter.
PROGRAM SUMMAR Y:
The RID team has three essential goals:
• Vertical Prosecution of all DUI Cases
Vertical prosecution means that a single Deputy DA is assigned to prosecute the case from the initial charging through adjudication. With a dedicated team assigned to all DUI cases, case preparation and readiness, prosecutorial expertise, agency coordination, and consistency in Court proceedings are all improved. The criminal
justice system can be complicated and confusing to victims of DUIs. The RID team helps victims and their families navigate the justice system by providing information and referrals and keeping them informed about the process of the case. Communication and trust between the prosecution and victims are part of the foundation for a successful prosecution.
Prevention and Reducing Recidivism
Prevention and reducing recidivism are an integral part of RID’s mission. With that in mind, the RID team worked closely with Probation, local law enforcement, Behavioral Health/Substance Abuse, the Coroner, and many other community partners, and created the Reduce Impaired Driving & Education program (RID&E). RID&E began as an innovative voluntary early intervention program for juveniles at risk of alcohol and/or drug abuse. Participating juveniles attended a series of interactive multi-disciplinary presentations designed to raise their awareness, challenge their perceptions, and help them develop tools to make better choices for their future. RID&E sessions have included powerful presentations by DUI victims, recovering addicts, and DUI defendants heading to prison. Parents/guardians of the juveniles are required to attend the final RID&E session in an effort to encourage ongoing communication on the issues facing their children. RID&E was so well received, it has expanded to include a separate Court ordered track. Without funding from this grant, RID&E would not be possible.
Education and Outreach
Through RID, the DA has developed a coordinated multi-disciplinary impaired driving education and outreach program targeted both youth and adults. RID has created interactive school presentations that range from the classroom to Courtroom setting to larger school assemblies and special events, depending on the school’s request. RID school presentations focus on raising student awareness to the dangers of not only alcohol impairment, but the danger of legal and illegal drug use as well. RID uses real life scenarios and methods designed to engage the students in conversation regarding the risks and responsibilities they may face. At community events, RID offers information, referrals, and the opportunity for individuals to try the “Drunk Goggles” which simulate the impairment to physical coordination caused by alcohol at different levels. The RID team has received very positive feedback on its education and outreach.

Status Quo versus (BEC) Budget Reduction
The attached budget has been compiled using the instructions received from the County Administrative Office for a Budget requesting a “Status Quo Budget.” As you read through this memo and the other memos relating to our other budget units, it is my hope that this information will be at the forefront of your thoughts and considerations. The Sheriffs Office and CAO Shirley Ryan have come to a tentative agreement pending the Board’s approval to offset reductions triggered by the Status Quo Budget that are largely due to Budgeted Employee Cost (BEC) increases negotiated through the county’s system. Although the County Administrative Office requested the “Status Quo Budget”, as your “Acting Sheriff” I believe it is very important that we submit a budget that outlines a path for safety for our community and for our employees.
The impacts of violent crimes associated with marijuana cultivation and other reports of crime and calls for service relating to marijuana cultivation have created a significant impact on our organization. The reports of illegal marijuana cultivation and complaints coupled with the Butte Fire will continue to impact our workload, budget and staffing challenges in the coming fiscal year. We also could not help but notice the Coroner’s mid-year budget increase request. The Coroner’s request is stemming from an increase in workload and associated costs with persons who have deceased. It should be noted that the increase in workload to the Sheriffs Office is directly tied to the Coroner’s increase as the Sheriffs Office is the first responder on the front end of the deaths of citizens in the county. The costs of hiring and lack of employee retention also continues to significantly impact our operations. The Sheriffs Office has lost several employees for a variety of reasons over the last fiscal year. The cost to recruit, hire and train new employees is being funded out of existing budget and staffing resources. The Sheriff’s Office has developed two plans to improve this reoccurring issue however; the Board of Supervisors should consider directing a cost benefit analysis and an employee survey regarding the hiring and retention of Sheriffs Office employees.
As the Board of Supervisors continues to direct the development of the General Plan through the work of Planning Department and the Planning Commission it is critical that the Sheriffs Office be included and specifically funded through the use of governmental funding tools utilized and strengthened by specific and direct inclusion into the new General Plan. The development of a planning tool to directly fund the impacts of growth on the Sheriffs Office specific to staffing and communications cannot be overlooked within this fiscal year. Many of the disagreements resulting in contention between the Board of Supervisors and previous Sheriffs have revolved around lack of Sheriffs funding which directly impacts Sheriffs Staffing, Sheriffs equipment and Sheriff Communications. By properly using the planning tools it is my hope to work together to build a long term planning mechanism to solve some of these long term and severely problematic issues.
You will note the requests for additional investigative staff within the Sheriffs Budget. This is a direct result of an increase in marijuana related crimes both violent and nonviolent and the associated calls for service and investigations. In addition you will notice a request for General Fund increases for the Office of Emergency Services. This budget has been underfunded for several years. Due to ongoing budget reductions the Sheriffs Office was forced to use grants to pay for staffing to completed work related to the Office of Emergency Services. Due to the Butte Fire this last year, the Sheriffs Office, was forced to utilize staffing, equipment and supplies far beyond what had been budgeted and supported. In addition due to the same ongoing budget reductions the Sheriffs Office was forced to use other small designated funds to pay for staffing. Some of these designated funds are used to establish funds over a period of time to replace expensive equipment that the Sheriffs Office must use to complete work required by the Sheriffs Office through statute or law. The unfortunate realization is those designated funds were depleted by paying for staffing. The funds include the DNA Fund, Sheriffs Civil Fund, Cal ID Fund other Sheriffs Office employees.
During this year’s employee recruiting efforts the Sheriffs Office noticed a strong interest in the Sheriffs Recruit Program. This is the program whereby the Sheriffs Office hires Extra-Hire Recruit Deputy Sheriffs and pays them in addition to paying for the Basic POST Police Academy. In order to plan for future vacancies the Sheriffs Office would like to place (4) Recruit Deputies into the Basic Post Academy during the FY 16/17 Budget. At the time of this document the applicant interest in the Recruit Program has been much stronger than that of any lateral Deputy Sheriff Applicants or those who have already completed Basic POST Training.
The Sheriffs Office is also requesting (2) two new marked 4x4 Patrol Vehicles. The Sheriffs Office is still trying to recover from the recession years where patrol vehicles were replaced. In addition the Sheriffs Office is requesting to use General Fund Dollars or Salary Savings from 2015/2016 to finance the replacement of emergency patrol vehicle that was involved in a collision and is no longer operational.
Below you will find an itemized list of requests relating to the Sheriff’s Operations Budget. In addition you will find supplemental Budget Memos from our other Budget Units outlining important changes and issues that are pending within each Budget Sub- Unit. 
through the Dispatch budget. The Special Operations Division was previously funded 80% General Funds in Dispatch (33) and 20% General Funds in OES (47).
Charges for Services is estimated based on the total calls received during the 2015 - 2016 Fiscal year. The county is currently in contract negotiations with American Legion Ambulance and Ebbetts Pass Fire for Emergency Medical Dispatch services. The contract has not yet been finalized. The new contract amount will be included once the contracts have been finalized.
Two communication contracts need to be financed in Dispatch in order to maintain and protect County assets.
The first is the Avtec Dispatch Communication Center Service Contract. The contract is critical for maintaing and upgrading the new Dispatch radio communications equipment located in the Dispatch Center. The cost of the contract is $9,965 per year and the performance period of the contract is five (5) years.
The second is the Alcatel-Lucent Microwave Service Contract. The contract is mission critical and is for the maintenance of communications, particularly the microwave [communication] system. The microwave system provides data service to patrol units in the field; two way dispatch and enforcement information is provided to patrol units through the Mobile Data Termination (MDT) equipment installed in the patrol units. The contract was originally funded five years ago with a one-time PSIC technology grant. An increase to appropriations from the General Fund, in the amount of $7,560 per year, is needed to finance the contract. The contract’s performance period is three (3) years.
Sheriffs Recommendation
Finance Dispatch at the base level, including the financing of budgeted employee cost increases.
Increase Services and Supplies base funding in the amount of $17,525 for the financing of Avtec and Alcatel-Lucent contracts.
Increase the Training and Travel funding due to the fact that the Sheriffs Office will be hiring new dispatchers during the 2016 - 2017 Fiscal year that will require training in addition to the training costs incurred for existing Dispatchers needing to comply with continuing education requirements.
Increase Office Supplies funding to cover expenses that have increased due to higher product costs.

Sheriff's Request
The Calaveras County Sheriffs Office is requesting an increase in general fund contribution for salaries and employee benefits at this time to balance this budget unit equal to the previous year's allocation. This is due to increased budgeted employee costs from FY2015-2016 to FY2016-2017 as well as the essential need to keep the remaining Deputy Sheriff and Sergeant positions that are assigned to the Calaveras Narcotics Enforcement Unit fully funded. The increase in marijuana related investigations and crimes, including violent crimes involved with the cultivation and trafficking of marijuana, is overwhelming current CNEU and Detective staffing levels. The amount requested will keep the same staffing level as the previous year without forcing cuts and a reduction in the narcotics unit. 
Additionally, Calaveras County is seeing unprecedented changes in regulations and culture regarding the marijuana industry. Surrounding counties have legislation in place with strict regulations regarding personal use and caregivers for medical marijuana while Calaveras County has a well-known historical lack of local regulations. Now commercial marijuana operations are being considered to be allowed in Calaveras County. There has been an exponential increase in the cultivation of marijuana within Calaveras County over the past two years without an equal increase in law enforcement staffing to handle the influx of investigations. Currently there is not a county funded investigative position within the Sheriffs Office that is dedicated exclusively for marijuana investigations. Not only is there a need for full time marijuana investigators to handle the hundreds of cases in order to determine the legality of each marijuana cultivation site, but there is also the need to investigate the increased number of violent crimes against persons, trespassing, and theft cases throughout Calaveras County that are in direct correlation to the cultivation and trafficking of marijuana. In FY2015-2016, the Board of Supervisors opted to allow for an additional narcotics officer (position 35-06) to be funded through CalEMA LLESA. Due to short staffing levels, that position remained open and unfilled in FY2015/2016. At this time, the Sheriffs Office is requesting full funding for the open 1.0 FTE Deputy Sheriff (position 35-06) through general funding in the amount of $111,285.86 for a dedicated marijuana investigator. We are also requesting a new position to be added for a second marijuana investigator in the amount of $111,285.86. Total additional general funding request for the two dedicated marijuana investigators is $222,571.72.

Marine Safety Program Revenue: Subvention Grant from the Department of Boating and Waterway
The Subvention Grant from California Department of Parks and Recreation, Division of Boating and Waterways has been allocated to the Calaveras County Sheriffs Office for over nineteen (19) consecutive years. The purpose of the Subvention Grant is to finance Marine Safety operations. The allocation amount of $174,926 has remained unchanged for the past eight (8) years. 
The California Department of Parks and Recreation, Division of Boating and Waterways mandates that the Subvention Grant funds be the last source of revenue used for financing operations. The State mandates funding sources are to be used in the following order: Unsecured Boat Taxes; General Fund; Subvention Grant.
Marine Safety Program Revenue: Unsecured Boat Taxes
Revenues derived from Unsecured Boat Taxes have been received by the Calaveras County Sheriff’s Office Marine Safety program for over thirteen (13) consecutive years. The revenue is allocated only if the Sheriffs Department maintains the unit in connection with the Department of Boating and Waterways Subvention Grant.
Unsecured Boat Tax revenue has declined by 30.78% from FY 2009-2010 to FY 2014- 2015. The Marine Safety Unit has been relatively unable to maintain equipment, vessels, and trailers and staff lake patrol functions due to the reduction in Unsecured Boat Tax revenue and cuts made to the Sheriffs Office General Fund appropriation. Patrols include Lake Tulloch, New Hogan Lake, New Melones Lake, Camanche Reservoir, and Pardee Lake. Without extra overtime only two lakes can be patrolled per day, with one deputy at each of the two lakes that are patrolled for the day.
To meet County budget appropriation targets, Marine Safety eliminated three (3) extra hire deputy sheriff positions. The loss of extra hire sheriff deputies and the imposition of restrictions to overtime significantly decreased the amount of patrols on Lake Tulloch, New Hogan Lake, New Melones Lake, Camanche Reservoir, and Pardee Lake.
Reduction in lake patrols has caused considerable risks and impacts to officer and public safety.
Equipment maintenance has improved the availability of marine vessel and trailers for use by sworn staff and the availability of dive equipment for use by the Rescue Dive Team. Due to limited staffing resources in Marine Safety, the Sheriff Office’s Rescue Dive Team has been unable to maintain a consistent training regimen.
Marine Safety Program Expenditures: Budgeted Employee Cost (BEC) Increases
If the Sheriffs Office absorbed BEC increases, Marine Safety would be forced to reduce regular law enforcement coverage on Lake Tulloch, New Hogan Lake, New Melones Lake, Camanche Reservoir, and Pardee Lake. The department’s dive team will receive only partial funding, thus limiting their capabilities and availability for deployment. 
The Calaveras County Jail is primarily funded by the county general fund with the exception of funding received from the Calaveras Community Partnership (AB109) committee. Funding received for AB109 purposes will not be discussed in this memo as it is detailed under a separate memo, with a specific request for a dedicated and independent budget.
Important considerations regarding the request for the 2016/17 FY include the fact that during the 2015/16 fiscal year, the jail had several vacancies and was able to realize salary savings from these open positions. Without the salary savings, the costs to operate the Jail would have exceeded the 2015/16 FY budget at an even greater level.
It is important to note that the Jail is not adequately staffed, and has not been since its opening in June of 2014. Shifts within the Jail facility are staffed at minimum staffing, and absences caused by illness or vacation require overtime backfill. Often, staffing is not adequate to allow for inter-facility transports of prisoners, causing additional staff to be called in on overtime.
It should be noted that although the Jail has recently filled several open spots, it is anticipated that other employees will leave, and the net effect will still cause vacancies in the shift. Therefore, a reduction in overtime and extra hire funding cannot be sustained despite the current staffing levels.
For the 2016/17 Fiscal year, the following changes are requested:
Salaries and Benefits:
Notable changes within the 10100380 budget include the removal of two FTE employees due to their transfer to the dedicated AB109 Budget. Additionally, a third tenured (E/LLL) employee will also be transferred into the AB109 budget at 83% FTE and replaced with funding for a C- step employee (the remaining 17% of the tenured employee will continued to be paid from this budget). 
This memo concerns funding which is received from the Calaveras Community Partnership (CCP). The Calaveras County Sheriffs Office has entered in a memorandum of understanding with the CCP committee and will receive a total of $454,608 from AB 109 funding. Of this amount, $346,405 is directed to the Calaveras County Jail for costs associated with a work program, correctional officer staffing, and food, medical and housing costs associated with the housing of parolees and AB109 subjects. The remaining amount ($106,203) provides funding for a Deputy Sheriff who provides supervision for AB109 subjects. The Deputy Sheriff funding is discussed in the Sheriff Patrol budget memo.
It is requested that the Calaveras County Jail be issued a new and additional budget to be used only for AB109 funding. By having a dedicated budget, the tracking of appropriate expenses is less staff intensive, and no co-mingling of funds will occur.
The attached schedule 9 represents the expenses which will occur within the new AB109 budget.
Salaries and Employee Benefits: $242,405
The funds within the salary and benefits line provide for 2 Correctional Officers who are utilized within the Jail Facility to provide supervision and programs for AB109 and parolee inmates. Additionally, a third Correctional Officer is funded at 83% FTE for purposes of supervising inmates and AB109 subjects on a work detail program. The work detail program is a new program for the 2016/17 FY.
It is noted that the third correctional officer is funded at 83% FTE. The remainder of the salary to equal 100% FTE is paid from the 10100380 budget unit. The AB109 funding for the third Correctional Officer Position is intended to provide a new position within the jail and is not intended to simply replace existing staff and funding. A new position control number should be assigned and associated to the new position, although an existing staff member will be assigned to the program. This will be done due to the fact that the Correctional Officer who supervises the inmates and AB109 subjects outside of 
the jail facility on a work detail will need to have sufficient training and be legally certified to carry a firearm on duty. By the nature of correctional officer training, firearm training and the ability to work outside of the facility does not occur until an employee has worked in the Jail for at least one year.
Service and Supplies ($104,000)
The funding contained within the service and supply lines are also entirely received from AB109 funding. Notable expenses include $25,000 in minor equipment (5499) which will be received as part of the new work program. The minor equipment funding is a one-time funding (start-up costs), and will likely not reoccur after the 2016/17 FY. Other expenses include $56,500 in special department expense (5411), which will be used to offset costs associated with the housing of AB109 or parolee inmates which are not otherwise directly covered under other line items (I.E. medical costs).
Acting Sheriff Recommendation:
It is recommended that the included schedule 9 be designated as a new and independent budget within the Sheriffs Jail budget category. Additionally, it recommended that the position control numbers of 38-12,38-27, and 38-28 be placed on an independent BEC as shown in the attached document.
BEC Cost increases:
The increases in BEC costs, less the bee cost increases of employees who were removed and reinstalled in the AB109 budget unit, is $10,647. This amount is considerably lower than anticipated due to the fact that the Jail has experienced a large staff turnover, and many employees have not yet accrued longevity increases in their base salary. If the net increase in the BEC costs is not absorbed by the county general fund, it is requested that cost increase be removed from the overtime allocation. This reduction will represent a decrease in required and mandatory funding that it is unsustainable, and the overtime line will then be funded at a level which is predictably inadequate.
New Position Requests:
Two new FTE positions are requested for the 2016/17 FY. The first requested increase is to increase the Salaries and Wages Line (5001) equivalent to the FTE cost of an additional Correctional Technician ($57,693). The Technician position (38-31) was unfunded during the 2014/15 FY budget and has not been restored. As a result of the elimination of this position, the main control position in the Jail is staffed with only one person at all times. Currently, the sole operator is tasked with monitoring 48 camera views, as well as two additional touch screen ingress/egress control. Duties within the main control booth also include electronic supervision of all inmates, security screening of all persons entering the jail, and controlling all staff movement / door opening closures within the Jail. One person is not sufficient to conduct all of these duties, and the understaffing of this position is placing undo risk onto officers and inmates. The main control booth was designed to be operated by two Technicians.
The second additional requested increase is the cost of one FTE Correctional Officer (Entry Level). The cost of this position is approximately $69,557.00. This position is necessary for the daily operation of the jail in order to increase staffing levels. Currently, no funding source has been identified for this position other than a general fund contribution equivalent to the requested amount.
Extra Hire (5002): Net increase $26,393
Increase in extra hire funding (5002) from 50,472 to 76,865. This amount is projected to be the actual costs for the current fiscal year, an amount equivalent to actual costs is requested for the 2016/17 Fiscal year. Extra hire employees are used to backfill staff vacancies when vacancies occur due to illness or vacation. The use of extra hire employees is a low cost alternative to using employees on overtime.
Professional and Specialized Services (5271): Net Increase $78,753
Increase in Professional and Specialized service (5271) from 506,709 to $585,462. This increase is comprised of two significant changes as follows:
• Requested increase is $ 17,485 for the CFMG (Jail Medical Contract), which is comprised of a contractual 2.88% CPI increase which is equivalent to $13,993.38, as well as $3,492 increase due to the jail population. The current contract with CFMG is based on an average daily population within the jail of fewer than 90 inmates. The quarterly costs increase when the daily population exceeds 90 inmates. The $3,492 increase is based upon a projection of average daily population.
• New flinding for the cost of a 1 year contract with Justice Systems Corporation for services within the new Jail facility at a cost of $61,267. Justice Systems currently provides maintenance and repair services for the facility by way of an existing warranty and service agreement which will expire in April of 2016. This contract will provide scheduled 90 day preventative maintenance to the security and electronics components of the new jail facility, 12 hour emergency response for emergency equipment malfunction, immediate telephone support, offsite software redundant backup, security evaluation for unauthorized network intrusions, as well as elevator and door safety and security maintenance and operation check. It should be noted that negotiations are currently underway with Justice Systems Corporation
Psychological Services (5285): Net Increase $1,200
Increase in Psychological Service (5285) from $800.00 to $2,000. Due to employee turnover, the Calaveras County Jail is on track to spend over $2,200 for psychological screenings of prospective candidates this fiscal year. It is anticipated that an equal number of screenings will occur during the 2016/17FY.
Special Department Expense (5411): Net Increase $12,255
Increase in Special Department Expense from zero (0) to $12,255 for the implementation and annual subscription costs to Lexipol for a new Custody manual and legal support. The Calaveras County Jail currently utilizes a staff generated policy and procedure manual. The manual is reliant upon staff to ensure that it is up to date with constantly changing case law and standard procedure. This practice is cumbersome and staff intensive. Due to the fact that the Sheriffs Office does not employ an agency specific legal advisor, the current policy and procedure manual for the County Jail is quickly becoming outdated. The Lexipol Manual provides comprehensive, court-tested policies written by legal and law enforcement professionals. It contains more than 150 policies based on federal and state statutes, case law and law enforcement best practices. The Lexipol custody manual is constantly monitored by Lexipol legal staff for any required updates or changes. Currently, numerous legal issues exist which could place detention facilities at risk of suit or legal claim. The Lexipol continuous update process is in place in order to confirm that all policies and procedures are in compliance with current laws. The acquisition of the Lexipol Custody Manual is a risk management tool, and the investment will well exceed the potential liabilities created by having an inadequate and/or outdated policy and procedure manual.
Travel Expense (5478): Net Increase $21,800
Increase in travel expense (5478) from $16,500 to $38,300. Of this amount, $17,300 is requested for mandatory training costs for new and existing officers. Due to staff turnover in the jail, 5 new employees will be required to attend the six week CORE training class within their first year of employment. The attendance at the CORE class requires lodging, meals, and tuition. These same employees will also have to attend the 832 Penal Code training, which is a total of 6 days, also requiring meals, lodging, tuition, and ammunition cost. In addition to the basic training class, two additional employees will be required to attend a Correctional Supervisor school as well as a training officer school, while 16 others are required to attend a minimum of 24 hours of ongoing training.
The second request is for an additional $4,500 in travel expense costs. The costs for lodging and food for required for Officers while transporting inmates is drawn from this line. It is requested that a new budget line be added to the 2016/17 budget so that these expenses can be better tracked. The per-diem cost per transport is approximately $50.00 per transport. From July 2016 thru February 29,2016,109 transports occurred, although not all required per diem allocations. The Calaveras County Jail is on track to conduct over 180 transports during the 2015/16 FY, and is estimated that the number will be consistent for the 2016/17 FY. For the reason, the Calaveras County Jail is requesting an additional $4,500 in per diem funding for the cost of prisoner transport.
Gas and Oil Expense (5480): Net increase $1,000.
The Calaveras County Jail is equipped with an emergency backup generator which provides power to the Jail and Administration building during power outages. The 2015/16 FY budget does not contain funding for the costs of fuel for this generator. The generator is run for a minimum of 30 minutes per month, and the yearly cost for fuel is anticipated to be approximately $1,000.00. The requested amount does not include the costs to refuel the generator if an extended power outage were to occur.
Reimbursement - Services/ Supplies (5632): $79,000 cost offset.
This amount is budgeted as a direct reimbursement for costs associated with parolee/ AB109 housing and associated costs. This amount is budgeted under the new requested budget unit for AB109 funding, and will be reimbursed back to the 10100380 budget as needed. 
In 2015, the Sheriffs Office received the Anti-Drug Abuse JAG Grant in the amount of $220,000. This was year one allocation of a three year grant program. During the year two application process, Calaveras County’s grant allocation was reduced to $207,028 by the BSCC. Several changes were made from FY2015-2016 to FY20I6-2017 to account for the reduced allocation as well as increased Budgeted Employee Costs (BECs).
o Due to the reduction of $ 12,972 in overall grant allocation the following change was made. Last year, the Sheriffs Office budgeted $28,533 in overtime for special activities related to anti-drug abuse education and enforcement. That amount was reduced this year to $ 15,561. ($4,000 for DEA Take back & $ 11,561 for High-Point Drug Market Intervention Programs) o $34,722 is allocated for the DDA (the original grant application lists this amount and estimated it at .25 FTE DDA, but the set grant funded amount is slightly lower than that percentage). The DDA position will be funded at approx. 20%. o 100% FTE Deputy Sheriff = $ 111,285.97 o 22% FTE Sergeant = $34,310.49
¦ The Sergeant’s percentage paid for by this grant was reduced from last year due to projected increase BEC of the 100% FTE Deputy Sheriff.
Subject: Fiscal Year 2016-2017 Department Request for Office of Emergency Services (10100470)
The Sheriff Office’s FY 2016-2017 budget request for Office of Emergency Services (10100470) conforms to the County Administrative Officer’s Recommended Budget Development Instructions, except for the absorption of Budgeted Employee Cost (BEC) increases and the absorption of employee costs that were previously funded through Grant revenues.
Highlighted Changes in Revenue Classes
Intergovernmental Revenue - State
o FY 2015-2016 Budgeted Amount: $177,843 o FY 2016-2017 Budgeted Amount: $0
o The FY 15-16 budgeted amount included revenue from the Emergency Management Performance Grant (EMPG). EMPG funds will be budgeted out of Intergovernmental Revenue - Federal going forward and the Intergovernmental Revenue - State line item will not be used to reflect grant revenues.
Intergovernmental Revenue - Federal
o FY 2015-2016 Budgeted Amount: $ 134,352 o FY 2016-2017 Budgeted Amount: $254,949
o The difference in the budgeted amount for FY 2016 - 2017 reflects moving the Fiscal Year 2016 - 2017 EMPG revenue ($134,474) from Intergovernmental Revenue - State to this account. The budgeted amount also reflects a carryover of $120,475 from the FY 2015 Homeland Security Grant. FY 2015 Homeland Security Grant funds are associated with projects for the Authorized Group of Five “Gang of 5” which includes Public Health, Angels Camp Police Department, Angels City Fire Department, County Fire and the Sheriff’s Office. The listed agencies haven’t completed their projects and therefore, reimbursement has not been sought for the revenue. The Homeland Security Grant has a three year grant cycle. The FY 2016/2017 Homeland Security Grant award amount has not yet been announced and will be added to this account upon receipt of the award amount.
Highlighted Changes in Expense Classes
Salaries and Employee Benefits
o FY 2015-2016 Budgeted Amount: $149,176 o FY 2016-2017 Budgeted Amount: $276,921
o Includes personnel reassignments and increase to budgeted employee costs.
Services and Supplies
o FY 2015-2016 Budgeted Amount: $206,930 o FY 2016-2017 Budgeted Amount: $252,185
o Does not include Department of Homeland Security Grant. The Homeland Security Grant award has not been announced.
Budgeted Employee Cost (BEC) Increases
Office of Emergency Services has used the Emergency Management Performance grant to fund two positions since 2010. However, the Emergency Management Performance Grant historically has been used for and is better suited for use in acquiring needed equipment to improve and repair the county’s antiquated radio system infrastructure. The increase in Salaries and Employee Benefits reflects funding one full time Sheriffs Service Technician which was previously funded 50% by EMPG and 50% by the General Fund; one full time Sheriffs Sergeant Position which was also previously funded 50% by EMPG and 50% General Fund. The increase also reflects including the BEC’s for one full time Deputy Sheriff to be assigned to OES. OES staff previously included one Sergeant, One Deputy Sheriff, and one Sheriff’s Services Technician. However, due to decreased staffing for the patrol division, the Deputy Sheriff position was moved from OES (47) to Patrol (32).
Absorption of personnel cost increase would further reduce the County’s capability to prepare for, protect against, respond to, recover from, and mitigate hazards and disasters. The reduction will worsen a disaster’s impact on the community and public. The reduction will also increase the cost, to the County, of responding to and recovering from a disaster incident.
Services and Supplies Changes
5203 - Maintenance of Communications Equipment:
a. Increase reflects adding the additional amount of $96,158 from EMPG that is no longer used to fund salaries.
5393 - Rents and Leases - Spec Purp.:
a. The increase in this line item reflects an estimate of the annual lease amount for the Sierra Vista radio tower plus the lease amount for the Sheriffs Office facility at the Calaveras Airport. The final budget amount for 2015 was $37,200 which was the amount for the lease at the Sierra Vista radio tower. The 2015 final budget amount did not include the lease for the Sheriffs Office facility at the Calaveras Airport. EMPG funds are used to pay the Sierra Vista radio tower lease.
5412 - Spec Dept Exp - Spec Purp:
a. The change in this line item reflects moving FY 15 HSG funds from this Object Code to Object Code 5499. This account also previously reflected remaining FY 14 HSG funds that will be expended by the conclusion of the grant cycle in May 2016. Therefore, the balance in this object code will be $0.00.
5422 - Training:
a. The increase in this line item reflects the estimated amount required to properly train Sheriffs Office Personnel to operate and effectively manage the Emergency Operations Center during a disaster.
5478 - Travel Expense:
a. The increase in this line item reflects the estimated cost to send Sheriffs Office Personnel to OES specific training.
5499 - Minor Equipment - Other:
a. The change in this line item reflects FY 15 Homeland Security Grant (HSG) funds being transferred from Object Code 5412 to this object code in addition to FY 14 HSG funds being expended by the end of the grant cycle in May 2016. This line item does not yet include FY 16 HSG funds because the award amount has not yet been announced.
Capital Assets Change
The increase to object code 5701 reflects the correct amount for the Sheriffs Office Homeland Security Grant project. The amount has been adjusted based on an interdepartment agreement between Angels Camp Police Department and the Sheriffs Office to fund the purchase of new Low band base station radios. The Angels Camp Police Department has agreed to allow the Sheriffs Office to use a portion of their Homeland Security Grant award for this project.
Sheriffs Recommendation
Finance Office of Emergency Services at the base level, including the financing of budgeted employee cost increases.
Increase the training and travel budgets in order to have personnel properly trained to work in the EOC during disasters. The OES budget for Training and Travel Expenses was $0 and $400 respectively in FY 2015 - 2016. Properly staffing and managing the Emergency Operations Center will require OES specific training for multiple personnel within the Sheriffs Office. 
The Probation Department has been directed to prepare its budget assuming a status quo General Fund contribution of $1,055,547.00. The proposed budget reaches that target.
Below are the highlighted proposed changes for the coming year:
Through staff attrition and internal promotion, higher cost employees' positions have been continued to be backfilled by lower cost, entry-level employees.
Juvenile revenue actuals from Title IV-E have been slightly higher than anticipated, and the Probation Department anticipates bringing in approximately $105,000 this year.
The Department is proposing the internal promotion of a DPO III to Supervising Deputy Probation Officer. The $8,070 will potentially be offset by Title IV-E revenue and increased compliance in the event of an audit.
SB 678 revenue is consistent with last year's allocation from the state.
The department received $30,750 from the state in FY 2015-16, and anticipates receiving it again in 2015-16. This money is related to the release of a 3-Judge Panel ruling that resulted in a temporary increase in cases transferred from state prisons.
The department's expenses related to incarceration in juvenile halls continue to trend downward: due in part to continued efforts to implement Evidence Based Practices. However, we had one commitment to the State Department of Juvenile Justice in 2015, which will cost the County $25,000 per year for the next 8 years. Therefore, we are being cautious in proposing $180,000 in juvenile incarceration expenditures. Per capita, this is substantially below the state average. 
 
This Budget Unit is funded by the State “AB 109” allocation through the Community Corrections Subaccount and does not draw from the Calaveras County General Fund. The major change in revenue for this unit has been stability. During the 2014/15 FY, a permanent formula was developed; thereby making it easier for the Community Corrections Partnership (CCP) to track and project annual revenues. As such, the 2016/17 FY Budget includes a $1,459,420 contribution from the State.
On March 25, 2016, the CCP Executive Committee voted unanimously to approve a FY 2016/17 spending plan that is very similar to the CCP Implementation Plan approved by the Board of Supervisors in December 2015. However, there are a few changes or additions worth noting:
Up to $130,000 per year has been approved to develop a “Work Crew” of offenders from the Day Reporting Center and the Jail. The costs will cover a new Correctional Officer’s salary, liability insurance, and equipment for the program.
Anger Management and Domestic Violence classes are now provided at the Day Reporting Center by certified Domestic Violence Facilitators as part of the Batterer Intervention Program.
An additional $40,000 for costs associated with incarcerating parolees and offenders on PostRelease Community Supervision in the Calaveras County Jail.
$12,000 for specialized training related to Evidence-Based Practices and enhanced enforcement.
$5,000 for sentencing training for the District Attorney’s Office due to the complexities of felony sentencing after realignment.
Up to $80,000 of one-time monies will be used for purchasing and implementing a new Case Management System (CMS) for the District Attorney’s Office. The District Attorney’s current CMS is antiquated and does not integrate with modern technology. The new system will be operational during the 2016/17 Fiscal Year and will advance data-driven decision making in Calaveras County.
The Day Reporting Center remains the highest expenditure from the AB 109 Unit and the transition away from anecdotal decisions and toward data-driven Evidence-Based Practices is ongoing. Program fidelity continues to improve in both the Day Reporting Center and the Calaveras County Jail, increasing the continuum of services throughout our local criminal justice system. 
The proposed budget for the Planning Department is within the net county cost of last year and meets the levels of service needs of the upcoming year. Funding for the General Plan update consultant contracts is carried over from previous encumbrances with contingencies for additional costs. Conservative estimates were again made for fee revenue. No new positions are requested. However, should the medical cannabis ordinance be adopted the department could see a significant increase in both revenue and workload. This will be discussed in more detail below.
Net County Cost
The proposed budget provides a net county cost of $898,378, which is under last year’s budget of $898,457.
General Plan Update
The top priority for the department continues to be the update of the General Plan and its associated Environmental Impact Report. In addition to the already encumbered amount to cover the existing contracts with Remy, Moose, and Manly for legal services (approximately $81,000) and the consultants for the plan and EIR, Raney Planning and Management ($214,000) and Augustine Planning Associates ($10,000), I have requested an additional $145,000 to cover potential costs if significant changes are necessary due to public comments during the adoption process or extensive additional work becomes necessary on the EIR in responding to comments in the Final EIR process. $10,000 has been allocated toward general plan implementation and other ordinances or special projects. This is a decrease from last year by $10,000.
Staffing
Currently filled positions are the Planning Director, three Planner III positions, three Planner IIs, and an Administrative Assistant II position. No new positions are requested. However, I anticipate that a significant increase in workload will occur when the medical cannabis
ordinance is adopted as directed by the Board. There are an estimated 800 to 1000 growers currently operating in the county. If only one quarter of those apply for permits next year, that will increase the number of administrative use permits and conditional use permits processed by the county by 200 or more. At the current rate of processing an AUP, it would take 2.8 persons to process those within the year. At the same time, an undetermined number of other permits associated with cannabis distribution, manufacturing, and indoor cultivation will require staff time and processing. The positive side of this is that those applications will bring in revenue in the form of application fees to offset the potential increase in staffing. The AUP fees alone would cover the costs of three new Planner II positions. The department will monitor the activity closely and work with Administration to see if a budget adjustment is warranted.
Revenue
Fee revenue has remained relatively flat during FY2015-16. As projected through the remainder of FY2015-16, it will be significantly lower than that received last year, although it is more than what was budgeted. Revenue projections remain the same for FY2016-17 with some minor modifications.
Other Expenses
Minor adjustments have been made in other expense items. Overall expenses such as office expenses, postage, printing, and rents have been adjusted to meet expected needs for the general plan, the level of development activity, and the public workshops for the FEMA map revision. Staff also anticipates the need to process two Environmental Impact Reports. One will be for the Hogan Quarry asphalt plant. Although the Air Pollution Control District is the lead agency, the Planning Department has been requested to assist that agency due to Planning’s CEQA expertise and lack of staff in the APCD. This will be pass-through expenses, however, fully funded by the applicant for the project. The other EIR will be for the Medical Cannabis Cultivation and Commerce Ordinance. Funds were set aside in the FY2015-16 budget for this and upon selection of a consultant the amount will be encumbered. There should be no additional costs associated with that for FY2016-17. It should be noted that the cost of preparing the EIR can be recouped by charging those benefiting from the ordinance, i.e. the cannabis-related businesses that will be submitting permit applications that will be permitted under the new ordinance. 
The Building Department and Code Compliance combined requested budget of $1,498,078.00 represents an overall increase of $162,510.00, or 20% in revenue and designated fund contribution and an increase of $34% in expenditures when compared to FY 2015/16 Adopted Recommended Budget. The Building Department does not receive a general fund contribution.
The designated fund contribution will be offsetting services and supplies and will include badly needed replacement vehicles, software and office equipment that has not been replaced for a number of years
SIGNIFICANT BUDGET CHANGES
Factors contributing to significant expenditure changes include:
The replacement of four vehicles. No vehicles have been replaced since 2004. These vehicles will replace high mileage vehicles that are operated every day and have become a maintenance liability.
At this time a decision has not been made concerning the addition of new Permit and Code Compliance software however a budgeted amount of $160,000 has been included to update software that has not been updated for at least 8 years and is no longer user friendly or updateable
Factors contributing to significant revenue changes include:
The Building Department has already met the 2015/2016 permit revenue projections and anticipate exceeding those projections by $150,000.00. Therefore projected revenues for 2016/2017 are 1,400.000.00
The Building Department is anticipating revenues of 1,598,078.00 million dollars due to an increase in building activity County wide and as a result of the rebuilding process triggered by the Butte Fire. Prior to the fire construction activity had been trending upward since 2012 and began to rise sharpiy in 2014 due to an improving economy and shrinking residential inventory. It is anticipated for the next three to five years that activity will continue to increase.
PENDING ISSUES AND/OR NEW POLICY CONSIDERATIONS
In general the construction industry is showing positive signs of increased activity throughout Calaveras County and the entire Western region of the United States.
To maintain competent service to the health and safety of the public and to authorize to build and authorize to occupy buildings in the county and increase in qualified staffing should be considered.
The Butte Fire has also begun to have its effects on the Building Department which is dedicated to providing quality customer service to the victims by expediting plan review, and streamlining the permit process. The new positions requested will be an integral part of the operations of the Department going forward with the increased building activity. 
In keeping with the direction of the County Administrative Office, the Environmental Health Department’s recommended budget is submitted meeting the FY 2015/16 General Fund contribution, with no net General Fund cost. The Department is proposing to expend $125,170.00 in grant funding including $60,000.00 in Certified Unified Program Agency (CUPA) Rural Reimbursement Account (RRA) funds. The RRA funding is a result of the passage of SB 1824 in 2000 of which staff helped author and has brought $60,000 to the Department annually since 2001. The amount of grant funds have been reduced by 50% for FY 16/17, which may result in the Department addressing our current fee structure in the future. The Department’s fee schedule has not been updated since 2009. The reduction in grant funds is due to the elimination of State and Federal grants.
The Department has been operating without 33% of the inspection staff, since the start of FY 15/16. In addition, the Department’s active participation in the response and debris removal program for the Butte Fire has had an impact on program implementation. The Department is actively working with Human Resources to fill the vacant positions and staff continues to work at a high level to try to meet all program mandates and public demands. The Department’s budget covers 35% of the Agency Administrator’s salary which is an increase of 23%. This increase is due to the vacant positions. The Department also reduced the vacant Manager position to 65% to help balance the increase of the Agency Administrator time in the Department.
In keeping with the direction of the County Administrative Office, the Onsite Wastewater Department FY 2016/17 recommended budget is being submitted meeting the FY 2015/16 General Fund contribution.
In FY 2015/16 a vacant Registered Environmental Health Specialist (REHS) II position was eliminated from the Department budget to maintain a status quo budget. This has resulted in one REHS II to cover the entire County to perform onsite wastewater (septic system) inspections. Environmental Health Department REHS staff continues to provide assistance in the Onsite Wastewater Department with inspections as necessary.
The elimination of the Registered Environmental Health Specialist II position remains a concern as the Department continues to experience an increase in permit activity over the past three years, as a result of a stronger housing market. As permit activity continues to increase, it may be necessary to add the position back into the Department at a future date. The Department had three full time inspectors at the time it joined the Agency in 2007.
The Animal Services Department FY 2016/17 recommended budget is being submitted meeting the targeted General Fund contribution.
In 2015 the BOS granted a second Animal Shelter Assistant position. This second position allows Animal Services to better provide the adequate services for the animals in our custody, especially after adding two more buildings for housing felines and the associated increase in workload. This added position also eliminated the need for an Animal Services Officer (ASO) to cover the shelter during holidays, vacation and weekends, an equivalent of about 0.25 FTE. The Department is proposing to leave the extra hire hours at last year’s levels: 250 hours for shelter assistance and 80 hours for front office assistance. The flexibility of extra hires is critical for a Department that has to operate seven days a week to cover possible emergencies.
In June of 2015 one ASO vacated the position, leaving the Department with only one ASO until a new ASO I was hired in September. In January, the most experienced ASO, accepted the second Shelter Assistant position, leaving this Department with only one ASO I. The Department is currently hiring a new ASO, but was unsuccessful in attracting an experienced officer. The salary level for these very challenging positions is competitive compared to most neighboring counties.
The fact that during most of this fiscal year the Department operated with only one ASO had a direct consequence in reduced revenue. This is a direct correlation between reduced staff which results in reduced licensing enforcement. In addition, during the weeks of Animal Services’ involvement with the response to the Butte fire, the Department was not able to conduct any revenue generating business. We do expect, assuming there will not be another disaster, to see revenues rise to FY 14/15 levels.
A ccomplishments
Our Animal Services volunteers continue to number over 100 individuals! Our volunteers clean cat cages and walk dogs on a daily basis while others help maintain the current shelter from weed eating the grounds to hanging shelves to painting our buildings. The Calaveras Humane Society (CHS) continues to be an invaluable partner in helping Animal Services meet all of its obligations along with FOCAS, whom has made great strides for an organization that was just formed in June of 2014. These two organizations, along with many other volunteers, assisted the Department during the Butte fire to provide temporary homes and proper care for about 400 impacted animals.
If it were not for the tremendous amount of work hours donated by our volunteers and the significant financial help as provided by CHS and FOCAS, Animal Services would not be able to meet several of its state mandates. 
The Department of Agriculture and Weights & Measures FY 2015/16 budget is being submitted meeting the targeted General Fund contribution (status quo) as directed. The Department is absorbing increases in A-87 costs (8,953) and staff salary step and benefits increases; however with the addition of DF reimbursement revenue we are able to meet the recommended general fund contribution. Additionally, Public Works has asked us to substantially increase the roadside spray program.
In keeping with the direction of the County Administrative Office, the Air Pollution Control District FY 2016/17 recommended budget is being submitted meeting the FY 15/16 General Fund contribution which in the case of the District is zero dollars. The current cash carry within the District is $32,460.00.
The District budget covers .28 Full Time Equivalents (FTE) of the Onsite Wastewater Department Permit Technician III position. The Permit Technician III assists the District in tracking APCD permits, performing file review, billing and issuance of burn permits. The District budget also covers .20 FTE of the Environmental Health Department Permit Technician II position. The Permit Technician II assists the District in billing and the issuance of burn permits, along with financial deposits. The District staffing is made up of 1.73 FTE’s.
The District is respectfully requesting a reclassification for the Air Pollution Control Technician position to the Air Pollution Control Specialist II position. The proposal also includes replacing the Air Pollution Control Technician to the Air Pollution Control Specialist I position creating a professional series. The current employee is performing duties, at a level equivalent to an Air Pollution Control Specialist II position in comparable districts. The employee is the sole inspector and full time employee for the District; no other staff has the technical expertise and the comprehensive knowledge of local, state and federal regulations. These duties are at a higher level than the Air Pollution Control Technician position. Prior to the Air Pollution Control Technician position, the District employee was a Deputy Air Pollution Control Officer.

Public Works Administration provides the staff necessary to support all administrative functions. The administrative costs are captured in this budget and then allocated to the other divisions of Public Works based on the proportionate services each unit receives. During fiscal year 2014/15 Public Works Administration began provided administrative support to the Facilities Division.
In Fiscal Year 2016/17 Administration will continue to be focused on creating and implementing the department wide safety programs. Additionally, we will initiate and complete the hiring process for vacant positions in Engineering, Roads and Bridges and Integrated Waste Management Divisions. We will continue to provide excellent services to our customers and contribute positively to the intergovernmental relationships in the County. 
Staffing
We have reevaluated the needs of the division and the budget impacts of our current staffing levels. We recommend reclassification of three positions to bring them in line with the activities of the division. As the structure of Public Works has evolved to consist of ten groups, the current structure with one Deputy to effectively manage all ten functional groups is not efficient and cannot be sustained. To solve this issue, we request a reclassification of the Business Administrator to a new position - Public Works Deputy Director of Finance, Administration and Support. The proposed Deputy Director position would directly manage the functional groups that do not involve engineering expertise. Additionally, we request a reclassification of the two Permit Technicians to Administrative Assistants. These changes will allow the department to provide the necessary administrative support and management at minimal cost as the total cost for these reclassifications is $35,869, annually. No additional positions are required. Finally, we request to move the Public Works Analyst I position to the Roads and Bridges budget unit, as her work is primarily in support of the Road Department and she is managing the storm water programs. 
The Equipment Service Center (ESC) was established as a stand-alone budget unit in FY 2007/ 08. The ESC operates on a cost recovery basis, and provides services to the various Public Works Divisions, and in FY 2011/12, it began servicing the Transit Fleet.
Currently, the Equipment Service Center staff consists of 9 positions including: an Administrative Analyst, Fleet Manager, 5 Mechanics, a Mechanics Helper, and an Administrative Services Officer I (50% FTE - vacant). In this recommended budget we are requesting to change the Administrative Services Officer I position from part-time to full-time. The impact to the Salaries and Benefits line items is an increase of $24,326. We believe that this change will be beneficial to the division and enable the administrative staff to provide additional support to operations staff as well as provide continuity within the administrative group. No other changes to staffing are proposed at this time.
Capital Projects and Purchases
This fiscal year Public Works is requesting to purchase a new tire alignment machine at approximately $25,000. 
Roads and Bridges staff provides road maintenance programs, snowplowing services, and roadside vegetation mitigation. Road crews also assist during emergencies throughout the County by responding to trees blocking roads, roadway flooding, and providing traffic control support and bagging stations during emergencies or extenuating occurrences. This past year has been especially difficult for our Road Maintenance Staff managing all of the road issues since the Butte Fire and an increase in infrastructure damage following 4 years of drought.
Budget Highlights
Roads and Bridges
Staffing
As of March of 2016, this division is nearly fully staffed following retirements and the filling of open positions. To retain current staffing, the proposed budget provides for promotions of qualified Road Maintenance Worker I staff to Road Maintenance Worker II positions. As current staffing resources are not sufficient to handle the Butte Fire permanent road repairs and hazardous tree removal programs in addition to upcoming responsibilities associated with other fire related grants, the proposed budget provides for an Administrative Analyst position. Finally, the Public Works Analyst position currently in the Public Works Administration budget unit is being realigned to the Roads and Bridges budget unit due to the nature of the responsibilities.
Funding Challenges
The financial picture related to road maintenance funding continues to be bleak. Estimates for the Highway User Tax Account show a reduction of approximately $380,000 over last year. Staff has worked diligently over the past two fiscal years to employ cost saving measures to help relieve the budgetary hardships.
The total cash carry available for use in fiscal year 2016/17 is projected to be about $1.87M, which is approximately $1.06M less than the prior fiscal year.
Capital Purchases
The division will purchase some equipment and vehicles this fiscal year that were carried over from 2015/16. The Department also recommends using a portion of these funds for needed capital improvements to the Jenny Lind Road Maintenance Yard and replacement of a generator at the Arnold Road Maintenance Yard. The Department is in the process of setting up the Designated Fund for Capital Equipment and Vehicles. Our goal is to deposit a minimum of $250,000 in that fund each year. 
The Transit unit is currently staffed by one full time position, Public Works Analyst, in Public Works. This position is responsible for overall program management, grant management, capital purchases and installations, marketing and outreach, compliance with state and federal regulations, equipment and vehicle maintenance through the Equipment Service Center, and the oversight of contract transit operations. The Calaveras County Council of Governments (CCOG) assists and supports the Public Works Department with program funding. The Auditor/Controller provides oversight and assistance with program reporting.
A long-term strategic visioning among the BOS, CCOG and City of Angels Camp will occur during the 2016/2017 fiscal year.
The Transit Budget has seen significant reductions in operating costs, due in part to a reduction in the cost of transit fleet maintenance. The budget for fiscal year 2016/17 projects $132,599 for fleet maintenance, split between the capital budget ($122,999) and the operations budget ($9,600). Staff anticipates that maintenance costs will continue in a positive direction because the aging fleet is being replaced by new buses and because of increased staff efficiencies from added experience, maintenance consistency and streamlined operations.
Through negotiations with Paratransit Services, the contract transit operator, the fixed hourly rate for the operations of our transit system was reduced from $33.73 to $29.98 per hour. This rate will remain in effect until June 30, 2017, at which time a new contract will be in place. The formal competitive bid process will take place during fiscal year 2016/17.
The Low Carbon Transit Operations Program (LCTOP) provided $14,549 in fiscal year 15/16 to fund a fare voucher (Green Ticket) program and Free Shuttle to the Calaveras County Fair to encourage ridership of transit. For fiscal year 2016/17, staff has received a grant from the same source for $44,235 to fund a pilot Saturday transit service.
While the Local Transportation Funding (LTF) source is experiencing annual reduction, in order to meet the goals established in the Short Range Transit Plan Calaveras Transit must increase the LTF budget for operations and capital in Fiscal Year 2016-17 from $523,432 to  
$570,807. This change is necessary to develop the new "Main Route" that will provide for 90- minute headways from Valley Springs to Columbia College. We anticipate that this change is critical to increase the ridership for years to come. Additionally, service alternatives will be implemented for underperforming routes as a means to cut costs and improve ridership.
Capital Purchases Budget Highlights
Three new El Dorado Nationals will be received and ready to begin service early in 2016/17. Funding for further bus replacements has not yet been identified. The 2016/17 budget will continue to have funds earmarked for construction and installation of bus shelters at locations in the County identified in the Bus Shelter Phase IV project. 
Overview of Budget Unit No. 1170-1900
Introduction
The Integrated Waste Division of Public Works operates the Rock Creek Landfill, 7 solid waste transfer stations, manages the closed Red Hill landfill site, partners with various business entities that supplement solid waste operations, and provides reporting and permit updates for funding and regulatory oversight. The current Integrated Waste Management system is primarily funded from the $150 per year parcel fee established in 1992. Of the $150 per year parcel fee, $10 was to be used on diversion programs. However, a greater amount of the fee is being used on diversion as the State has mandated ever-increasing diversion percentages requiring implementation of more robust programs. Although funding diversion programs have affected the distribution of revenue in Integrated Waste, the County has realized the benefits of landfill diversion through extended cell life. Note that Integrated Waste does not rely on any General Fund support.
Budget Highlights
Current issues
Completing a 2013 Compliance Order to bring diversion programs to current regulatory standards with full implementation by December 31, 2016
Current gate fee structure does not allow for cost recovery of disposed waste such as bulky items, large tires. The fee structure for green waste does not reflect current operational costs
Markets for recyclable commodities are depressed
Achieving and maintaining full staffing levels
Capital Projects
Continuation of 2015/16 Projects:
Replacement of Gatehouse structure
Construction of green waste/ concrete receiving areas at Rock Creek and Red Hill
Wilseyville Water Treatment Project
Wilseyville Green Waste Project
Recommended Budget
The Butte Fire Incident resulting in over 500 homes destroyed in the inferno has negatively impacted the IWM budget as $75,000 in solid waste fee revenue is projected to be lost. This incident along with insufficient staffing resources has delayed progress on various studies. This fiscal year IWM will be depositing $263,000 in the Solid Waste Capital Improvement Designated Fund and $250,000 in the Rock Creek Closure Designated Fund. There remains a structural deficit of approximately $1.1 million. 
budget year allocations and earnings as well as current information obtained by the various individual associations.
HUMAN SERVICES
The final allocations for programs overall will be known at the conclusion of the State legislative sessions
and after finalization of the State budget by the Governor.
Reclassifications - We are requesting reclassifications for the following positions:
Position #83-16 Social Worker I/II/III/IV - At the exit of the LCSW, Kelly Kirschten offered to assume responsibilities for teaching parenting and the Independent Living Program classes, given her various certifications for teaching parenting classes, while carrying a smaller caseload in Child Welfare. Both classes are mandatory for the Agency to provide on an ongoing basis. In checking with Merit Systems, Ms. Kirschten is eligible to be upgraded to a Social Worker III without reclassification within the Merit System. As Ms. Kirschten is performing work previously performed at a higher level, we are asking permission to reclassify her to a Social Worker III. This reclassification will be funded with State and Federal funds in the amount of an additional $4,173.
Position #83-20 Office Technician II - The merger of Health and Human Services has required a shifting of responsibilities within the Agency as well as the Human Services Division in order to accommodate the new structure. Susan Carter's position #83-49 Administrative Services Manager has changed significantly in liaison work with Human Resources and Merit System Services in addition to her confidential work with and for the Agency Director. As a result, Jessica Wharregard, Office Technician II, has assumed the day to day office administrative duties of supervisor for the clerical staff. In a reclassification study, Merit Systems Analyst, Karen Rodriguez, approved a reclassification of Jessica's position to the Merit Systems title of Office Assistant Supervisor and the County title of Administrative Services Manager I/II. We are asking permission to reclassify this position to Administrative Services Manager. This reclassification will be funded with State and Federal funds in the amount of an additional $3,230.

Position #83-42 Eligibility Worker III - Chele Beretz's current classification is an Eligibility Worker III. Chele's current primary responsibility is as the Veteran's Services Officer for Calaveras County. The past year, due to the growth in services of and for Veterans and their families, the Veterans program has added a Veteran's Services Representative and two clerical assistants, one from Title IV and the other is an extra hire clerical assistant I, to meet the new program demands. She has consistently worked to obtain additional funding and benefits for the present and former service connected residents. Due to the recent supervisory functions that were added to this position, we are requesting that it be reclassified as an Eligibility Supervisor I. This reclassification will be funded with State and Federal funds in the amount of an additional $5,633.
Position #83-63 Program Manager I/II - Kathy Houle is a Program Manager I for our Eligibility services. Under revised Merit Systems rules, Ms. Houle is eligible to be reclassified to a Program Manager II as she now oversees the Employment and Training unit as well. Merit Systems has revised the classification series of Program Manager as one classification. As she manages the largest work force in the division, 36 FTE, with the greatest diversity of program areas, a salary range for a Program Manager II is appropriate. This reclassification will be funded with State and Federal funds in the amount of an additional $10,697.
New Positions
Eligibility Worker III - The Human Services Division is negotiating with the District Attorney's Office to utilize part of their newly hired Investigator's time to perform the higher level tasks of the Fraud Program on cases where it is needed. The lower level functions of verification, we are proposing can be completed by an Eligibility Worker III. These tasks would include verifications, data and information matching. The new Eligibility Worker III position would include Fraud Prevention and Early Fraud Detection activities under the dual supervision of the Eligibility Program Manager and the Investigator. We are requesting to use one of our Eligibility Worker Position #83-26 from the "parking lot" for this position. The cost of this new position, including a computer, is $78,820 and will be funded with State and Federal funds.
Staff Services Analyst I/II - Initially, during the merger, position #83-37 Staff Services Analyst was transferred into the central position for the majority of Health and Human Services contracts. That has now consumed all of the position's allocation given the fact that Health and Human Services has more than 200 contracts. As a result, the Human Services Social Services unit has not had a main contact point for writing policies and procedures as well as centralizing all training needs and plans(s) reporting. Human Services is requesting replacement of its Staff Analyst position to meet current and emerging need given frequent changes in federal and state legislative mandates. The cost of this new position, including a computer, is $105,572 and will be funded with State and Federal funds.
Social Worker IV - Human Services is requesting permission to hire a Social Worker IV by January 2017 to meet the new federal and state mandates in child welfare for the Continuum of Care Reform for resource family approval. With the advent of the new calendar year, Child Welfare will be required to enable foster care/and or adoption parent applicants to go through a unified certification process to enable children, for whom adoption becomes the permanent placement recommendation, to have the adoption process expedited due to prequalified placement potentials. The current statute requires Masters in Social Work as the degree required for work in adoptions. 
• Social Worker I/II - The In-Home Supportive Services Program has continued steady growth and as of the first of March 2016, the caseload was 335. Additionally, due to a recent court ruling there are new FLSA standards and notifications, sanctions, tracking requirements and multiple contract requirements during the application process. The Adult Services Unit has four social workers currently providing IHSS, Adult Protection and Public Guardian Services as well as representative payee. This unit has remained active during and since the Butte Fire given the age and disabilities of impacted residents. We are therefore requesting a Social Worker I/II to meet current mandates.
The cost of this new position, including a computer, is $93,151 and will be funded with State and Federal funds.
Elimination of Pay Range
This is the third written request for consideration of elimination of pay range 7101 for entry level Eligibility Worker I. Currently the Office Technicians enter County employment at a higher salary range than the Eligibility Worker I. The A step for an Office Technician is $16.75 and the Eligibility Worker I is $15.82. The Eligibility Worker I series has a five step salary range, however after one year of successful employment, they become an Eligibility Worker II at a B step which is $18.24. A suggestion to rectify the issue is to eliminate the Eligibility Worker I pay range and start new hires at the A step of the current Eligibility Worker II which is $17.38. This move makes greater sense in the progression of the classification series and rectifies the salary issue. The change would also enable Office Technicians interested in becoming Eligibility Workers to apply without loss of income.
Vehicles
Due to the nature of the community service work the Human Services Division performs, we are requesting permission to purchase two 4-wheel drive vehicles. At present, there are just two 4-wheel drive vehicles in the fleet which proved to be inadequate during the Butte Fire and since. Additionally, since the advent of bringing previously contracted services in house, the number of staff in need of available transportation has increased.
o 2 computers - C-IV break fix o 1 computer/2 monitors for new Eligibility Workers o 1 computer/2 monitors for new Staff Services Analyst
Laserjet Printers - to replace old C-IV Printer that is over 5 years old
Laptop - 1 laptop station for new APS Social Worker
Microsoft Licenses - for people/computers added last fiscal year and 2015/16
Consulting Fee - recommended by TSD in the event of a problem with the microwave bridge that would need TSD assistance above what vendor would fix under warranty
County Allocations
The Human Services Division donates $500 towards the cost of the Children's Fair as the event is a good opportunity to provide information to attendees. The Fair is usually well attended by new parents.
Human Services is requesting to provide $5,000 toward the fuel charges for Common Grounds to transport senior citizens and disabled citizens to their medical appointments, particularly Veterans.
Human Services is also requesting to provide $5,000 to the Volunteer Center for transportation of elderly and disabled citizens.
County Contribution
The County's financial obligations for Human Services if approved are $310,894. Human Services is requesting renewal of the MOE funding obligation for provision of the current services.
Revenue Considerations
On March 10, 2016, at the County Welfare Director's Association meeting, Directors were informed that service to non-minor dependents by counties is optional and as such, the county's services to these clients are without an additional allocation. This ruling is contrary to previous discussion during the passage of AB12. At present, child welfare has fifteen non-minor dependents on the caseload with four more scheduled to enter within the new fiscal year. While the association will continue dialogue which state officials and legislators on this subject, the need to cover these costs including the workforce is present.
Health Realignment Transfer - Human Services has been historically each year transferring more than the ten percent (11.854%) to the health realignment account, specifically being used by Public Health to date. Given the need above, we are respectfully requesting to reduce the transfer to the mandated ten percent at this time so there are adequate funds for the non-minor dependents.
Health and Human Services is requesting $49,727 out of the County General Fund to cover the costs of the Veterans Services Representative. The salary and benefits of this position in addition to the MOU funds mandated as match to the federal funds for public benefits allocations. Additionally this position is in need of a computer as the one currently utilized is beyond its life span.
CHHSA received notification that its application for outreach to Veterans was granted at half of the amount requested. As a result, the Veterans Program is requesting permission to hire a .5 FTE Community Services Liaison to perform outreach as specified in the grant upon approval of the awarded contract by the Board of Supervisors. The cost of this position is $25,000.
Public Health funding is derived primarily from state and federal grants whose allocations are known at the conclusion of the federal and state legislative sessions and after the veto powers of the governor and president are completed.
This year Public Health has been notified to anticipate a 10% reduction in the Public Health Emergency Preparedness funding coming with the federal budget year which will begin in October 2016. Public Health is making the adjustment by having the Emergency Preparedness Manager assume all county functions for the Hospital Preparedness Program in lieu of a contracted service.
The Division will not be renewing their staff time and services to the Friday Night Live Program for FY 2016/17 as the program funding does not adequately cover staff time and costs. The program is very prescriptive and staff time and energy will be spent in other areas including development of a community wide Public Health needs assessment and outreach and education programs.
Cost Adjustment - Public Health is requesting permission to increase the cost for TBST to the public by six dollars to cover the increased cost of the TB Skin Test solution which is now at $62.13 per 10 dose vial. The new cost would be $23.00 per test and reading.
Request for New Positions
• Public Health Nurse I/II - Public Health is requesting permission to hire a PHN I/II to begin to serve the needs of the geriatric and disabled population. Given the census of Calaveras County having approximately 30% of the population at elderly and disabled, Public Health is desirous of having a specialist in the field to enable staff to more fully understand and serve the population. Previously and currently Public Health's primarily focused has been on children's issues given grant availability.
• Administrative Assistant - In order to support Hospital Preparedness activities, Public Health is requesting an Administrative Assistant for the Emergency Preparedness program. A number of the functions performed previously by the consultant and an extra hire will be performed by this position which includes coordinating the Hospital Preparedness Coalition meetings, setting up community meetings and trainings, inventory of medical supplies stationed countywide, and outreach and tracking of data, participating in multiple plan preparation, policies and procedures, reports and research. The position will work to develop volunteer network and CAHAN.
Equipment
Justification
Desktop PCs - 2 new computers for 2 new positions (with TrueUp) and 2 computers to replace old equipment. Additionally TrueUp for existing PCs that do not have licensing (total 4 computers and 4 TrueUp license).
Monitors - Larger monitor for fiscal and PH Manager to enable seeing larger spreadsheets.
Laptops - 2 new laptops with TrueUp for MCAH Nurse and IHSS nurse for home visits.
Mini iPad - Budgeted for use in the Tobacco Prevention Program and paid by that grant. For work done with students.
Projector - for the PHEP Grant when setting up the DOC (Department Operations Center).
Document Scanner - For PH Administrative Assistant II (works with sensitive personnel documents).
Contingency for fax/printer/copy machine - as well as various tech items such as mice, keyboards, cables, IronKey USB sticks, etc.
Vehicles
Public Health is requesting permission to purchase one vehicle to replace the 2003 Taurus.
Equipment
Public Health is also requesting permission to solidify and complete the purchase of a generator for the Human Services building which would be used as the main facility for health emergencies given their primary role in disasters of various origins. The Sequoia Room has been plumbed for the necessary hardware and two grants have been obtained to cover partial costs, one from the Sheriff's Department (OES) and the other from the Public Health Emergency Preparedness grant.
Revenue Transfer
Public Heath respectfully requests a total transfer of $250,000 from Fund Account 54170000 Health Capital Improvement Projects. Public Health is requesting permission to utilize $100,000 from this fund to put out to RFP for the management of a Resiliency Center/ Emergency Shelter for the first year management of the FY 2016/18 CDBG application for Calaveras County. At present the request for Center funding is $900,000. The additional $150,000 from this fund would allow Public Health to have sufficient reserves for the 2016-2017 year.
County Allocations
Public Health would like to once again contribute to the Children's Fair costs as the Fair provides the opportunity to distribute health information to new parents and families. Public Health is suggesting a contribution of two hundred fifty dollars $250. 
Mental Health is a carved out program within Medi-Cal. The services they offer are restricted to the severely mentally ill. Behavioral Health actually runs its own risk pool similar to a managed care plan which is for the eligible population.
There are three main sets of revenue, Medi-Cal, MHSA and realignment.
New Position Request and Elimination
• Program Coordinator II - With the advent of the Senior Administrative Analyst working 50% of the time in HHSA administration on grant writing, lower level work that she does can be transferred and augmented by a Program Coordinator II. This will also increase outreach time to the community which is needed given the continued issue of stigmatization and Suicide Prevention. Behavioral Health is also requesting the ability to purchase a computer for this function.
In return Behavioral Health is requesting elimination of positions listed below:
Position #52-19 Account Technician II
Position #52-54 Community Health Assistant
Position #52-55 Office Technician I/II
Position #52-38 Community Services Liaison
Equipment
As Behavioral Health continues to move towards total electronic health records there is a need for additional scanners with software for all staff with the exception of the transporters. Behavioral Health has the opportunity to access MHSA technology funding for the projected fiscal funding year that will cover this cost. Telephone replacement for Behavioral Health staff is scheduled to begin with the purchase of ten telephones this year. The upgrade is needed due to the obsolescence of the hardware and software.
The following IT equipment is needed for Behavioral Health:
Justification
Computers - Computers and laptop are replacing hardware that is over 5 years old.
ScanSnaps - for new electronic health records module
Monitors - Extra for break/fix
Phones - to replace end of life phones
Livingroom - Comcast and Alarm service at new Livingroom location
Revenue transfer
Given the increase in placement costs in 2015/2016, Mental Health is requesting to transfer back its fund deposits from account 54170000 Health Capital Improvement Projects that was established in FY 2005/06 which equates to $300,000. These funds were originally set aside for a possible building for Health Services that did not materialize.
Mental Health cost increases in 2016/17 are in its professional services line item due to the transition to telepsychiatry, crisis worker coverage, supportive employment and client supportive housing and Veterans stipends and managed care.
County Contribution
The County's financial obligations for Behavioral Health, if approved are $7129.00. Behavioral Health is requesting renewal of the MOE funding obligation for provision of the current services.
County Allocations
Mental Health also is requesting Board approval to provide $500 towards the cost of the Children's Fair as the outreach capacity for families particularly new parents is an excellent source of information distribution.
Changes to Staffing Costs
Changes to staffing costs will include the CCP staff working via FEMA funding through 10/14/16 and the expectation of three Clinicians receiving certification and thus being eligible to promote to a II status. Reclassification
Mental Health is requesting reclassification of position 52-34 Account Technician II to an Account Technician III. While creating appropriate infrastructure due the merge, it was determined that the Accounting Technician position originally requested at a II level actually requires a greater skill set such as a III due to the complex funding and multiple reporting and oversight required. The current
incumbent has able to offer his increased his knowledge and expertise in Substance Abuse as well as Mental Health precluding the need for a separate accounting position for Substance Abuse.
Vehicle
Lastly the agency is requesting permission to purchase one vehicle for transportation of clients to court, services, and placement. 
The Substance Abuse budget for FY 2016/17 has no significant changes other than the increase in A87 charges. Substance Abuse is requesting to make a $1,000 contribution to the Grad Night Foundation as this function is pivotal to validating the changes graduates and making in their lives and that of their families.
Of note in programming is the deletion of Friday Night Live as currently there are no known interested parties in provision of this service in schools. Emphasis will be placed on other outreach and prevention services to the youth population after further research and study.
