CAO’s Recommendation
The Department of Agriculture has a number of
Standard Agreements and other revenue
distributions from the California Department of
Food & Agriculture (CDFA) and the Department
of Pesticide Regulation (DPR) as well as pass –
through money from the United States
Department of Agriculture (USDA). The revenue
from these sources varies from year to year. As
a precaution, and in order to prevent layoffs, the
Department of Agriculture has held 1.5 positions
vacant, resulting in $85,484 potential savings in
salaries and benefits. The Department will
continue this practice until the revenue streams
stabilize.
The FY 2015-16 Recommended Budget for the
Department of Agriculture is balanced while
maintaining current service levels. Any
additional reductions may limit the department’s
application for unclaimed gas tax revenue in
jeopardy. California Food and Agricultural Code
(FAC) Section 224 (g) states that counties must
maintain a certain level of County General Fund
support or risk the loss of unclaimed gas tax
revenue.

CAO’s Recommendation
The baseline net County cost reflects a
$1,000,000 increase from the fiscal year 2014-
15 budget. This increase is due in large part
to estimated salary and benefit costs.
The Assessor’s Office has experienced a high
level of turnover in the past few years resulting
from resignations and retirements. The
Department currently has 25 vacant positions
out of 122 authorized positions, which
represents a 21% reduction in workforce.
Reduced staffing levels make it extremely
difficult for the Department to close the regular
and supplemental assessment rolls in a timely
manner, and make it difficult to meet the
statutory program obligations of the office.
The Assessor’s Office will continue to work
with the Human Resources Department to
recruit aggressively in order to maximize
staffing within authorized levels.

CAO’s Recommendation
Baseline Budget
The baseline net County cost reflects a $82,500
decrease from the fiscal year 2014-15 Adjusted
Budget.
Salary and benefit cost estimates have
decreased by $63,402 due to reduced employee
group insurance and retirement expenses.
Baseline costs for services and supplies reflect a
reduction of $112,546, which will offset the
anticipated $90,875 decrease in revenues and
$2,573 decrease in expenditure transfers.
Recommended Budget
The County Administrator is recommending no
reduction to the Auditor-Controller’s baseline
budget. The recommended net County cost will
provide the funding necessary to maintain
mandated services and maintain present staffing
levels in fiscal year 2015-16.

CAO’s Recommendation
This Budget covers the administrative
requirements of the Board’s operations.
Services and Supplies include the costs of
memberships in the California State Association
of Counties (CSAC), Association of Bay Area
Governments (ABAG), Urban County Caucus
(UCC) and National Association of Counties
(NACO). Services and Supplies also include
electronic support of the County Code as well as
funding for the Countywide Single Audit.
The County Administrator is recommending full
funding of the Board of Supervisor’s baseline
budget. The difference in appropriations
between prior year and current year is due to
fund balance in Board Mitigation Programs.
These funds will be added to FY 2015-16 at the
end of the current fiscal year when amounts are
known.
Salary and benefit costs include the additional
$50,900 estimated for the Board of Supervisors
salary adjustment proposed to take effect June
1, 2015. However, overall salary and benefit
projections are $122,497 lower than the FY
2014-15 Adjusted Budget.
As has been budgeted in prior years, an
expenditure transfer of CC Futures monies will
offset costs of $67,500 in the District IV Office.
These funds are from deposits of Transient
Occupancy Tax received from the Renaissance
Club Sport and Embassy Suites properties that
were directed to the CC Futures budget unit.
When these CC Futures monies are depleted,
general purpose revenue will supplant these
funds to maintain staffing parity amongst district
offices.
The projected salary and benefit costs assume
that the District V Office will continue to receive
$100,000 of Keller Canyon Mitigation Funding to
support staffing needs.
Annual allocations of $36,000 will continue to
support the operations of the twelve Municipal
Advisory Councils, which the Board of
Supervisors’ district offices oversee.

CAO’s Recommendation
The fiscal year 2015-16 baseline net County
cost decreased by $6,938,602 due to the
elimination of restricted prior year fund balance
of $2,800,299 for Facilities Lifecycle
Improvement (FLIP) and $5,138,303 for Plant
Acquisition. The recommended budget is $5
million higher than baseline.
The baseline and recommended budgets
include transfers and revenue totaling $750,000
for FLIP projects on a cost-per-foot basis for
future projects.
The recommended budget for Minor Capital
Improvements is a net County cost of
$1,500,000, which is available on an emergency
basis for minor improvements when there is no
other funding available. The recommended
budget for Facilities Lifecycle Improvements is a
net County cost of $10,000,000, which reflects
the amount allocated to deferred facilities
maintenance and capital renewal from the
County’s Tax Losses Reserve.
The recommended budget also includes funding
for the Plant Acquisition cost center. This
allocation of general purpose revenue, in the
amount of $5,000,000, is intended as an ongoing
resource for construction and repair of
County facilities. The monies can be used for
capital projects and/or debt service for a future
infrastructure borrowing program.

CAO’s Recommendation
The recommended budget for Central Support
Services reflects a net County cost of
$6,387,252. This amount will fund the
aforementioned departments, enabling them to
provide the current level of services into fiscal
year 2015-16. Additionally, appropriations were
added to fund an additional information
technology position in the Risk Management
Department to support the Countywide Training
Program.

CAO’s Recommendation
The FY 2015-16 Baseline and Recommended
net County cost is reduced by $794,297 from the
FY 2014-15 adjusted budget because the only
major election scheduled and budgeted for in
the new fiscal year is the June 2016 Presidential
Primary Election. Should Governor Brown,
however, call any mid-year special elections
during FY 2015-16 as he did in the current fiscal
year, the Department will require an augmentation
from County Reserves.
Streamlined election processes have reduced
both expenditures and outside agency
reimbursements for election services. The
provision for Salaries and Benefits has also
been reduced from current year budgeted levels
to reflect the current level of staff vacancies.
The Recommended Budget includes a vacancy
factor of $819,209, which will prohibit the
department from filling all of its authorized
positions in order to operate within the budget.
The Recommended Budget will be sufficient to
maintain operations at the current service level.
The Department’s General Fund revenue is
projected to decrease from the current year
budgeted level by $1,172,101, which is primarily
attributable to recording fees revenue
decreases. The department continues to absorb
SB90 and other uncompensated Statemandated
expenses due to the State’s
suspension of certain local reimbursements.
The Recorder Division’s negative net County
cost (budgetary surplus) continues to offset a
portion of the Election Division’s net County
cost, but to a lesser degree than in prior years
as recording volume continues to recover at a
slow pace due to delayed recovery in the
housing market and trends in how mortgages
are being handled in the industry.

CAO’s Recommendation
Land Development Fund
DCD’s operations are funded primarily through
the Land Development Fund (programs funded
in the General Fund are discussed separately
below.)
DCD’s Baseline and Recommended Budgets of
$27,077,321 reflect a modest reduction by
$168,420 over the current year budget. Salaries
and benefits total $20,778,203, an increase of
$313,848 over the current year. The increase
can be primarily attributed to the two additional
positions that were added in the current year.
During FY 2014/15, DCD increased its Land
Development Fund staffing from the 2013/14
level of 156 by a net of two FTE positions
(elimination of 3 Weatherization Program
positions plus addition of 4 Planners and 1
Principal Building Inspector positions), bringing
the Baseline FTE up to 158 positions. Services
and Supplies expense has been reduced from
the current year amount by $663,919 due to
DCD’s decision to scale down its use of
contracted services. Other Charges and Fixed
Assets were increased modestly to account for
anticipated increases in liability insurance and
data server expenses. Land development
revenues are expected to align with expenses.
There are no significant changes anticipated in
FY 2015-16.
The Weatherization Program continues to
operate on a smaller scale with the loss of
ARRA and EECBG funding. This loss of funding
is mitigated by receipt of the Bay Area Regional
Network grant, which supports operation of the
Energy Upgrade Program.
DCD relies entirely on outside revenue sources
(such as construction permits, land development
fees, inspection fees, franchise fees and
intergovernmental revenue) to fund its Land
Development operations. DCD revenues are
closely tied to economic factors affecting
development activities by private parties. While
reasonable assumptions and trends were
considered in projecting DCD revenues for FY
2015-16, actual revenues will depend on several
economic variables. The uptick in construction
development is promising but DCD is cautiously

optimistic and will continue to closely monitor its
revenue trends.
General Fund Programs
DCD administers numerous programs that are
budgeted in the General Fund, including Keller
Canyon Landfill Mitigation and Housing
Rehabilitation, which are local discretionary
programs, and a variety of federal grant
programs.
DCD’s Baseline and Recommended General
Fund budgets are $12,052,195, a reduction of
$398,269 from the current year budget. This
reduction is primarily attributed to the anticipated
federal program reductions (HOME and
HOPWA). It is important to note, however, that
while the overall budget has been reduced,
Salaries and Benefits have been increased by
$207,872, and a General Fund subsidy of
$200,000 is provided for additional support
needed for a county sustainability program. The
other line items (Services and Supplies, Other
Charges and Expenditure Transfers) reflect
budget adjustments to align with anticipated
reductions in federal programs.
Other Special Revenue Programs
DCD administers funds for the Abandoned
Vehicle Abatement Service Authority collection
and disbursement of State funds to the cities
and County for reimbursement of costs related
to the abatement of abandoned vehicles. In FY
2012-13 the Auditor redesignated this County
Special Fund as a New Agency Fund. As such,
funds are no longer appropriated in the County
Budget; however, DCD will continue to
administer the collection and disbursement of
State funds to the cities and County in FY 2015-
16.

CAO’s Recommendation
The fiscal year 2015-16 baseline net County
cost decreased by $4,271,835 from fiscal year
2014-15. The reduction reflects the elimination
of restricted prior year fund balance of
$4,506,819 primarily from CATV franchise fees.
Operating costs increased by $234,984 for
salary and benefits, interdepartmental charges
and non-county professional services.
The recommended net County cost of
$5,125,000 will provide the funding necessary to
maintain services in fiscal year 2015-16.

CAO’s Recommendation
The baseline net County cost reflects a
$236,250 increase over the FY 2014-15
Adjusted Budget.
Salary and benefit costs increased by $342,436
and are mainly due to increases in permanent
and temporary salaries. Included in this
increase are estimated costs of $157,000, which
the County Counsel Office will charge to the
Health Services Department for legal counsel
and support services provided to implement
Laura’s Law.
In addition to Laura’s Law, additional legal
counsel and support services are anticipated,
which result in an estimated increase of
$137,718 in revenues and expenditure transfers
combined.
The County Administrator is recommending a
net County cost for FY 2015-16 of $2,650,000,
which will require a reduction of $6,250. This
reduction will have minimal impact on the
County Counsel’s Office operations and will be
absorbed by operational efficiencies and careful
monitoring of office supplies expenses.

CAO’s Recommendation
The Baseline budget reflects a decrease of
$76,000 from FY 2014-15. Prior year fund
balance in the amount of $60,000 was
eliminated from the baseline budget for FY
2015-16 and a further $16,000 was reduced to
match estimated expenditures. The budget is
estimated based on prior year trends of
assessed valuations. The actual return-tosource
shares are determined each year in the
Fall.

CAO’s Recommendation
The FY 2015-16 budget does not include ad
valorem property tax revenues to the County
from the West Contra Costa Healthcare District.
Although the latest agreement, adopted
December 2, 2014, did not yet positively
eliminate the FY 2015-16 transfer, it did set in
motion the potential of a three year permanent
waiver of property tax allocations beginning in
FY 2015-16. The tax transfer has been
approximately $3 million each year (dependent
upon tax generation) and was due to continue
until approximately FY 2019-20. Each year’s
transfer will appear as a negative net County
cost in our schedules.
Transfers for the Retirement UAAL Bond and
Retirement Litigation Settlement Debt service
expenses are budgeted in each department as a
compensation expense. The increase for the
Retirement UAAL Bond in FY 2015-16 is due to
a 11.7% growth in principal payment netted
against a 7.5% reduction in interest. The total
payment will increase by a net of approximately
4.2% each year until it is retired in 2024.
We do not anticipate issuing Tax Revenue
Anticipation Notes (TRANs) in FY 2015-16.

CAO Recommendation
The 2015/16 Recommended Budget for the
Department of Information Technology reflects
no increase in net County cost because all cost
increases are charged out to service recipients.
Expenditures and revenues are increased by
$1,674,118 from the 2014/15 Budget, due to the
net impact of reduced staff retirement costs and
increased appropriations for specialized
mainframe services and support, software
licenses, hardware and software maintenance,
manufacturer annual cost increases, system
security, and the replacement of aging
equipment. Provision for specialized contract
services are augmented due to the retirement of
staff essential in supporting the County
mainframe and whose knowledge and skills are
scarce and no longer available within the County
workforce. The Recommended Budget also
provides for services required to complete
Federal Communications Commission licensing
requirements for the County’s
telecommunications systems.
Wide Area Network (WAN) rates are increased
by 10% and telephone line/port rates are
increased by 14% from the current year rates to
offset the recommended expenditure increases.
A General Fund allocation of $95,000 is
recommended to offset unreimbursed costs
related to the implementation of the East Bay
Regional Communications System.

CAO’s Recommendation
The Baseline Budget reflects a net decrease of
$7,126,705. The net decrease reflects the
elimination of prior year fund balance totaling
$9,870,505 as well as a decrease of $45,559 for
anticipated reductions in retiree health costs. An
upgrade to the PeopleSoft system is anticipated
in fiscal year 2015-16 and $2,789,359 has been
added to the budget for that purpose. The total
net change is a decrease of $7,126,705 from the
current year.
The recommended budget reflects sufficient
funding in order to maintain the County payroll
and benefits system as well as funding for
retiree health benefits for Court employees and
other retirees that cannot be attributed, and
therefore charged, to current departments.

CAO’s Recommendation
In the past, the Recommended Budget for
General Fund departments relied on significant
increases in General Purpose Revenue to offset
increases in the cost of doing business.
Normally, the most significant increases in
revenue from year-to-year are due to increased
assessed valuation on current secured property
tax. Over the past few years, the economic
downturn has eliminated growth in assessed
valuation, significantly reduced interest rates,
and greatly impacted Supplemental Property
Tax revenues. In the past three fiscal years,
assessed values have begun to experience
growth. The State Board of Equalization has
announced an inflation factor of just under two
percent* (1.01998) for FY 2015-16; however, the
County Administrator’s Office is projecting that
assessed value growth will be at least 6%. The
6% figure compares to current year growth of
9.09%, FY 2013-14 growth of 3.45% and 0.86%
growth in FY 2012-13.
It should be noted that Recommended General
Purpose Revenues include $10 million in
transfers from the Tax Losses Reserve Fund for
deferred facility maintenance projects. This
extra $10 million is not a permanent source of
funding.

CAO’s Recommendation
The Baseline budget for fiscal year 2015-16
reflects a net decrease of $1,306,420 from the
current year. The reduction reflects the removal
of restricted, prior year fund balance totaling
$2,275,514 for Benefits Administration and
Employee Child Care. Salary and benefit costs
increased by $737,409. General operating costs
are estimated to increase by $269,840 to cover
interdepartmental charges, increased costs for
professional/specialized services, and costs
attributed to the remodel of the Personnel
Services Unit. Revenue increased by $38,155
for benefits administration costs.

CAO’s Recommendation
Baseline costs for salaries and benefits are
increased over the current year budget due to
cost of living increases and the addition of 2.9
FTE. The recommended budget increased by
$94,639 from the Baseline, reflecting the
addition of one Library Specialist position to
support children’s programming, which
increased the Library overall FTE total by 3.9.
Baseline services and supplies are reduced to
reflect one-time purchases in 2014-15 of
equipment, computers, and materials. Baseline
costs for other charges are reduced due to onetime
appropriations in 2014-15 for facilities
maintenance costs. The Library has estimated
an increase of 6% in property tax revenue,
which will enable the Library to absorb increases
to salaries and benefit costs. The Library
continues to be an innovative support to the
community.

CAO’s Recommendation
Public Works increased the fiscal year 2015-16
General Fund baseline budget by a net of
$1,521,500. The increase reflects the following:
$100,000 added to support the County Surveyor
function mandated by Government Code
§27550, 27600 & 27601; $700,000 to support
County General Drainage Maintenance;
$200,000 for costs relating to the oversight and
administration of Special Districts; and,
$300,000 for matching funds to implement
projects in County Service Areas. An additional
$317,000 was added for Other Post
Employment Benefits in Facilities Maintenance.
The recommended budget reflects the net
addition of one position in Print and Mail
Services and the addition of two positions in
Public Works, totaling $160,000. The
department will eliminate a vacant Storekeeper,
a vacant Lead Print and Mail Services
Technician, a vacant Reprographics Technician
and add two Mailing Machine Operators and two
Office Services Worker positions in Print and
Mail Services as well as add two Environmental
Analyst positions in Public Works. This action

will allow the Department to better manage
anticipated workflow in fiscal year 2015-16. The
costs of the additional positions will be
recovered through charge-outs to outside
agencies, other County departments and
Special Revenue funds. The County
Administrator recommends the additional
positions to better meet the needs of County
departments and the management of large scale
environmental and capital projects.
The Fleet Internal Service Fund decreased
revenues and expenditures by $466,846. The
budget was adjusted to reflect salary and benefit
costs plus anticipated operations costs – such
as vehicle repairs – and corresponding revenue
from billings and revenue transfers. The
reduction is mainly due to a decrease in capital
acquisition costs.
The Road Fund Budget decreased by a net of
$12.4 million to reflect the elimination of prior
year fund balance. Revenue totaling
$48,803,815 reflects anticipated federal funds
for the Orwood Road Bridge Replacement, the
Marsh Creek Road Safety Project, the Alhambra
Valley Road Safety Project and other revenue
funds for the Balfour Road Shoulder Widening
Project and County-wide Overlay Project.
The Land Development Fund, which supports
engineering functions, was decreased by a net
of $612,411. The net fund cost decrease
reflects the removal of prior year fund balance.
Revenues were decreased by $390,000 to
reflect anticipated revenues generated from land
development permits.
The Airport Enterprise fund, which supports
airport operations and capital development at
the Buchanan and Byron Airports decreased
expenditures and revenues by $817,363. Fixed
assets were reduced, reflecting a decline in the
number of airport improvement projects that
receive federal reimbursement.
Public Works continues to respond to the
growing challenges by proactively identifying
areas in its operations that can be modified,
streamlined, and/or restructured for better
service and cost efficiency, as well as
maintaining operations within their baseline
budget.

CAO’s Recommendation
Baseline Budget
The baseline net County cost represents a
$218,000 increase over the FY 2014-15
Adjusted Budget. Salary and benefit costs
reflect a decrease of $8,680. Reduced
retirement and retiree health care expenses are
expected to offset the increases in permanent
salaries and worker’s compensation insurance.
Services and supplies reflect an increase of
$204,488 in operating costs, mainly due to the
increased fees of legally obligated expenses and
increasing information technology data
processing services needed to support the
Office’s systems. To the contrary, estimated
revenues are expected to continue to decrease
by $22,650 in FY 2015-2016.
As homeowners for new purchases are forced
into impound accounts, the declining number of
new delinquencies has limited the amount of
service costs and redemption fees that have the
potential to be collected. In addition, investment
income is at a record low, as short term interest
rates remain well below 1%.
Recommended Budget
The County Administrator is recommending no
reduction to the Treasurer-Tax Collector’s
baseline budget. The recommended net County
cost will provide the funding necessary to
maintain mandated services in FY 2015-2016.

CAO Recommendation
In the FY 2015-16 Baseline Budget expenditures
are anticipated to decrease slightly compared to
the FY 2014-15 budget. This reduction is due to
anticipated salary saving. Baseline revenue is
expected to decrease slightly from the FY 2014-
15 budget.
The FY 2015-16 Recommended Budget for the
Department of Child Support Services maintains
current service levels. There are no reductions
from the Baseline Budget.

CAO Recommendation
The Employment and Human Services
Department (EHSD) continues to rebuild its
infrastructure and resources, carefully adding
capacity to respond to a dramatic increase in
Medi-Cal cases as a result of the Affordable
Care Act. Medi-Cal caseloads, representing
low-income Contra Costa residents who now
have health coverage, increased from 66,358 in
February 2014 to 108,718 in February 2015, a
63.8% increase. The Department also
successfully negotiated a multiyear agreement
with Covered California to continue to operate
one of three Call Centers in the state to handle
Affordable Care Act enrollments and
reenrollments.
EHSD currently does not have State funding
allocations for FY 2015-16. The Department has
included estimated revenue based on the
Governor’s FY 2015-16 Proposed Budget and
historical allocation information. EHSD will
return to the Board of Supervisors in the fall with
a request for adjustments to the appropriations
should they be necessary once the final
allocations are received.
The FY 2015-16 Recommended Budget for
Employment and Human Services is balanced
while cautiously expanding the current level of
service.

CAO Recommendation
The 2015-16 Recommended Budget funds the
General Fund programs within the Health
Services Department at the baseline level. This
is an increase in expenditures of $17.5 million
over the fiscal year 2014-15 level. The bulk of
this increase is due to adjustments in outside
funding. County general funds have been
increased by $161,356.
The Health Services Department 2015-16
Recommended Budget is based on what is
currently known regarding federal and State
revenue that will be available in the next fiscal
year. The assumptions regarding State
revenues are based on the 2015-16 fiscal year
Governor’s Budget and may change as the
California State Legislature considers the
Governor’s recommendations. The Department
will return to the Board of Supervisors in the fall
with recommended adjustments should funding
from either the State or the federal government
significantly change.
The 2015-16 Recommended Budget for ALL
programs and funding sources in the Health
Services Department totals $1.447 billion
dollars. Of this amount, $85.4 million, or 5.9% is
County General Fund, including a $26.7
million contribution to the Hospital and Clinics
and a $3.7 million contribution to the Contra
Costa Health Plan. The balance of nearly

$1.362 billion or 94.1% is funded by outside
revenue.
The 2015-16 Recommended Budget maintains
the current, baseline spending levels. Services
levels may be adjusted depending up final
budget actions at the State and federal level.

CAO’s Recommendation
The Department’s baseline budget fully funds
on-going services for FY 2015-16. Total
expenditures have increased by $123,273 from
the current year largely due to increases in
permanent salary and benefit costs.
The County Administrator is recommending no
reduction to the Veterans Service Office
baseline budget. Services and supplies reflect
an increase of $39,195, which will support the
department’s outreach efforts to better serve
veterans and their families.
The department is expecting a $9,553 increase
of revenues in FY 2015-16 from State Aid
Veteran Affairs, which will slightly offset the
increased operational costs.

CAO’s Recommendation
The Animal Services Department FY 2015-16
Baseline Budget increased by 6.6% compared
to the FY 2014-15 Budget through increases in
operating expenses.
The Department will implement a variety of
strategies to increase revenues to offset the
increased expenses. These include the
utilization of new scanning software to upload
rabies certifications from veterinary offices, the
implementation of a new ordinance that requires
all dog owners to license their animals or face
an enforceable fine, the automated mailing of
multiple notices to new and existing dog owners,
and online purchasing of animal licenses. In
addition, the Department anticipates an
additional $249,728 in City Contract revenue in
FY 2015-16. City Contract revenues are
determined on a per capita basis. A slight
increase in Contra Costa population, as
determined by the California State Department
of Finance, in concert with a fee increase of
$0.25 per capita, will result in the increased City
Contract revenue.
The Recommended Budget reflects modest
increases in Spay & Neuter revenues and Pet
Sales in the amounts of $9,846 and $2,000,
respectively. Revenues resulting from the above
listed sources, along with an increase of
$625,000 in County General fund allocation are
projected to be sufficient to accommodate the
increased expenses. The Animal Care and

CAO’s Recommendation
The County currently and has for many years
contracted with the Contra Costa County Bar
Association to provide conflict legal defense
services through private attorneys. Costs had
been trending upward due to an increase in the
number of homicide and capital cases referred to
the Bar, many of which involved multiple
defendants requiring separate legal
representation. In 2010, the County negotiated a
new contract with the Bar that incorporated
improved cost controls and presumptive
maximum fees, which have helped to reduce
overall program costs.
The Recommended Budget provides for the
continuation of services with the Bar. Due to a
continued rise in caseloads referred by the
Public Defender during fiscal years 2013-14 and
2014-15, the Recommended Budget includes
appropriations estimated to be required to reach
a final disposition for the bulk of those cases.
The level of service for this program is mandated
pursuant to constitutional requirements. Should
the recommended appropriations prove
insufficient to fund the requisite level of defense
services, it will be necessary to shift resources to
this budget center from other programs or
County reserve.

CAO’s Recommendation
The FY 2015-16 Baseline Budget increases
expenditure appropriations by $414,355, or
1.2% and decreases estimated revenue by
$265,171, or 1.4%, resulting in an increase to
net County cost of $679,526.
The Recommended Budget increases net
County cost by $2 million, which funds the
baseline budget and augments department
operations by an additional $1.3 million. The
additional $1.3 million funds 7 new positions:
four Deputy District Attorney-Basic positions,
one Administrative Services Assistant II position
to serve as the departmental grant writer, one
Crime Scene Investigator (CSI) Specialist and
one Victim/Witness Program Specialist position.
In addition, the budgeted vacancy factor is
reduced by $252,697 from the FY 2014-15 level
to a new vacancy factor of $432,391 for FY
2015-16.
The District Attorney’s office continues to work
aggressively on new crime prevention initiatives
in addition to managing responsibilities
associated with AB 109. The County
Administrator’s Office acknowledges this
continued effort and believes that the
Recommended Budget reflects a balance
between continued funding of new initiatives and
preserving mandated, mainline prosecution
responsibilities within the District Attorney’s
Office.
Note: The County Administrator has developed
recommendations based on service level impacts
communicated by the District Attorney’s Office. It is
acknowledged that the District Attorney is an elected
official and has ultimate discretion on how to best
deploy resources within his Office using
appropriations allocated by the Board of
Supervisors.

CAO’s Recommendation
The Baseline Budget is reduced from the current
year by $4,707,048 due to the removal of prioryear
fund balance in the amount of $3,878,185
from Law & Justice Systems Development and
$827,863 from the Vehicle Theft program.
Revenues are reduced from the current year
levels by $1,091,791 due to the elimination of a
one-time recoupment of lease-purchase
financing for the abandoned Justware case
management system in the amount of
$1,083,518 and a reduction in user charges in
the amount of $32,650, offset by an increase in
Vehicle License Fees of $24,377.
The Recommended Budget reduces
appropriations in Law & Justice Systems
Development by $128,000 in order to fund the
first year of Superior Court costs of the County’s
implementation of Laura’s Law, a court-ordered
assisted outpatient mental health treatment
program. For additional information, see
Superior Court Related Functions.

CAO’s Recommendation
The FY 2015-16 Recommended Budget
increases expenditure appropriations by $2.3
million or 3.4%, and estimated revenue by $1.2
million or 4.4%. The resulting net County cost is
an increase of $1.1 million, which funds the
department’s negotiated and anticipated salary
and benefit increases as well as nine new
positions at Juvenile Hall added in FY 2014-15.
The Department is facing a $2 million reduction
in federal assistance, namely Title IV-E preplacement
administration claims for youth at
imminent risk of foster care placement.
Additionally, the Department is anticipating
increased operating costs attributable to
detention medical expenses as well as courtordered
custodial care placement trends.
The recommended budget funds the baseline
services with minimal impact to the Department.
One Collection position was eliminated due to
decreasing caseloads in the Probation
Collection Unit, but there is no impact to the
department’s continued vacancy factor of $1.37
million.

CAO’s Recommendation
The Public Defender’s FY 2015-16 Baseline
Budget increases expenditure appropriations by
$426,170 or 2.1%, and estimated revenue by
$209,917 or 14.3%, resulting in an increase in
net County cost of $216,253 or 1.2%.
The Recommended Budget increases net
County cost by $815,912, which reflects the
addition of six positions. Three new Deputy
Public Defenders will alleviate the department’s
increasing reliance on temporary special
assignment attorneys. Due to recent changes in
law, one Deputy Public Defender is needed to
advise non-citizen clients on the immigration
consequences of their cases. Another part-time
Deputy Public Defender and a part-time Legal
Assistant will implement Laura’s Law. Finally,
one additional Investigator position is needed to
relieve the workload for investigators who are
currently over capacity. The staffing
augmentation for FY 2015-16 acknowledges
increased caseloads and will facilitate new
programs and compliance requirements.

CAO’s Recommendation
The FY 2015-16 Baseline Budget reduces
expenditure appropriations by $0.4 million, or
0.2% and estimated revenue by $3.1 million, or
2.1%, resulting in an increase to net County cost
of $2,665,509.
The Recommended Budget includes a
$4,192,421 million increase in net County cost
over FY 2014-15 Budget. This amount funds the
entire Baseline Budget. The remainder is
allocated towards augmenting unincorporated
County Patrol operations with 10 FTE new
Deputy Sheriff positions.
The Recommended Budget maintains the
baseline vacancy factor of $4.2 million to
account for savings associated with positions
that are currently or will become vacant during
the year. We have advised the Sheriff to
continue to recruit aggressively in sworn
classifications in order to maximize staffing
within authorized levels. Should the Sheriff’s
Office not achieve the budgeted vacancy factor
due to favorable recruiting and retention of sworn
personnel, we will return to the Board later in the
fiscal year with a recommendation for a
budgetary augmentation.
Note: The County Administrator has developed
recommendations based on service level
impacts communicated by the Office of the
Sheriff-Coroner. It is acknowledged that the
Sheriff-Coroner is an elected official and has
ultimate discretion on how to best deploy
resources within his department using
appropriations allocated by the Board of
Supervisors.

CAO’s Recommendation
The Baseline expenditures were reduced from
the current year budget by $764,770 due
primarily to the elimination of a one-time
provision for outside attorney and witness fees
for capital cases. Court revenues are budgeted
conservatively, downward from the current year
budget by $368,405 based on of modest receipts
in the last 12 months.
The Recommended Budget is increased by
$128,000 over the Baseline to provide for the
one-time allocation approved by the Board of
Supervisors on February 3, 2015 to subsidize
the Superior Court’s first-year costs to implement
Laura’s Law, a court-ordered assisted outpatient
mental health treatment program. The Court
provided an estimated annual cost of $128,000
based on 1.5 FTE positions required to support
the anticipated workload associated with 37
cases as an extension of the current LPS court
calendar. (Lanterman Petris Short concerns the
involuntary civil commitment to a mental health
institution in the State of California.)
In better economic times, we have historically
budgeted in anticipation of three to five open
capital cases annually; however, we are
recommending a budget that anticipates only
one capital case for the new budget year. It
should be noted that Superior Court programs
are mandated and should the recommended
budget prove to be insufficient, mid-year
augmentations will need to be made from the
County’s reserves or through mid-year
reductions in other County programs.
The Recommended Budget includes
appropriations in the amount of $15.1 million for
transfer to the State to subsidize the cost of the
local Superior Court, and $1.8 million for court
functions for which the County is financially
responsible under the Trial Court Funding Act
and Public Safety Realignment (AB 109)*. The
General Fund subsidy to the courts for non-Rule
810 court operations includes judicial benefits for
current judges who were serving as judicial
officers in 1997, collection services, court
probation officer services, legal defense
representation in capital cases, and other courtappointed
counsel.
*Note that the Sheriff’s Department earns revenue in
consideration for providing bailiff and security services to
the Court. These costs and revenues are reported in the
County Local Revenue Fund and the Sheriff’s Department
budget.

CAO’s Recommendation
The FY 2015-16 Recommended Budget
provides for the funding of 24 fire stations and
335.6 FTEs. This includes 24 three-person
companies and three two-person squads. In
contrast, the FY 2014-15 Recommended Budget
funded 23 companies with no squads and a total
of 301.6 FTEs.
Prior to the start of FY 2014-15, the District
received a two-year federal staffing grant in the
amount of $9.6 million. This grant funds 27
firefighter positions. Additionally, in June 2014,
the voters in the City of San Pablo passed a
sales tax measure (Measure K) to enhance
emergency medical incident response. The
additional sources of revenue have allowed the
District to reopen a fire station in the City of
Clayton and staff fire stations in the cities of
Walnut Creek, Concord, and San Pablo with a
two-person squad in addition to the existing
three-person company.
The District is primarily funded by property tax
revenues. In FY 2014-15, the District
experienced a 9.6% growth in secured property
assessed valuation and 9.3% growth in total
assessed valuation. This represents the second
consecutive year of growth in assessed
valuation after several years of declines. The
District received additional property tax
distributions during the course of the fiscal year
due to the dissolution of various redevelopment
agencies in the County.
Despite this increase in revenue, the District will
need to use reserve funds to balance its FY
2014-15 budget because the growth in
expenditures outpaced the growth in revenue.
Employer retirement rates increased significantly
in FY 2014-15 due largely to the CCCERA
Board’s decision to decrease the investment
return assumption from 7.75% to 7.25%. The
District’s Safety Tier A rate increased from
47.3% in 2013-14 to 77.6% in 2014-15. In
addition to direct employer retirement costs, the
District is making payments on a 2005 issue of
pension obligation bonds through 2022.
In FY 2015-16 employer retirement contribution
rates will decrease for most employers and rate
groups. In FY 2014-15 the District settled a
contract with its largest labor group, IAFF Local
1230. The new contract provides for three, 2.5%
wage increases and eliminates the 9%
employee subvention of the employer cost
towards retirement, in three equal installments of
3%, over the course of the contract. The
reduction in employee subvention of employer
retirement costs offsets the general decline in
rates most other employers in CCCERA will
experience in FY 2015-16.
In FY 2014-15 the District appropriated $1
million to address some of its critical capital
needs and began implementation in March 2014
with an enterprise lease agreement to replace
light duty vehicles on a regular basis. In
December 2014, the District executed a lowinterest
lease purchase arrangement for the
replacement of several heavy fire apparatus.
The FY 2015-16 Recommended Budget
continues the $1 million appropriation to fund the
lease purchase payments associated with the
agreement described above and includes
appropriations for station repair projects and the
acquisition of additional heavy fire apparatus. It
also includes an appropriation for a fire boat,
increased appropriations for non-capital and
capital equipment, and appropriations for seven
support staff positions that were eliminated
during the economic recession.
The FY 2015-16 Recommended Budget
anticipates a 6% growth in secured property
assessed valuation and some new sources of

revenue, including the EMS first responder cost
recovery fee ($1.7 million) and Measure K
revenue from the City of San Pablo ($1.2
million).
The FY 2015-16 Recommended Budget
balances by using approximately $4.1 million in
fund balance. The District has a policy to
maintain a minimum reserve of 10% of operating
fund budgeted expenditures. Despite the
planned use of reserves to balance the budget,
the District continues to meet its reserve
requirements. It should also be noted that $2.6
million of the District’s planned expenditures are
for the transfer of funds from the general
operating fund to the pension obligation
stabilization fund. The pension obligation
stabilization fund can be used for very limited
purposes – such as extinguishing new
retirement UAALs and replenishing general fund
reserves.
The District is still recovering from a long and
deep recession, during which layoffs and
reductions in service occurred, employee takehome
pay declined due to wage and benefit
concessions, aging equipment was not replaced,
and infrastructure needs were not adequately
addressed. The 2015-16 Recommended Budget
attempts to address some of those needs while
still maintaining practical fiscal controls.
The County Administrator continues to work with
the District to monitor finances and operations
throughout the year and report to the Board
should there be a need to amend the
Recommended Budget.
