This budget is recommended at $2,565,961.
The General Fund provides 44% of the
financing for this budget unit and is
decreased by $189,378 (14.4%) compared to
FY 2012-13. Excluding the decrease in
Intrafund Plant Acquisition of $147,199
related to the Facility Expansion project, the
General Fund contribution has been reduced
by $42,179 (4.4%) compared to FY 2012-
13.
The salaries and related benefits increase in
the recommended budget is related to
increases in negotiated benefits, including a
countywide increase in Health Insurance
premium costs.
Facility Expansion Project
The FY 2011-12 budget included funding
for the expansion of the Agricultural
Commissioner’s portion of the building to
accommodate moving employees out of lab
space and housing them in the main facility.
The expansion will also improve conditions
for the over 9,000 members of the public
who visit the facility each year.
On December 6, 2011, the Board of
Supervisors awarded a contract to complete
the design of this expansion and evaluate
changes to the existing space that would
enhance workflow and improve
accommodations for the public.
On May 22, 2012, the Board of Supervisors
approved the use of $167,401 of
unanticipated Unclaimed Gas Tax revenue
from FY 2011-12 for costs associated with
the Facility Expansion project.
The FY 2012-13 Recommended Budget
included a re-budget of the uncompleted
portion of Phase I of the project at $365,599
for a total project cost of $533,000 with the
following funding sources:
 Use of Unclaimed Gas Tax revenue
of $167,401 in FY 2011-12 for preconstruction
costs;
 Use of $30,000 General Fund dollars
cancelled from reserves in FY 2011-
12; and
 Use of $335,599 in General
Government Development Impact
Fees (fund #0-101), a portion of
which will be replaced through
additional Unclaimed Gas Tax over
the next three years.
In May of 2013, the Board of Supervisors
approved the use of unanticipated
Unclaimed Gas Tax to purchase furnishings
for Phase I and to repay a portion of the
Impact Fees used in FY 2012-13.
Phase II of the project is the portion that will
enhance the workflow and move staff out of
lab space and into the main facility. The
estimated cost of this phase of the project is
$218,400.
The FY 2013-14 recommended budget
includes appropriations for this project in the
Plant Acquisition budget unit (#1-801), an
intrafund transfer of this cost to this budget
unit (#2-601), and the cancellation of
General Government Development Impact
Fees (fund #0-101). A portion of the
impact fees will be replaced through
additional Unclaimed Gas Tax over the next
three years.

The recommended budget includes an
increase in Unclaimed Gas Tax for FY
2013-14 which is related to the FY 2012-13
expansion project appropriations.
Per State statute, increased fees for Weights
and Measures enforcement have been
implemented.
This budget is recommended at $213,874. The
General Fund provides 63% of the financing
for this budget unit and is reduced $265 (0.2%)
compared to FY 2012-13.
The reduction of one clerical position
approved in the FY 2011-12 and FY 2012-13
budgets continues to impact the Department’s
ability to respond to clientele needs. The
office will continue to be closed to the public
from noon to 1:00 p.m. each day.
This budget is recommended at $1,228,992.
The General Fund provides 69% of the
financing for this budget and is reduced
$9,098 (1.1%) compared to FY 2012-13.
The recommended budget defunds one parttime
(0.5 FTE) Library Technician position,
which was left vacant after a retirement
earlier in FY 2012-13.
It has been determined that the reduction to
Extra Help in FY 2012-13 was not
sustainable. Therefore, an increase of
$23,020 in Extra Help is recommended to
better reflect the funding that is required to
cover approved employee leaves (sick leave
and vacation).
The recommended budget includes an
increase in Collection Development of
$13,000 to $45,000 which will be offset in
FY 2013-14 by cancelling funds from the
Development Impact Fees – Library budget
unit (#0-106), and shown as an Interfund
Transfer-In from that Special Revenue Fund.
The budget also reflects an increase in
Literacy funding from the California State
Library which unexpectedly received funds
last year, and is likely to be funded again in
FY 2013-14.
Literacy grants account for 24% of the total
library budget. The chart below shows the
line items and amounts that are funded by
the Literacy grant funds.
This budget is recommended at $176,973.
The general fund provides 89% of the
financing for this budget and is increased
$23,998 (18.1%) compared to FY 2012-13.
The recommended budget includes an
increase in Salaries & Benefits which is
related to increases in negotiated benefits,
including a countywide increase in Health
Insurance premium costs. It is also
increased slightly to correct a miscalculation
of estimated salaries during FY 2012-13
related to the reduction in employee hours.
The two County paid positions remain
funded at 80%. Staff report that the backlog
of curatorial work is growing. Staff
addresses day-to-day operations, which
takes a large portion of the day, leaving little
time to reduce the backlog.
Extra Help is recommended to be increased
by $405 to 475 hours, up from 450 hours in
FY 2012-13 (traditionally 700 hours). The
funding covers emergency and vacation
lunch hours plus Saturdays. The increase
will allow the reinstatement of four hours of
public hours on Sunday. The Museum
Commission provides the funding for Extra
Help.
Revenue from the rental of Ettl Hall was
estimated at $14,000 for FY 2012-13. It is
projected to be approximately $3,000 by the
end of this fiscal year. During the year, the
Board of Supervisors reduced the fee to rent
the hall and added a fee that includes the
patio. An advertising campaign to promote
the facility was initiated in FY 2012-13.
This has increased interest in the facility and
there are now several reservations in place
for rentals during FY 2013-14. The
Intrafund revenue shows as a negative
expense in the Museum budget and is
reduced to $6,455 to reflect the current
reservations in place for Ettl Hall. This
represents one-half of the actual rental
income less actual costs incurred for the
rentals. The General Fund covers any
unreimbursed costs from the Ettl Hall
budget.
Revenue from the Museum Commission is
recommended at $20,000, which is the same
as FY 2012-13, but increased from the
amount of funding provided in previous
years.
Additional reductions would require
reductions in personnel which would
compromise the ability for the department to
provide the required services and could
result in reduced hours of operation.
Therefore, no further reductions are
recommended at this time.
The County Administrative Office does not
make recommendations for funding in this
budget unit, as these funding decisions are
made solely at the discretion of the Board of
Supervisors. No amount has been budgeted
for the requested subsidies.
In FY 2012-13 a total of $17,000 was
appropriated for the following subsidy
organizations:
 Central Valley Homeless Veteran’s
Assistance Program: $1,000
 Friday Night Live: $1,000
 Sutter County Resource
Conservation District: $5,000
 The Acting Company: $5,000
 Yuba-Sutter Regional Arts
Council: $5,000
This budget is recommended at $91,552. The
General Fund provides 100% of the financing
for Sutter County’s share of the Veteran’s
Services Officer budget and remains relatively
unchanged compared to FY 2012-13.
This recommendation reflects only Sutter
County’s net share of cost.
This budget unit is based on a Bi-County
agreement and any additional reductions
would have to be negotiated with Yuba
County.

after offsetting Intrafund Administration
Service reimbursements are considered. The
budget is $1,038,055 prior to application of
intra-departmental reimbursements of
$553,285 from Development Services
General Fund Divisions. The General Fund
provides 36.5% of the financing for this
budget unit after Interfund revenues of
$249,300 are considered and is increased by
$368,883 compared to FY 2012-13.
The recommended budget includes the
transfer of administrative positions from the
former Public Works budget unit (1-920),
and the elimination of a filled
Administrative Services Officer position and
a vacant Hazardous Materials Specialist I/II
position from the former Community
Services Administration budget unit (2-721).
The ten positions currently reflected in this
budget unit are:
 Development Services Director –
new position (Community Services
Director was eliminated)
 Deputy Director Development
Services – Admin and Finance –
transferred from Public Works
budget unit (1-920)
 Accountant II – transferred from
Public Works budget unit (1-920)
 Accountant I – transferred from
Public Works budget unit (1-920)
 Accounting Technician II –
transferred from Public Works
budget unit (1-920)
 Accounting Technician I –
transferred from Public Works
budget unit (1-920)
 Executive Secretary II
 Office Assistant III – 2 FTEs
 Office Assistant II
The recommended budget reflects an
increase in salaries and benefits
commensurate with the consolidation of
positions from the former Community
Services and Public Works departments.
A share of the recommended increase is
spread to other budget units within the
Development Services Department as seen
in the Intrafund Administration Services, the
Interfund Admin – Road, the Interfund
Admin – Misc. Departments, and the
Contribution to Other Agency line items.

This budget is recommended at $319,720, and
includes Intrafund Administration Service
charges from the new Development Services
Administration budget unit (2-721). The
General Fund provides 18% of the financing
for this budget unit and is reduced by $59,480
(50.5%) compared to FY 2012-13.
The recommended budget reflects a 50%
reduction to the Emergency Services Manager
position, pursuant to the departmental
reorganization approved by the Board of
Supervisors in May of 2013. The
recommendation also includes an increase of
$11,773 due to the transfer of an additional
10% of the PIO position from the County
Administrative Office (1-102) reflecting time
spent by the PIO on Emergency Services
projects. This action was also approved in
May of 2013.

This budget is recommended at $795,705 after
offsetting Intrafund Administration Service
reimbursements are considered. The budget is
$870,503 prior to application of intradepartmental
reimbursements of $79,096.
The staffing for this budget unit has been
changed by eliminating the filled Public
Works Director, the filled Deputy Director for
General Services, the filled Senior
Engineering Tech, and the filled Executive
Secretary II positions. Three engineering
positions were moved to this budget unit from
the Road budget unit (3-100), and the Deputy
Director Admin and Finance and four
accounting positions were moved to the newly
created Development Services Administration
budget unit (2-721). The Assistant Director of
Development Services – Public Works has
been allocated 20% to this budget unit (1-
920), 60% to the Road budget unit (3-100)
and 20% to the Water Resources budget unit
(1-922)

This budget is recommended at $688,987,
and includes Intrafund Administration
Service charges from the new Development
Services Administration budget unit (2-721).
This budget unit does not receive any
funding from the General Fund. The net
cost of this budget unit is covered by permits
and an Interfund transfer from the Health
fund (1991 Realignment funding).
The recommended budget reflects a
decrease of 18.5% as compared to FY 2012-
13.
Intrafund Administration Services charges
are recommended at $161,802, which is
reduced by $38,198 over FY 2012-13.
These charges cover administration and
accounting services provided to the division.

This budget is recommended at $271,750
and includes Intrafund CUPA-EH charges
for services provided from the
Environmental Health Budget unit (2-725).
This budget unit does not receive any
funding from the General Fund. The net
cost of this budget unit is covered by permits
and grants.
Intrafund CUPA-EH, which represents the
charges for services provided by the
Environmental Health budget unit (2-725),
is budgeted at $244,709, which is a decrease
of $25,291 (9.4%) compared to FY 2012-13.
Revenues from Hazardous Materials Fees
are projected to increase by 28.6%
($46,931). However, State Grant funds are
projected to decrease 66% ($115,230) due to
the completion of a project using one-time
grant funds in FY 2012-13.

This budget is recommended at $259,047
and includes Intrafund Administration
Service charges from the new Development
Services Administration budget unit (2-721).
The General Fund provides 98% of the
financing for this budget unit and is reduced
by $23,028 (8.36%) compared to FY 2012-
13.

This budget is recommended at $2,826,107.
This budget unit does not receive any
funding from the General Fund. All funding
is provided through property taxes and
interest earnings.
The recommended budget includes funding
for the repair of the catastrophic failure of a
fire pump. The fire engine (fleet # 140) is a
1990 Mack, stationed at the Oswald-Tudor
Station. Because of the complete
destruction of the fire pump, the
manufacturer has to cast new pump housings
and then build the pump itself. There will
be an estimated two month down time for
this engine. Additionally, now is the time to
inspect and make repairs to the 2,000 gallon

water tank on this engine, since there was a
major repair to the water tank of a similar
fire engine last year. The pump and tank
repair/replacement will not exceed $40,000.
It is recommended that $65,000 be approved
to purchase a full-size fire equipped pickup
truck, to replace an aging passenger vehicle.
A portion of this cost is covered by
Emergency Services grant funding.
The recommended budget also includes the
financing and appropriations for equipment
to be purchased with the Assistance to
Firefighters grant as explained above. If the
grant is not approved, a separate plan for
replacement of the equipment over time will
be brought to the Board for approval.
This budget is recommended at $265,490.
This budget unit does not receive any
funding from the General Fund. All funding

is provided through property taxes and
interest.
The recommended budget includes the
financing and appropriations for equipment
to be purchased with the Assistance to
Firefighters grant as explained above. If the
grant is not approved, a separate plan for
replacement of the equipment over time will
be brought to the Board for approval.

This budget is recommended at $336,410.
This budget unit does not receive any
funding from the General Fund. All funding
is provided through property taxes and
interest earnings.
The recommended budget includes the
financing and appropriations for equipment
to be purchased with the Assistance to
Firefighters grant as explained above. If the
grant is not approved, a separate plan for
replacing the equipment over time will be
brought to the Board of Supervisors for
approval.
This budget is recommended at $4,054,942
and includes Intrafund Administration
Service charges from the new Development
Services Administration budget unit (2-721).

The General Fund provides 34% of the
financing for this budget unit and is reduced
by $34,148 (2.4%) compared to the
combined FY 2012-13 Planning and
Building Inspection budget units (2-724 &
2-722 respectively).
The recommended budget includes the
staffing changes outlined above and is
increased by $69,031 over the combined FY
2012-13 budget units.

This budget is recommended at $912,347.
Because reimbursement cannot be claimed
until the construction contract is awarded,
this budget reflects the transfer in of funds
from the County’s Criminal Justice
Development Impact Fee fund (0-102) to
cover any required local match and to
advance funds to complete the initial phases
of the project prior to receiving
reimbursement. The Criminal Justice
Development Impact Fee fund will be
reimbursed once State reimbursement
monies are received. The recommended
budget for this fund includes a cancellation
of Restricted Fund Balance in the amount of
$877,347 leaving an estimated ending
balance of $1,132,298.
This budget is recommended at $1,159,775.
The recommendation includes three projects
that were authorized in prior years and are
continuing in FY 2013-14, as well as nine
new projects for FY 2013-14.
It is recommended that immediate
authorization be given to the Development
Services Director to continue work on prior
year projects which are being re-budgeted
and to commence work on the new projects,
without waiting for the adoption of the final
budget resolution.

This budget is recommended at $6,722,191.
The Road budget unit currently does not
receive any funding support from the
General Fund.
Capital Assets are recommended at
$346,300 to purchase the following items:
 $230,000 for one Replacement
Motorized Road Grader to support the
increased unpaved road maintenance
program;
 $50,000 for one Replacement Trailer
Mounted Crack Sealer;
 $36,500 for one 1-Ton Dually Flat-Bed
Truck with 70/30 Dump to Replace
vehicle #640, a 1988 ? Ton Pickup with
138,000 miles; and

$29,800 for one ? Ton Truck to replace
vehicle #317, a 2002 ? Ton Pickup with
182,000 miles.
Because the construction season spans two
fiscal years, the recommended budget
includes funding and appropriations for the
carryover of selected construction projects
originally budgeted in the previous fiscal
year and may contain portions of the
previous fiscal year Road Plan.
The FY 2013-14 recommended budget
includes the following major projects:
 Design of the Pennington Road
Bridge ($35,000);
 Design initiation for Nicholas
Avenue (Coon Creek) and Larkin
Avenue (Butte Canal) Bridges
($284,000);
 Continuation of the Bridge
Preventative Maintenance Program
($106,000) which is funded in part
by the State; and
 Replacement of the Brewer Road
Culvert Crossing ($150,000).
A road seal and paving program is
programmed for the coming year
($929,491), as well as ADA compliance
improvements totaling $76,167. The Sutter
Avenue & California Street Bike Lanes
project is included for $441,000, as
described in the adopted FY 2013-14 Road
Plan (attached).
Interfund Public Works Administration
Service expense is recommended at
$658,431, which is an increase of $216,933
(11%) compared to FY 2012-13. The
administrative charges include engineering,
accounting and management staff time spent
in support of the Road Division.
Interfund Miscellaneous Non-Road revenues
are recommended at $134,567, an increase
of $33,817. The revenue reflects charges to
other budget units for administrative,
engineering, weed control, and maintenance
work performed by staff in the Road
Division.
The State Highway Users Tax
Apportionment (HUTA) revenues are based
on current market conditions. The revenues
from HUTA sections 2104, 2105 and 2106
fund most of the in-house road program, and
HUTA section 2103 is used to provide a
portion of the major maintenance and
rehabilitation programs in the Road Plan.
State and Federal highway program and
grant funds, when available, are also applied
to this endeavor.
Annually, the County receives a portion of
the Local Transportation Fund (LTF) under
the Transportation Development Act (TDA).
These funds are available for road work
after public transportation needs have been
met. Under an agreement with the Yuba–
Sutter Transportation Agency, an allocation
of funds is made to the County, which is
used for general road maintenance and
repairs. The annual amount available
depends on State revenues and is estimated
at $728,473 for FY 2013-14.
The County may also receive approximately
$278,000 in State funds under a subprogram
of RSTP; an exchange for Federal
funds. This is an annual amount provided to
counties and is being considered for
elimination by the State.

This budget unit is recommended at $150,000.
This budget unit does not receive any funding
from the General Fund. Funding of this
program comes from the County’s share of the
Local Transportation Fund (LTF) and is used
to fund unmet transit needs as required by
State law.

This budget is recommended at $76,050.
This budget unit does not receive financing
from the General Fund. The District
receives its funding from ad valorem
property taxes on properties within the
district.
Expenses are for utilities, repairs, and staff
administration. At this time, staff expenses
include efforts to incorporate lighting data
into the County’s Geographic Information
System (GIS).

This budget unit is recommended at $715,829
and includes Intrafund Administration Service
charges from the Development Services
Administration budget unit (2-721). The
General Fund provides 33% of the financing
for this budget unit and is decreased by
$17,380 (6.8%) compared to FY 2012-13.
The recommended budget includes the
addition of 20% of the Assistant Director
Development Services – Public Works
position as well as consultant costs for
engineering services related to floodplain
management and integrated water resource
management for the County.
Intrafund Administration services are
recommended at $102,137 which is a decrease
of $6,710 (6.1%) compared to FY 2012-13.
The administrative costs include accounting
and management staff’s time spent in support
of the Water Resources Division.
These budget units are recommended as
follows and include Interfund Public Works
Administration Service charges from the
Development Services Department budget
unit (2-721).
These budget units do not receive any funding
from the General Fund. All funding is
provided through tax assessments.
In FY 2013-14, the Water Resources Division,
which manages the Zones, is requesting to
fund ongoing drainage improvement planning
efforts based upon drainage studies of the Live
Oak Canal completed in FY 2010-11.

The FY 2013-14 Recommended Budget
includes 3 projects: Construction of a 1,300
foot drainage swale (Zone 4) in the amount of
$21,650, a second project in Zone 4 for
$58,316 for Madison Road erosion including
the construction of a low flow ditch and Zone
7’s ditch improvement project in the amount
of $16,674.
The Interfund Administration – Miscellaneous
Departments account is used to reflect charges
to the individual Zones for in-house
engineering services performed by the Water
Resources division. The FY 2013-14
Recommended Budget includes $1,130 (Zones
4 - 8) in this account related to work
performed for the Live Oak Canal
improvements.
Interfund Public Works Administration
Services are recommended at $8,193 (Zones
4-8) and include Development Services
accounting and management staff’s time spent
in support of the Sutter county Water Agency
Zones 4 through 8.
Assessments within the Zones of Benefit are
reviewed and adjusted as appropriate annually.

The FY 2013-14 budget for Waterworks
District No. 1 totals $695,193. The budget
reflects the total expenditures associated with
Operations & Maintenance, Capital Expense,
and Depreciation Expense.
The majority of the District’s expenses are
associated with maintenance and operations.
This category includes supplies and materials,
electricity, chemicals, professional services,
monitoring, state permits, repair and
maintenance expenses, staff expenses for the
operator and engineering support staff, and
other costs associated with operating the water
system. There are also administrative costs
incurred by the District, such as costs
associated with performing utility billing
services and accounting for the District.
The District is under a Compliance Order for
arsenic exceedance in the water service
program. In order to comply with the order,
the District needs to update the water
treatment plant. The FY 2012-13 budget that
was approved by the District’s Board of
Directors included expenses associated with a
arsenic remediation feasibility study
associated with the design of a new water
treatment plant that includes arsenic removal
technologies. Most major budget changes
reflect the ongoing staff efforts and receipt of
State grant income associated with this
feasibility study.
In 2009, monthly “interim fees” of $50.00 per
EDU (equivalent dwelling unit) for water
service and $55.00 per EDU for wastewater
service were adopted by the District’s Board
of Directors. In January 2013, a new
wastewater fee of $73.50 per EDU was
adopted in an effort to cover the actual
ongoing operations and maintenance costs
associated with operating the wastewater
services for the District. The new wastewater
fee goes into effect on July 1, 2013.
Budgeted operating revenues do not include
enough revenue to meet the non-cash
Depreciation Expense of $160,521.
Historically, the replacement costs for
infrastructure have been provided by State
grants.
Currently, the District is in the process of
procuring grant funding for a number of
wastewater collection and treatment
improvements, plus grant funding for the
installation of water meters. The District will
soon be applying for grant funding to
construct a new water treatment plant that
includes arsenic removal.
While the Wastewater Program expects
ongoing revenue to cover all ongoing
expenses, total revenues for the District are
not expected to cover all ongoing operations
and maintenance expenditures in FY 2013-14,
resulting in a projected deficit of $115,873 for
the fiscal year. This is in addition to prior

deficits, which were considered in February of
2011 when the Sutter County Board of
Supervisors approved an “interim” loan from
the General Fund to the District. The loan
was approved up to a maximum of $670,000
and for the period of 18 months. When
approved, it was anticipated that prior to the
end of the 18 month term of the loan, the
District would refinance the loan, request the
forgiveness of all or a portion of the loan, or
otherwise repay the loan. These options will
need to be considered by the District in the
coming fiscal year.

This budget is recommended at $2,188,829.
The General Fund provides 93% of the
financing for the Department. General Fund
cost is increased by $17,817 (0.9%)
compared to FY 2012-13.
Assessor staff voluntarily took a 5%
furlough during FY 2012-13. This furlough
will not be in effect for FY 2013-14. As
mentioned previously, ongoing salary
savings has been generated by the
Assessor’s decision to delete the Assessment
Technical Services Manager position and
replace it with the Assessment Office
Supervisor position.

This budget is recommended at $1,357,208.
The General Fund provides 99.8% of the
financing for this budget unit and is reduced
by $9,486 (0.7%) compared to FY 2012-13.
Extra Help funding is recommended at
$17,700.
 $8,200 is recommended to fund 550
hours of an Account Clerk I position
to perform data entry duties which
had been previously performed by
the Computer Operator in the
Information Technology
Department. This change was first
implemented in FY 2011-12.
 $9,500 is recommended to fund a
fulltime Accountant II position at
Step 5 for eight weeks.
The budget recommendation also includes
$6,900 for SunGard-related training and
travel for Auditor-Controller staff. Much of
these costs will be charged out to
departments and will eventually be
reimbursed through the A-87 cost plan.
For the 8th year in a row, the Auditor-
Controller has requested funding ($500,000)
for reimbursement of legal fees and for ongoing
legal representation. This amount has
not been included in the Recommended
Budget. The Board has repeatedly turned
down the Auditor’s request for
reimbursement of legal expenses ($460,000)
related to the defense of the Auditor-
Controller and Assistant Auditor-Controller
against their indictments. The remaining
$40,000 was intended for outside counsel to
respond to business-related legal questions
the Auditor may have.
The Auditor’s budget request also included
$8,000 for office furniture to relocate two
employee workstations within the office.
The request was removed as the workstation
purchase was completed in FY 2012-13 at a
cost of $5,500.

This budget is recommended at $178,620.
The General Fund provides 99.5% of the
financing for this budget unit and is reduced
by $10,131 (5.4%) compared to FY 2012-
13.
Salaries and related benefits have been
reduced by $10,019 for FY 2013-14. The
reduction is reflective of hiring the vacant
Board Clerk position at the Board Clerk I
level rather than the previous Board Clerk II
level, and transferring 20% of this position
to the County Administrative Office (CAO)
budget unit (1-102) to assist with office
duties.
The net reduction also includes the addition
of 20% of the Executive Assistant/Assistant
Clerk of the Board position. Traditionally,
this position has been budgeted 100% in the
CAO budget unit, while the position
performs oversight duties for the Clerk of
the Board positions. For FY 2013-14, it is
recommended that this position be reflected
as a shared position to more accurately
reflect the duties of this position distributed
between the two budget units.
Due to the limited size of the Clerk of the
Board budget, any reduction to the budget
would necessitate a reduction in staffing. A
reduction in staffing would inhibit the
County’s ability to meet legal requirements
regarding regular business and meetings of the
Board of Supervisors. Staff reductions in this
budget would also affect official recordkeeping
efforts. Therefore, reductions are not
recommended.

This budget unit is recommended at
$745,045. The General Fund provides 90%
of the financing for this budget unit and is
reduced by $15,335 (2.2%) compared to FY
2012-13.
Previous budgets have included funding for
smaller, less frequent landowner and utility
district (UDEL) elections. This budget does
not include funding for these elections. In
the event such an election is called, a budget
amendment requiring Board action would be
required. If one of these elections is called,
it would be reimbursed by the entity
requiring the election.
The only election budgeted for FY 2013-14
is the June Primary in 2014. A reduction in
the need for Extra Help staffing is
anticipated for this election and this line
item has therefore been reduced $4,650.
There is also a recommended decrease of
$8,000 in the Election Services line item to
reflect the streamlining of internal processes.
An increase in Candidate Filing fees is
budgeted, as well as an increase in the
transfer of funds from the Candidates
Statements Special Revenue Fund budget
unit (0-220), related to the June Primary
Election.
The recommended budget includes a $5 per
day increase in Election Day workers’ pay.
This pay has remained at $85 for the past 15
years. Qualified workers have become more
difficult to obtain and it is hoped this minor
increase in pay will help encourage more
citizens to assist in the election poll work.
Additional reductions to the Elections budget
would require the elimination of filled
positions. The County is mandated to cover
the cost of the Primary Election. Staff
reductions in the Elections Office would
hamper the office’s ability to meet legal
requirements and could compromise the ability
for the County to administer a legal election.
Therefore, further reductions are not
recommended at this time.

This budget is recommended at $469,393.
The General Fund provides 5.7% of the
financing for this budget unit and is reduced
by $706 (2.5%) compared to FY 2012-13.
Salaries and related benefits reflect a general
increase of $4,010 due to negotiated
benefits, including a countywide increase in
Health insurance premium costs.
The recommended decrease of $15,000 in
Computer Hardware is related to the
purchase of a replacement storage server in
FY 2012-13.
Recording Fee revenue for this budget unit
is anticipated to increase $55,000 based on a
recent increase in the number of recordings.
The increase in Recording Fee revenue is
recommended to be offset by a reduction of
$69,500 in the transfer-in of funds from the
Department’s various Special Revenue
Funds.
The recommended budget maintains one
frozen and unfunded Deputy Clerk-Recorder
position, which was defunded in FY 2011-
12. Reduced staffing decreases the
Department’s ability to perform special
project work that is eligible for
reimbursement from the Department’s
special revenue funds. Because recording
activity and service requests from members
of the public are addressed first and this
work has increased recently, the projects
funded by Special Revenue Fund
reimbursements, such as the truncation of
social security numbers from previously
recorded documents, will continue to be
performed as staff is available.
Additional reductions to the Recorder budget
unit would require the elimination of an
additional filled position, limiting the office’s
ability to meet legal requirements regarding
recording of documents and would
significantly compromise the Department’s
ability to provide services to the public.
Therefore, further reductions are not
recommended.

The increase in the County Clerk’s budget
for FY 2013-14 is primarily related to
general increases in negotiated benefits,
including a countywide increase in Health
Insurance premium costs.
The recommended budget maintains one
frozen and unfunded Deputy Clerk-Recorder
position, which was defunded in FY 2011-
12.
Additional reductions would require the
elimination of an additional filled position,
limiting the office’s ability to meet legal
requirements regarding recording of
documents and would significantly
compromise the Department’s ability to
provide services to the public. Therefore,
further reductions are not recommended.

This budget is recommended at $20,000, a
reduction of $1,000 based on recent data.
The General Fund does not provide any
financing for this budget unit.
It is recommended that a 10%
Administration fee, allowed by legislation,
be charged to cover the County cost to
administer this program. This fee will be
brought to the Board for consideration in FY
2013-14.

The budget is recommended at $1,040,007.
The General Fund provides 99.7% of the
financing for this budget unit, and is reduced
by $120,575 (10.4%) compared to FY 2012-
13. A portion of the costs for this budget
unit are recouped from the Local Agency
Formation Commission for staff support,
and through the annual A-87 cost plan.
The budget includes a recommendation to
eliminate the vacant Executive Secretary
position, in an effort to restructure the
workload of the County Administrative
Office and in light of reduced countywide
financing available. The Executive Secretary
position provided secretarial support for

executive management and office staff,
produced the final Recommended Budget
document, and assisted members of the
public and representatives from County
departments. The duties of the Executive
Secretary will be reassigned to remaining
staff, and will be partially offset by the
inclusion of 20% of a Board Clerk I position
in the CAO budget unit.
It is recommended that 20% of the
Executive Assistant/Assistant Clerk of the
Board position be transferred out of the
County Administrative Office budget unit
and reflected in the Clerk of the Board
budget unit (1-105) to more accurately
reflect the shared responsibilities and
supervision of that position.
Salary and benefit expenses have been
decreased due to the transfer of an additional
10% of the Public Information Officer (PIO)
position to the Emergency Services budget
unit (2-401) reflecting time spent by the PIO
on Emergency Services projects. The
Emergency Services budget will show an
increase of $11,773, which will be partially
offset with grant funding.
In May of 2013, the Board of Supervisors
approved a reorganization of County
departments, including the creation of a
stand-alone General Services Department.
One current Deputy County Administrative
Officer was appointed, effective July 1,
2013, as the Interim Director of this new
department, for a six-month period.
Therefore, salary and related benefits have
been reduced by $71,724 to reflect this sixmonth
temporary assignment.
The recommended budget eliminates the
Limited-Term Senior Analyst position that
was added in FY 2012-13 to assist the
department during the recruitment for a new
County Administrative Officer. That

position was never filled. The budget
maintains the regular Senior Analyst
position as vacant and unfunded. This
position was first left vacant and unfunded
in FY 2010-11.
On March 31, 2009, the Board of
Supervisors approved a contract with
SunGard Public Sector, Inc., to implement a
new software system for Personnel, Payroll,
Purchasing, and Budgeting. The
recommended budget includes a re-budget
of $30,000 for assistance with the
implementation of the Budget module,
which has been deferred for over two years
pending completion of the Personnel and
Payroll modules. This amount was allocated
as Extra Help funding in previous years.
Due to the limited size of the budget for the
County Administrative Office, additional
reductions would necessitate the elimination of
a filled position. This would be in addition to
the Executive Secretary position which is
slated for elimination in the Recommended
Budget and the Senior Analyst position that is
currently being held vacant and unfunded.
Further staff reductions would limit the
office’s ability to meet requirements of the
office, including legal requirements such as the
preparation of the annual Recommended
Budget and responses to Public Records Act
requests. Further reductions are not
recommended at this time.

This budget is recommended at $526,608.
The General Fund provides approximately
94.3% of the financing for this budget unit
and is decreased $60,329 (10.3%) compared
to FY 2012-13.
Audit Fees are recommended at $70,000 for
annual Independent Audit costs. This will be
the third year of a five-year contract.
It is recommended that $7,500 be added to the
annual budget to reinstate an annual employee
appreciation event. It is anticipated that the
event will be produced at minimal expense.
The Professional and Special Service – Legal
line item is recommended at $10,000 to cover
possible residual legal issues related to the
Golden State Water Company litigation. This
account has been decreased by $100,000 to
remove funds that were included in FY 2012-
13 for mediation/arbitration efforts with the
Auditor-Controller; those funds were not used
in FY 2012-13.

The Professional and Specialized Services
account is recommended at $121,000, to
include the transfer of the $10,000
Management Training program from the
Human Resources budget unit, addition of biannual
OPEB actuarial services which were
not required in FY 2012-13, and general
special contract services required in FY 2012-
13.
In an effort to reduce costs countywide, it is
recommended that the existing contract for
State level legislative advocacy be eliminated
in FY 2013-14. This results in a reduction of
$54,000.
The Contribution to Others account continues
to reflect the County’s contribution to the
Area 4 Agency on Aging (pursuant to a
current Joint Powers Agreement). This annual
payment was moved into the NDE budget unit
from the Subsidy Request budget unit (7-202)
in the FY 2011-12 Adopted Budget.
This year, it is also recommended that the
$52,000 annual contribution to the Yuba
Sutter Economic Development Corporation be
moved to the NDE budget unit from the
Subsidy Request budget unit (7-202).
The recommended budget transfers the $8,000
for Taxes & Assessments (SBFCA levee
assessments) to the Building Maintenance
budget unit (1-700).
Intrafund Transfers include a negative $5,000
(essentially a revenue) in Intrafund
Rents/Leases related to the Farm Advisor’s
building lease. This account is budgeted each
year.

The estimate for the General Revenue
category is $31,912,778, which is a decrease
of $440,599 (1.4%) compared to the FY 2012-
13 Adopted Budget.
The decrease is due to a reduction in the
amount of A-87 Overhead reimbursement
revenue that the General Fund receives from
non-General Fund departments (also referred
to as subvented funds) and outside agencies.
This reduction reflects reductions that have
been made over the past several years to
General Fund departments whose costs are
partially or wholly recouped through the A-87
Cost Plan. The annual A-87 Cost Plan is
produced by the Auditor-Controller’s Office
pursuant to Federal regulation. The General
Revenue category remains essentially the
same as FY 2012-13, when the reduction in
A-87 Overhead is not included.
The County's three major General Revenues
have traditionally been the property tax, the
sales tax, and the motor vehicle in-lieu
payments from the State. However,
significant changes occurred in FY 2004-05
regarding how two of these major revenue
streams, the sales tax and the motor vehicle
in-lieu (MVIL) payments, are received from
the State.
The voter approved Proposition 57 (The
Economic Recovery Bond Act, 2004),
implemented a set of transactions, also known
as the “Triple Flip,” whereby a share of
revenues that had previously appeared under
the Sales and Use Taxes account are now
shown in the related In-Lieu Local Sales and
Use Tax account. The amount that each
county receives for In-Lieu Local Sales and
Use Tax is provided each year by the State
Controller’s Office. This “temporary” shift of
revenues by the State is to last until all of the
revenue bonds issued by the State, pursuant to
Proposition 57, are paid off.
Prior to 2004, a primary source of revenue for
California counties was the motor vehicle inlieu.
Due to the voter approved Proposition
1A (Protection of Local Government
Revenues Act of November 2004), the State
now receives the motor vehicle in-lieu
revenues and have “swapped” that revenue for
property tax. That revenue is budgeted in the
Property Tax In-Lieu – Vehicle License Fee
account. The intent of Prop 1A was to protect
revenues collected by local governments
(cities, counties, and special districts) from
being transferred to the California state
government for statewide use. This is a
permanent change to the County-State
relationship regarding these revenues, and the
County will continue to receive Property Tax
revenues in lieu of MVIL. Property Tax In-
Lieu - Vehicle License Fee revenues are
calculated each year by a formula determined
by the State Controller’s Office. It should be
noted that these In-Lieu Property Tax
revenues are not related to, nor should they in
any way impact, the amount received in the
Property Tax – Secured account.
For FY 2013-14, property tax revenues
(including secured, unsecured, and property
tax in lieu of Motor Vehicle License Fees) are
projected to be approximately $21.51 million.
This represents a net increase of
approximately $426,800, or 2.0%, from the
FY 2012-13 Adopted Budget, based on the
initial property tax roll estimate. The County
Administrative Officer and the Assessor
estimate that property tax revenue will
increase for FY 2013-14 based on recent
market activity.

The budget for sales and use tax revenue is
recommended at $3.0 million. Sales tax based
revenues declined substantially in FY 2008-09
and FY 2009-10; however, the decline in sales
tax revenues appears to have leveled off
starting with FY 2011-12. The County
Administrative Office is projecting that
revenue from Sales and Use Tax will remain
the same as FY 2012-13. However, the
budget for In-Lieu Local Sales and Use Tax
has been increased by $150,000 to reflect
historic receipts in this category.
The County receives Franchise Fee revenue
from three sources: PG&E, Recology Yuba-
Sutter, and Comcast, with the majority of the
fee revenue coming from PG&E. Because the
PG&E franchise fee is tied to electric and gas
use, this revenue source fluctuates from year
to year. Total franchise fee revenue is
budgeted at $1.57 million, the same as FY
2012-13.
An Interfund Transfer-In from the General
Government Impact Fee Fund (0-101) has
been budgeted in the amount of $220,600.
This transfer is recommended to fund the
County’s share of cost of the recommended
Phase II of the expansion of the Agricultural
Commissioner’s offices at 142 Garden
Highway. This same funding strategy was
used in the prior year for Phase I of the
project. The project is discussed further in the
Agriculture Commissioner’s budget (2-601).
It is recommended that $67,000 of rebate
funds received from the Centers for Medicare
& Medicaid Services (CMS) Retiree Drug
Subsidy Program (RDS) be budgeted for FY
2012-13. The County began receiving these
funds in FY 2006-07, but had not budgeted
the revenue prior to FY 2012-13 due to the
volatility in the annual amount received. The
balance of the CMS/RDS funds in the amount
of $8,100 is budgeted in the Human Resources
budget unit (1-401) to offset the cost of retiree
billing services.
The estimated available Fund Balance from
FY 2012-13 is just over $4.4 million. This
represents carry-forward monies generated
from on-going County operations which can
be, and need to be, used to fund on-going
County expenditures.
It should be noted that the actual estimated
available Fund Balance will not be known
until the financial books of the County are
closed by the Auditor-Controller, typically in
October of each year, and it is likely that the
actual fund balance will differ from what is
included in this recommendation. At this
time, it is anticipated that any change in Fund
Balance available that results from the closing
of the County books at year-end will be
adjusted to the Increases in Obligated Fund
Balance account, to be placed in Obligated
Fund Balance Designated for Capital Projects
in the final Adopted Budget.

This budget is recommended at $1,339,122.
The General Fund provides 97.3% of the
financing for this budget unit and is
increased by $31,639 (3.0%) compared to
FY 2012-13 once the $200,000 one-time
expense for legal services is discounted. A
portion of the costs for this budget unit are
recouped from outside and subvented funds
through the annual A-87 cost plan.
The Board of Supervisors approved a minor,
temporary reorganization of the Department
in February of 2012, due to an extended
vacancy in the Assistant County Counsel
position related to a long-term medical
leave. An existing Deputy County Counsel
IV has since been promoted to the vacated
Assistant County Counsel position, and the
vacated Deputy County Counsel IV position
has been filled, at the Deputy County
Counsel I level, by an existing employee
that has held a Limited Term Deputy County
Counsel I position. Therefore, it is
recommended that the Limited Term Deputy
County Counsel I position be eliminated.
There is no cost increase or decrease
associated with these actions.
The recommended budget includes
$200,000 for one-time outside legal services

related to anticipated, pending and/or
existing litigation against the County.
Funding will only be used if pending or
existing litigation requires the use of outside
counsel services. It is recommended that
this one-time cost be offset with one-time
monies through a cancellation of Obligated
Fund Balance in the General Revenues
budget unit (1-209).
The remaining increase in the County
Counsel budget for FY 2013-14 is related to
increases in negotiated benefits, including a
countywide increase in Health Insurance
premium costs.
The recommended budget maintains major
prior year reductions in the following
accounts:
 Subscriptions and Publications,
maintained at $28,000. Law Research
contracts and subscriptions were
reduced in the prior two years. The
Department maintains only one legal
resource subscription, and is using
internet-based research to the extent
possible.
 Professional and Specialized Services,
maintained at $6,000. Additional
appropriations will be required for
outside counsel in the event that larger
cases arise which would exceed the
capacity of the Department.
 Transportation and Travel, maintained
at $6,000. The Department must keep
a minimum appropriation for
Transportation and Travel for
professional staff to attend trainings
where they receive continuing
education credits, as this is the most
economical means to meet licensing
requirements.
The impact of these reductions will continue
to be monitored.
The County Counsel Department is
relatively small, staffed by the County
Counsel, an Assistant County Counsel and
three Deputy County Counsels, plus one
full-time Administrative Assistant and one
part-time Legal Secretary. Further budget
reductions in the County Counsel
Department would, depending on the desired
reduction amount, require the reduction of at
least one professional position and would
result in a commensurate reduction in legal
services available to the Board of
Supervisors and County departments.
Therefore, no further reductions are
recommended in this budget unit.

This budget is recommended at $926,381.
The General Fund provides 97.6% of the
financing for this budget unit and is
increased by approximately $20,900 (2.4%)
compared to FY 2012-13. A portion of the
costs for this budget unit are recouped from
outside and subvented funds through the
annual A-87 cost plan.
It is recommended that the Extra Help
budget remain defunded for FY 2013-14.
The Department is closed to the public
during the noon hour (from 12:30 p.m. to
1:30 p.m.) due to the loss of extra-help front
desk assistance in FY 2012-13.
Funding is recommended in the
Professional/Specialized Services account to
reflect the need for an Integrated Disability
Management Program and a consultant to
conduct a Workforce Analysis. The
Department experienced an increased need
for outside investigative services related to
employee relations issues. The Department
anticipates that this trend will continue, and
that those departments for whom the
investigations are being conducted be
required to fund the cost of the outside
investigator.
The Employment Training account has been
reduced by $10,000 reflecting the transfer of
the appropriation for the countywide
training expenses to the Non-Departmental
Expenses budget unit (1-103).
Additional reductions to the Human
Resources Department would require the
elimination of a filled position, limiting the
office’s ability to provide adequate services
to internal County department customers,
employees and members of the public. Staff
reductions would also impede the
Department’s ability to meet legal
requirements regarding compliance with
employment laws. Because certain legal
requirements may not be eliminated, a
significant staffing shortage could require
the County contract for those services from
outside vendors, which would offset any
intended cost savings. Therefore, further
reductions are not recommended.

This budget is recommended at $794,746.
The General Fund provides 68.5% of the
financing for this budget unit (effective with
FY 2013-14) and is increased by $309,307
(131%) compared to FY 2012-13.
The recommended budget reflects a
decrease of $399,165 in salaries and related
benefits. Once transitioned to the City of
Yuba City, shelter and field services will be
staffed with a combination of Yuba City
employees and contracted Sutter County
employees. The recommended budget
reflects only those employees currently
included in the agreement with the City of
Yuba City for employee services, plus one
additional employee not included in the
contract due to an extended leave of
absence. The number of contracted
employees will be reduced each time a
Sutter County employee leaves service for
any reason and the position changes to a
Yuba City position. The contracted
employee costs are offset with matching
revenue from Yuba City.
Yuba City will provide Workers’
Compensation benefits for all employees
including the employees contracted from
Sutter County. Because Workers’
Compensation costs are allocated to all
Sutter County departments utilizing a
formula that includes a 10-year experience
factor, there is a residual cost for the
coverage provided by Sutter County as lead
agency. This residual cost ($83,963 for FY
2013-14) will be borne by Sutter County
alone and is reflected in this recommended
budget. This residual amount will decrease
each year for 10 years and will eventually
reach zero.
All other line items in this budget unit have
been reduced to zero with the exception of:
 A one-time $1,221 residual charge
for Interfund Insurance ISF
premium.
 A one-time $247 residual charge for
Intrafund General Insurance/Bonds
premium.
 The addition of $237,534
Contribution to Other Agencies to
reflect Sutter County’s 25% share of
the approved SASA budget (which
could change based on the allocation
methodology adopted by June of
2014).
 The residual Intrafund Overhead (A-
87) Cost of $138,606, not shared by
the SASA jurisdictions. This item
was removed from the shared SASA
budget in FY 2011-12 and will
reduce to zero during FY 2015-16,
two years after the transfer of lead
agency duties.

The Yuba City Animal Control
revenue line item, $249,271, which
reflects the actual cost of employees
contracted to Yuba City.
The General Fund cost for this budget unit
will reduce each year to reflect the reduction
of residual costs and any changes that may
occur to the agreement for employee
services with the City of Yuba City. At
some time in the future, this budget unit will
reflect only Sutter County’s proportionate
share of the approved SASA budget.

This budget is recommended at $741,198.
The Liability Insurance budget unit operates
as an ISF and must balance revenues to
expenditures within the fund.
Recommended budget increases result in a
$37,938 (17.8%) increase in the Interfund
Liability Insurance ISF premium charges to
County Departments as compared to FY
2012-13. The amount, budgeted in the
Interfund Liability Insurance ISF line item,
reflects the total charges made to County
departments for liability insurance premiums
and requirements to maintain the liability
claims reserve. Therefore, the increase in
this account equals the amount that has been
increased in County department budgets for
FY 2013-14.
The Board of Supervisors has a funding
policy that program assets be maintained
between the 75% and 90% confidence level.
The assets of the program are projected to be
in excess of the 90% confidence level at
June 30, 2013. Over time, the Liability ISF
had generated a funding surplus. Therefore,
the actuarial valuation recommended the
County implement a funding plan to bring
program assets back to the desired
confidence level by June 30, 2015.
The CSAC Excess Insurance Authority
standard states that based on the actuarial
recommendations, the members should
maintain reserves and make funding
contributions equal to or exceeding the
expected losses and a reasonable margin for
contingencies. The recommended amount to
be set aside in FY 2013-14 for future claims
payable is $200,000. With this
recommendation, the County will continue
to have sufficient funds set aside in the
liability claims reserve to cover future
claims payable.

This budget is recommended at $2,225,852.
Because the net costs of this fund are
allocated to all County departments,
including General Fund departments, a
significant effort has been made to contain
costs in the Workers’ Compensation Fund.
The recommended budget includes an
increase of $22,314 in salaries and related
benefits due to increases in negotiated
benefits, including a countywide increase in
Health Insurance premium costs. As
mentioned above, the effort to contain
current year costs is reflected in the
recommendation to hold the Safety
Coordinator position at a 60% position (0.6
FTE) for a third year, with the Risk Manager
assuming safety-related administrative
duties that have traditionally been performed
by the Safety Coordinator. These duties
include: developing safety communication
materials and disseminating to departments;
training employees in safety policies;
investigating work place accidents and
developing corresponding accident reports;
providing consultation services to
departments to assist them in developing an
effective injury and illness prevention

program; interacting with governmental
agencies to secure and provide information
to departments; responding to Cal/OSHA
inspections and citations and represent
County at administrative hearings related to
citations. However, it should be noted that
the continuing reduction of the Safety
Coordinator hours and corresponding shift
of responsibility to the Risk Manager is not
conducive to the Division’s stated efforts to
contain costs by managing the risks.
Over 80% of the cost of the County’s
Workers’ Compensation program is driven
by insurance premium costs. Initial
insurance premium estimates received from
the carrier indicate an increase over the prior
year budgeted amount driven primarily by
escalating workers’ compensation insurance
rates from the underwriting markets.
However, the County was recently notified
that it will receive a dividend from the
carrier based on pooled savings, which will
be applied in the coming year. Therefore,
the recommendation for the FY 2013-14
insurance premium reflects this dividend as
a reduction to insurance costs.
Additional reductions to the Workers’
Compensation budget are not recommended.
An additional reduction would require the
elimination of the Safety Coordinator
position. Complete elimination of the
Safety Coordinator position would place the
County’s safety program at risk, as all duties
currently performed by the Safety
Coordinator would be, by default,
transferred to the Risk Manager. Regular
activities such as safety inspections and
trainings would be either severely limited or
eliminated altogether, depending upon other
critical priorities that arise during the year
for the Risk Manager. Elimination of the
safety program could in turn negatively
impact the County’s claims experience and
cause an increase in premiums. Further
reductions are not recommended at this
time.
This budget is recommended at $951,379.
The General Fund provides 60% of the
financing for the Department. General Fund
cost is reduced by $17,141 (2.9%) compared
to FY 2012-13.
This recommendation reflects the continued
decision to hold vacant and unfunded one
Treasurer-Deputy Collector position that
was initially frozen and unfunded in FY
2009-10 and maintains the reduction of one
Treasurer-Collector Deputy position to halftime
(0.5 FTE) originally reduced in FY
2011-12.
Additional reductions to the Treasurer-Tax
Collector budget are not recommended; as
further reductions would require the
elimination of filled positions, limiting the
office’s ability to meet customer service
requirements and expectations.

This budget is recommended at $214,015.
The General Fund provides 53% of the
financing for the Department, which has
increased by $6,787 (6.4%) compared to FY
2012-13. The increased General Fund cost
is primarily due to an anticipated reduction
in revenue.
The Office of Revenue Collections division
is staffed by two full-time Treasurer-
Collector Deputy positions and is allocated a
portion of the Assistant Treasurer-Tax
Collector position for management
oversight. The Department will continue to
hold vacant and unfunded a third Treasurer-
Collector Deputy position that was
originally frozen and unfunded in FY 2010-
11.
The FY 2012-13 Adopted Budget position
allocation shows 2.0 allocated Treasurer-
Collector Deputy positions instead of the
proper number of 3.0 positions. The FY
2013-14 Recommended Budget shows the
correct number, 3.0 positions, one of which
is the vacant and unfunded position
mentioned previously. This appears as an
increase in the position allocations, but is
simply correcting the missing position
allocation in the FY 2012-13 Budget.
This budget is recommended at $682,227.
The General Fund provides 16% of the
financing for this budget unit after
administrative services revenue has been
collected, and is decreased $192,745
(64.2%) when compared to the combined
total of the FY 2012-13 Purchasing and
Central Services budget units. A portion of
the costs for this budget are recouped from
outside and subvented funds through the
annual A-87 cost plan.
As noted, this budget unit reflects
Intra/Interfund Administration Service
revenues, which represent the provision of
administrative support service to the other
budget units in this Department. These
services were previously provided by the
Public Works budget unit (1-920) and
allocated and billed in the same manner.
The recommended budget includes the
addition of three positions (one new position
and two transferred positions) for a total of
six positions, as discussed above. Intrafund
Administration Services revenue is shown as
a negative expense, and is recommended at
($197,759), which is a decrease of $259,059
compared to FY 2012-13, and reflects
revenues from the remaining General Fund
budget units in this Department to cover
administrative services provided. Similarly,
the addition of Interfund Admin-Misc.
Department revenue in the amount of
$262,146 reflects the administrative services
provided by this budget unit to the
Information Technology ISF, the Fleet ISF,
and the Airport budget units.

This budget is recommended at $269,974
and includes Intrafund Administration
Services charges from the General Services
Admin budget unit (1-205). The General
Fund provides 90% of the financing for this
budget unit and is increased $36,057
(17.4%) compared to FY 2012-13.
The recommended budget includes
$196,834 in Intrafund A-87 Cost Plan
Building Maintenance charges, which is an
increase of $37,015 (23%) compared to FY
2012-13. The Cost Plan is developed each
year by the Auditor-Controller’s office and
reflects Building Maintenance charges based
on actual costs from FY 2011-12.
The recommendation includes an increase in
boat launch fee revenue reflecting a full year

This budget is recommended at $3,009,995,
and includes Intrafund Administration
Service charges from the General Services
Administration budget unit (1-205). The
General Fund provides 84.9% of the
financing for this budget unit and is
increased by $69,113 (2.8%) compared to
FY 2012-13. A portion of the costs for this
budget unit are recouped from outside and
sub-vented funds through the annual A-87
cost plan.

Professional and Specialized Services are
recommended to include only known
recurring contract work such as elevator
maintenance, fire extinguisher maintenance,
pest control services and card access system
repairs and monitoring. No contingency
funds are budgeted for unanticipated work.
Additional funding would be requested if
additional services are required.
Maintenance of Structure & Improvements
is recommended at $40,000 to cover only
those planned maintenance projects under
$15,000 in cost with little funding provided
for unanticipated projects.

This budget is recommended at $520,524,
and includes Interfund Administrative
Service charges from the General Services
Admin budget unit (1-205). The General
Fund does not generally provide any funding
for this budget unit; however, a General
Fund loan, not to exceed $185,000, was
granted in FY 2010-11 to fund on-going
operations. Only a portion of that loan has
been utilized to date.
In FY 2013-14, $28,150 of the loan balance
will be paid back to the cash balance,
leaving an estimated balance of $130,638 of
available loan proceeds from the original
$185,000 loan.
The SBRAA’s proposed budget for
management of the airport includes proceeds
to pay back the General Fund loan over
time.
The FY 2013-14 Recommended Budget
includes $194,560 in charges for the paving
and shouldering of the taxiway and a
Precision Approach Path Indicator (PAPI)
for the runway. Approximately $179,550
(92%) of these costs will be covered by
grants from the FAA and the State.
Interfund Admin – Misc. Departments
revenue is recommended at $18,390, which
is a decrease of $33,775 (65%) compared to
FY 2012-13. The administrative costs
include General Services accounting and
management time spent in support of the
Airport.
The FY 2013-14 Recommended Budget
includes $43,592 in Interfund Overhead A-
87 Cost Plan charges, a decrease of $51,892
(55%) over FY 2012-13. The Cost Plan is
developed each year by the Auditor-
Controller’s office and reflects county-wide
overhead charges based on actual costs from
FY 2011-12.

This budget is recommended at $21,430.
This budget unit does not receive any
funding from the General Fund. All funding
is provided through fines and interest.
The Special Department Expense reflects
expenses related to programs, events and
donations such as:
 Pheasants
 Support of duck egg projects;
 Yuba Sutter Fair booth
 Donations of equipment to the Game
Wardens; and
 Donations to support special events,
programs and projects.
The Youth Programs account reflects
expenses specifically tied to youth
educational programs, events and donations
such as:
 Youth fishing derbies;
 Salmon aquarium programs;
 School educational programs and
field trips; and
 Shady Creek Outdoor School
scholarships.

This budget is recommended at $1,479,197,
and includes Interfund Administration
Services charges from the General Services
Administration budget unit (1-205).
The Fleet Management budget unit operates
as an ISF and must balance revenue to
expenditure within the fund.
Compared to FY 2012-13, the recommended
budget reflects a $117,687 (8%) net
decrease in the three Interfund revenue
accounts used to charge County customers
for services provided: Interfund Fuel & Oil,
Interfund Vehicle Maintenance, and
Interfund Fleet Administration.
Due to the volatility in the price of fuel, it is
difficult to accurately estimate the future
cost of fuel. Based on higher fuel prices,
offset by reduced fuel use across
departments, the recommended budget for
FY 2013-14 includes $510,000 for the
purchase of fuel for the majority of County
departments. This represents a 1% increase
in this budget item compared to FY 2012-
13. Additional funding may be required if
major prolonged upward fluctuations in fuel
prices are experienced.
The recommended budget includes $16,500
for the purchase of capital assets: $8,000 to
provide cooling fans for the mechanics work
areas on the shop floor, and $8,500 to
replace a 23-year-old brake lathe that has
exceeded its service life.

This budget is recommended at $3,940,394.
The Information Technology budget unit
operates as an ISF and must balance
revenues to expenditures within the fund.
The recommended budget results in a
$104,662 (3%) decrease in the Interfund
Information Technology charges to County
departments as compared to FY 2012-13.
The Interfund Information Technology
account represents the total of all charges
made to County departments for Information
Technology services. Therefore, the
reduction of $104,662 equals the amount
that has been reduced in County Department
budgets for FY 2013-14.
One vacant Computer Operator position was
also defunded in FY 2010-11. It is
recommended that this position be reinstated
and funded as an 80% position. This
reinstatement of this position will allow
other staff members who have been covering
for the loss of this position for the past three
years to perform the higher level functions
that are needed in the Department and by the
County. The budget has been increased by
$61,654 for this part-time position.
In FY 2011-12, as part of cost saving
measures, the Department recommended the
elimination of Unrestricted Stand-by Pay,
which was partially offset by an increase in
regular Overtime. As a result, on-call and
after-hours support for the County became
the sole responsibility of the Director, which
was a management position and therefore
not compensated for being on stand-by. It is
recommended that Unrestricted Stand-by
Pay be reinstated, although not at the
previous level. Therefore, $8,000 has been
added to the budget to allow management to
assign Unrestricted Stand-by on weekends
County of

and evenings to non-exempt employees
within the Department.
The Department eliminated funding for
virtually all travel, training, subscriptions
and other methods of maintaining a welltrained
staff in FY 2011-12. This reduction
is continued in FY 2012-13. While such a
reduction is possible for a short period of
time, it is not recommended that staff
training be eliminated long term. Limiting
staff training indefinitely can negatively
impact the County’s ability to consider and
implement new systems, which historically
are methods by which long term cost
savings, system wide process improvements
and efficiencies are achieved across
organizations. Therefore, $6,000 has been
added to the budget to begin allowing
minimal training to staff is select areas of
the Department.
It is recommended that the County’s AS400
be replaced in FY 2013-14, and $45,000 has
been included as a Capital Asset purchase.
The purchase of a new AS400 comes with
three years of free service; whereas annual
service on the existing AS400 would be in
excess of $45,000 per year. It is
recommended that the Board authorize the
purchase of this Capital Asset effective July
1, 2013, in advance of the adoption of the
final Budget.
The current AS400 was purchased in 2006.
The AS400 is one of the largest single
pieces of equipment in the County
Information Technology infrastructure.
Following is a sampling of some of the
primary applications and departments that
use the AS400: Sungard Public Safety &
Justice (Sheriff, District Attorney,
Probation); Property Tax System, Secured,
Unsecured and Supplemental Tax Rolls and
Bills (Assessor, Treasurer-Tax Collector,
Auditor-Controller); County Budget
Development System (County
Administrative Office); Patient Care
Management (Health Department); Mental
Health System, Patient Billing Research
(Mental Health Department).
It should be noted that the HR/Payroll
System is currently housed on the AS400,
and is anticipated to be off of the AS400 as
of July 1, 2013 with the implementation of
the new Sungard HR/Payroll system. That
new system will be run from a dedicated
server.
The A-87 Cost Plan is provided by the
Auditor-Controller’s office each year. For
FY 2012-13, the Information Technology
Division’s Interfund Overhead (A-87)
charges are recommended at $70,555 which
is a reduction of $61,818 (47%) compared to
FY 2012-13.

This budget is recommended at $39,273, and
includes Intrafund Administration Services
charges from the General Services Admin
budget unit (1-205). The General Fund
provides 61.8% of the financing for this
budget unit and is increased $24,273
compared to FY 2012-13.
The recommended budget includes $15,716
in Intrafund A-87 Cost Plan Building
Maintenance charges, an increase of
$13,716. The Cost Plan is developed each
year by the Auditor-Controller’s office and
reflects Building Maintenance charges based
on actual costs from FY 2011-12 the first
year of operations for the Hall.
The recommended budget also includes
estimated rental revenues of $15,000, a
reduction from $30,000 in FY 2012-13, to
more closely reflect the actual rentals
already reserved for FY 2013-14. The
Community Memorial Museum budget unit
(7-201) is estimated to receive $6,455
through the Intrafund Museum Rental
Revenue account, which represents one-half
of the net rental revenue (less rental
expenses). The remaining one-half of the
net rental revenue is returned to the General
Fund to cover the General Fund loan made
to construct the facility.

This budget is recommended at $433,981,
which is an increase of $7,821 (1.8%)
compared to FY 2012-13.
The $69,214 unreimbursed cost, which is
decreased by $674 (1.0%) over FY 2012-13,
represents the Health Department's share of
the Human Services-Administration budget.
This Unreimbursed Cost is, in concept,
partially funded by the General Fund
through the General Fund’s contribution to
the Health Fund.
One Plant Acquisition project is
recommended to remodel County-owned
space within the Health Facility in order to
move one Human Services employee out of
rented office space. Once this project is
complete, the three remaining Human
Services staff will be co-located within the
Health Facility.
It is recommended that the vacant and
unfunded Administrative Services Manager
position be eliminated from the position
allocation schedule. There is no budget
reduction associated with this
recommendation, as the position has been
unfunded.

This budget is recommended at $5,912,235
with a net unreimbursed cost of $2,803,680,
which is a decrease of $92,695 (3.2%)
compared to FY 2012-13. The majority of this
cost is offset by 1991 Realignment revenue.
The County has a Maintenance of Effort
(MOE), or minimum funding requirement, as a
condition of receiving 1991 Realignment
funding from the State. Sutter County’s MOE
is $674,240. The recommended budget overmatches
the MOE by approximately $44,000,
which is a reduction of $115,140 (72%)
compared to the FY 2012-13 Adopted Budget.
In prior years, a full-time (1.0 FTE) Nurse
Practitioner position and a half-time (0.5 FTE)
Licensed Vocational Nurse position were
contracted to PeachTree Clinic. The clinic
notified the County in FY 2012-13 that those
positions were no longer needed. The Nurse
Practitioner position is currently vacant. In
addition, a Nutritional Assistant position is
vacant and not filled due to a decrease in
caseload. The budget reflects the elimination
of these vacant positions and the
corresponding revenue loss.
Funding for one vacant Public Health Nurse II
/ Social Services Worker III position has been
removed from the budget recommendation,
pending approval of funding in revised Medi-
Cal Administrative Activities (MAA) program
plan. It is anticipated that the Department will
request the position be refunded with approval
of the revised MAA plan.
Additionally, 10% of the Health Officer
position and 60% of one Office Assistant II
position have been removed from this budget
unit and included in the Jail Medical Services
budget unit (4-134) to more accurately reflect
time spent.
Of the remaining 54.68 FTE positions
contained in the Health Department budget,
30.19 FTE positions are directly grant funded.

This budget is recommended at $2,145,903,
which is an increase of $60,190 (2.9%)
compared to FY 2012-13. Jail Medical
Services are 100% funded by the General
Fund.
Support & Care of Persons expense reflects

direct expenditures related to the
hospitalizations and other outside care of
inmates. This line item is recommended at
$530,000. There is no recommended change
from the prior year. However, in FY 2012-13
this reflected an increase of $210,000, or 65%,
over the FY 2011-12 Adopted Budget. These
expenditures will be monitored closely over
the coming year.
The cost of providing medical services to the
Sutter County Jail is, in effect, transferred to
the Jail budget unit (2-301), within the Public
Safety fund (0015), through the recording of
an Interfund Jail Medical transfer. This
transfer essentially transfers the unreimbursed
cost of the Jail Medical Services program from
the Health Fund to the Public Safety fund. The
General Fund covers all unreimbursed costs in
the Public Safety fund.

This budget is recommended at $647,876, with
a net unreimbursed cost of $624,158, which is
a decrease of $153,089 (19.7%) compared to
FY 2012-13.
The County is currently in a multi-year
contract with Bi-County Ambulance Services
for indigent medical transportation. The
annual cost for these services is $26,400. This
is considered a General Fund cost.
The County Share in the EMS Agency is
recommended at $52,750. The anticipated
cost for participation in this joint powers
agreement is based on California State
Department of Finance projections for the
population of Sutter County. This cost is
partially offset with a transfer in from the

Emergency Medical Services Special Revenue
Fund (0-252), in the amount of $23,718.
This budget contains the participation fee
($188,781) set by legislation for the County to
participate in the CMSP. This is considered a
General Fund cost.
The budget also includes $379,945 to be
transferred to the Environmental Health budget
unit. The recommended amount represents a
reduction of $153,089 over the FY 2012-13
Adopted Budget due to reductions in the
Development Services Department and the
Environmental Health Division budget.

This budget is recommended at $280,848,
which is an increase of $5,980 (2.2%)
compared to FY 2012-13. This budget unit
receives a portion of its financing from the
General Fund, with the balance of the
County’s share of cost met by a transfer in of
Welfare/Social Services 1991 Realignment
funding.
At this time, the State has not determined the
amount of its contribution to the Sutter
County CCS Program in FY 2013-14. As
mentioned above, in the past, as a policy item,
the County has budgeted an amount in excess
of the MOE in order to meet the potential
demand for service, which can be very
volatile. This budget request for $210,368 is
consistent with the Board of Supervisors’ past
policy in this area and is the same as the prior
year’s Adopted Budget. However, the Board
could opt to reduce this budget request to the
minimum MOE of $154,465, to match a
potential reduced State contribution. At this
time it is unknown whether State contribution
will match the amount appropriated over the
MOE.

This budget is recommended at
$24,995,381, which is an increase of
$890,433 (3.7%) compared to FY 2012-13.
The increase is primarily due to ongoing
implementation of 2011 Realignment. This
budget unit receives no financing from the
County General Fund. The sources of
funding for Sutter-Yuba Mental Health
Services are shown in Figure 1. Mental
Health’s funding history is shown graphically
in Figure 2.
For FY 2013-14, the Recommended Budget
includes restoration of funding for one
Intervention Counselor position that was
previously frozen and addition of a 0.25
FTE Mental Health Therapist I/II/III
position transferred from the Mental Health
Services Act Budget (4-104) with both
actions effective July 1, 2013. It is also
recommended that all Office Assistant I (1
FTE) and Office Assistant II (5 FTEs)
positions be reallocated as flexibly staffed
Office Assistant I/II positions to give the
Department flexibility in hiring decisions.
Each of these positions would remain funded
at their current level.
It remains SYMHS’ objective to keep the
Mental Health budget and the Mental Health
Services Act budget in balance and to fully
utilize all available funding in a fashion
most advantageous to our counties. Accordingly,
a thorough review was conducted of
positions associated with MHSA-funded
Prevention and Early Intervention (PEI) programs.
As a result, funding for a number of
positions needs to be adjusted in both
Mental Health budget units and it is
recommended that these changes be
approved. The net impact of these
adjustments on this Mental Health Services
budget is +0.05 FTE and the net impact on
the MHSA budget is -0.05 FTE.

This budget is recommended at $9,635,971,
which is an increase of $1,084,733 (12.7%)
compared to FY 2012-13. This increase is
primarily due to the ongoing EHR project
expenses and implementation of the WET
and Innovation components of MHSA.
These expenses are funded by revenue from
the State and from the federal share of
reimbursement for services claimed to
Medi-Cal. This budget unit receives no
financing from the General Fund. See
Figures 1 and 2 in the Mental Health (4-102)
budget narrative for information on Mental
Health funding sources and history.
During the economic recession, use of extra
help employees was increased to contain
costs and provide needed flexibility. This
practice is becoming problematic due to
provisions included in the Patient Protection
and Affordable Care Act (PPACA). During
FY 2012-13, the Board approved restoration
of funding to an Intervention Counselor
position, which had previously been frozen,
to assist in addressing this problem. For FY
2013-14, the Recommended Budget
includes restoration of funding for one
Resource Specialist position that was
previously frozen; a flexibly-staffed 0.25
FTE Mental Health Therapist I/II/III
position (currently filled at the Mental
Health Therapist II level) be transferred
from the MHSA budget (4-104) to the
Mental Health Services budget (4-102); a
vacant Day Treatment Coordinator position
deleted and reallocated as a Supervising
Intervention Counselor. It is recommended
that these actions be effective July 1, 2013.
The recommended budget includes a
reallocation of positions between the Mental
Health and MHSA budget units. It is
recommended that these changes be
approved effective July 1, 2013. The net
impact of these adjustments on this MHSA
budget is -0.05 FTE and the net impact on
the Mental Health Services budget (4-102) is
+0.05 FTE.
This budget is recommended at $19,313,885
which is an increase of $2,126,912 (12.4%)
compared to FY 2012-13. The
Welfare/Social Services fund as a whole
receives $449,000 in financing from the
General Fund in order to meet the County’s
Maintenance of Effort (MOE) for receipt of
CalWORKs and related Realignment
funding.
The recommended position allocation
includes a request for increased staffing of
six (6) full-time Public Assistance Specialist
positions, with an effective date of July 1,
2013, to handle the increased caseloads
related to the implementation of the
Customer Service Center.
Capital Assets recommendations include the
purchase of one mid-sized sedan ($21,500),
to replace an aging vehicle within the
Division’s fleet, and, related to the Customer
Service Center, a telephone system upgrade
($20,000), purchase of the VDI computer
equipment ($120,157), and a new HVAC
unit ($10,000) for the telecommunications
area.
During FY 2011-12, Public Safety
Realignment was implemented, which
realigned the responsibility for many
programs from the State to counties.
Because of this shift in funding, Sutter
County was mandated to establish the
County Local Revenue Fund 2011 (0-140).
For FY 2012-13, the Social Services
Realignment Fund 2011 (0-245) was
established to transfer funds from the
County Local Revenue Fund 2011 to the
operating budgets of the Welfare and Social
Services Division. The shift in funding
simply changed the flow of funding from the
State to the County without affecting the
overall amount of funding for programs. The
County Local Revenue Fund 2011 and the
Social Services Realignment Fund 2011 are
discussed in greater detail in their own
budget narrative.
This budget is recommended at $233,921,
which is an increase of $3,692 (1.6%)
compared to FY 2012-13. The General
Fund provides 62.4% of the funding for this
budget unit, an increase of 1.5% over the
prior year primarily due to a budgeted
$2,000 decrease in revenue coupled with a
$3,730 increase in salaries and benefits.
No reductions are recommended for this
budget unit. Any reductions to staffing
would necessitate a reduction in service to
conservatees and may cause frequent closing
of the office while staff are attending court
hearings and providing mandated services to
conservatees.

This budget is recommended at $1,704,322,
which is a decrease of $420,616 (19.8%)
compared to FY 2012-13. This decrease is due
to the implementation of SB 1036, which
established an MOE for each county’s IHSS
expenses. Any costs over the MOE amount
are paid by the State. The General Fund does
not providing any financing to this budget unit.

This budget is recommended at $9,507,744,
which is relatively unchanged compared to
FY 2012-13. The General Fund does not
provide any financing to this budget unit.
The County’s share of cost, $237,694, is met
with Welfare/Social Services 1991
Realignment funds (Fund 0-248).
As in FY 2012-13, the State’s share of
TANF costs, which is realized as revenue by
the County, flows through the County Local
Revenue Fund 2011 (0-140) as opposed to
being directly received by the Division
through the Welfare/Social Services Fund as
has occurred in the past. This year’s
recommendation reflects a technical budget
adjustment and has no net effect on the
budget. The County Local Revenue Fund
2011 is discussed in greater detail in its own
budget narrative.
This budget is recommended at $4,550,196
which is an increase of $395,987 (9.5%)
compared to FY 2012-13. The General
Fund does not provide any financing to this
budget unit. The County’s share of cost is
met with Welfare/Social Services 1991
Realignment funds (Fund 0-248).
The State’s share of Adoption costs, which
is realized as revenue by the County, flows
from the County Local Revenue Fund 2011
(0-140) through the Social Services
Realignment Fund 2011 (0-245) as opposed
to being directly received by the Division
through the Welfare/Social Services Fund as
had occurred in the past. The County Local
Revenue Fund 2011 and the Social Services
Realignment Fund 2011 are discussed in
greater detail in their own budget narrative.

This budget is recommended at $3,136,307,
which is an increase of 0.6% compared to FY
2012-13. This budget unit does not receive
any funding from the General Fund. All
funding is provided through State and Federal
sources.
The recommended budget reflects a proposed
change in three positions:
 Reclassify one Child Support
Specialist I/II position to a Child
Support Specialist III position
 Add Bilingual Pay for one Child
Support Supervisor position
 Delete one vacant Information
Systems Coordinator position
In FY 2011-12, the Chief Child Support
Attorney position was unfunded. It is
recommended that this continue in FY 2013-
14.
Additional reductions in this budget unit could
jeopardize the amount of State and Federal
funding that this budget unit would receive in
the future. The Department must spend all of
the funding that is received from these sources
in order to maintain this level of funding.

This budget is recommended at $3,173,073,
which is a decrease of $245,290 (7.2%)
compared to FY 2012-13. The General
Fund provides approximately 52% of the
financing for the District Attorney’s Office
and is decreased by $222,431 (7.8%)
compared to FY 2012-13.
It should be noted that these funding
calculations reflect the addition of Public
Safety Augmentation Funds (Proposition 172),
which are transferred into the Public Safety
fund through the Public Safety General budget
unit (2-210). California voters enacted
Proposition 172 in 1993, which established a
permanent statewide half-cent sales tax for
support of local public safety functions.
Proposition 172 funding is budgeted at
$6,500,000 for FY 2013-14 and the full
amount received is transferred from the Public
Safety Augmentation Fund (0-282) to the
Public Safety Fund (0-015). In FY 2013-14,
the General Fund is budgeted to contribute
approximately $14,000,000 in funding to the
Public Safety fund in excess of the $6,500,000
Proposition 172 funding.
The District Attorney’s Office has a Deputy
District Attorney position located in the Anti-
Drug Abuse budget unit. This position is
recommended for elimination. For FY 2013-
14, the CAO’s Office is recommending the
elimination of the Anti-Drug Abuse budget
unit. This recommendation is due to the
lack of funding available from the California
Board of State and Community Corrections
(BSCC). Because the attorney in the
eliminated position has seniority over some
attorneys in the District Attorney budget unit,
the employee is eligible to displace a lower
paid, less senior attorney. This results in an
increase of $45,414 to the District Attorney

budget unit, but an overall savings of $103,136
to the General Fund.
The District Attorney has requested, and the
CCP has approved, AB 109 funding for an
additional Deputy District Attorney position
for pre-trial services and revocation-related
duties. If the CCP budget plan is approved by
the Board of Supervisors, the displaced
attorney will have reemployment rights and be
able to remain employed with the District
Attorney’s Office. As a procedural matter, this
employee has been issued a preliminary layoff
notice. It is anticipated the CCP budget plan
will be presented to the Board of Supervisors
for consideration prior to June 30, 2013.
This budget recommendation also includes
the following position changes:
 Elimination of one filled Assistant Chief
Investigator position resulting in a
savings of approximately $144,000; and
 Eliminate of two filled Senior Criminal
Investigator positions resulting in
savings of approximately $213,000.
This recommendation leaves 6.0 FTEs
investigative staff including one (1.0 FTEs)
Chief Investigator position, three (3.0 FTEs)
Senior Criminal Investigator positions, one
(1.0 FTE) Investigative Aide position and
one (1.0 FTE) Criminal Intelligence
Technician position.
It is expected these reductions will leave the
Department with adequate investigative
staffing. These reductions will be monitored
during the year. It should be noted the
position allocation adopted for FY 2012-13
was incorrect. One Senior Criminal
Investigator position (1.0 FTE) and one
Victim Advocate position (0.5 FTE), both
vacant and unfunded, were inadvertently
omitted. This has been corrected and the
recommended position allocation for FY
2013-14 includes 28.5 FTEs.
The recommended budget includes the
continued use of Local Anti-Drug Programs
(0-264) funds and District Attorney Asset
Forfeiture Trust (0-293) funds. These
special revenue funds supplement the
District Attorney’s Office’s efforts to
investigate and prosecute crime.

This budget is recommended at $0. No
revenue is recommended due to the uncertainty
tied to the funding decisions yet to be made by
the BSCC. The residual General Fund
contribution is also recommended at $0.
Therefore, it is also recommended that
associated expenditures be eliminated. The
BSCC is not scheduled to make a decision on
the possible distribution of grant funds until at
least July of 2013.
It is recommended that the three positions in
this budget unit, one Deputy District Attorney,
one Deputy Probation Officer and one Deputy
Sheriff, be eliminated. Though actual work
assignments are dependent upon staffing
decisions made at the department level by the
District Attorney, the Chief Probation Officer
and the Sheriff, this recommendation will
likely result in the reduction of staff available
to assist NET-5 in combating the manufacture
and sale of illegal drugs in Sutter County.
If the BSCC makes funding available for the
continued operation of this budget unit,
additional recommendations will be brought to
the Board of Supervisors, including the
possible restoration of associated positions.
Service levels would depend upon the amount
and types of funding ultimately made available
by the State.

This budget is recommended at $42,208,
which is a decrease of $706 (1.6%)
compared to FY 2012-13. This slight
reduction is based upon projected
expenditures for FY 2012-13. The General
Fund provides 100% of the financing for
this budget unit.
It should be noted that many of the
expenditures incurred by each year’s Grand
Jury are authorized in Government Code and
are not restricted by the County’s annual
budget. These expenditure items are based
on the needs of each year’s Grand Jury and
may vary from year to year. The County
ultimately has limited ability to affect or
predict expenditures.

This budget is recommended at $6,271,937,
which is an increase of $826,709 (15.2%)
compared to FY 2012-13. The General Fund
provides approximately 44% of the funding for
this budget unit and is decreased by $40,345
(1.4%) compared to FY 2012-13. As indicated
by the reduction in General Fund support, the
increases in the Probation Department budget
are funded by non-General Fund revenues;
primarily AB 109.
This budget unit receives $71,000 in
Realignment (1991) funds, which are
transferred from the Local Health and Welfare
Trust, Social Services Fund (0-248).

This budget is recommended at $1,440,300,
which is the same as FY 2012-13. The
General Fund provides approximately 61%
of the financing for the Juvenile Hall budget
unit and is decreased by $9,000 (0.6%)
compared to FY 2013-14.
It should be noted that these funding
calculations reflect the addition of Public

Safety Augmentation Funds (Proposition
172), which are transferred into the Public
Safety fund through the Public Safety
General budget unit (2-210). California
voters enacted Proposition 172 in 1993,
which established a permanent statewide
half-cent sales tax for support of local public
safety functions. Proposition 172 funding is
budgeted at $6,500,000 for FY 2013-14 and
the full amount received is transferred from
the Public Safety Augmentation Fund (0-
282) to the Public Safety Fund (0-015). In
FY 2013-14, the General Fund is budgeted
to contribute approximately $14,000,000 in
funding to the Public Safety fund in excess
of the $6,500,000 Proposition 172 funding.
This budget is recommended at $655,441
which is an increase of $9,830 (1.5%)
compared to FY 2012-13. The General
Fund provides 94.9% of the financing for
this budget unit and is increased by $5,444
(0.9%). However, Public Defender Growth
Special Account funds related to Public
Safety Realignment will be received in
September 2013. This funding is expected
to increase Public Defender revenue by
approximately $10,000. This funding is for
revocation activities with both the Public
Defender and District Attorney’s Offices
receiving an equal share. Once more
specific information is available about the
growth allocations, additional budget
recommendations for FY 2013-14 will be
brought to the Board of Supervisors.
In order to maintain the quality of services
provided to indigent defendants and assure
that court proceedings are not interrupted or
delayed because the Public Defender’s
Office is unable to accept an appointment, it
is requested that the Services and Supplies
portion of the budget be increased. This
increase would be accomplished through a
increase in Professional & Specialized
Services for Felony attorney services.
In comparing appointed felony cases for the
first eight months of FY 2011-12 with the
first eight months of FY 2012-13, there was
a 23% increase in appointed felony cases.
Commencing July of 2013, the Public
Defender’s office, by law, will be appointed
to parole and Post Release Community
Supervision revocation proceedings. As a
result, Felony Public Defender costs will be
increased by $200.00 per month for a total
increase of $7,200.
Though the Superior Court is ordering in
some cases, as a condition of probation,
payment of a nominal fee for reimbursement
to the County of Sutter for the services of
the Public Defender’s Office, it is difficult to
predict how much revenue will be received
for FY 2013-14. The Sutter County Public
Defender’s Office has been able to collect
for services rendered to those who have
been involuntarily held at private psychiatric
centers. Based upon the first eight months
of FY 2012-13, it is anticipated the
Department should receive reimbursement
revenues totaling $5,200 for FY 2013-14.
Reductions for the Public Defender’s Office
are not recommended. Reductions would
directly impact the number of attorneys
available to provide assistance to court
appointed individuals. Additionally, as
mentioned previously, growth funding is
expected in September 2013 to augment the
Public Defender’s budget.
This budget is recommended at
$20,309,644. This is an increase of
$473,979 (2.4%). All funding is provided
by the State through Public Safety
Realignment.
As previously stated, this fund is designed to
be a “pass-through” budget where funds will
immediately pass through to the appropriate
operating budget or special revenue fund as
budgeted. Funding budgeted to be used
completely each fiscal year will pass through
to an operating budget, while funds not used
completely in a single fiscal year will pass
through to a special revenue fund, such that
any unused funds will remain separate across
budget years. This prevents fund balances
from becoming co-mingled and will allow
each department responsible for these
realigned funds to accurately and more easily
track the expenditure and fund balance of
individual revenue streams.

This budget is recommended at $2,775,910,
which is a decrease of $190,037 (6.4%).
The General Fund provides approximately
56% of the financing for the Sheriff’s
Department and is decreased in the
Communications budget by $80,823 (3.1%)
compared to FY 2012-13.
It should be noted that these funding
calculations reflect the addition of Public
Safety Augmentation Funds (Proposition
172), which are transferred into the Public
Safety fund through the Public Safety
General budget unit (2-210). California
voters enacted Proposition 172 in 1993,
which established a permanent statewide
half-cent sales tax for support of local public
safety functions. Proposition 172 funding is
budgeted at $6,500,000 for FY 2013-14 and
the full amount received is transferred from
the Public Safety Augmentation Fund (0-
282) to the Public Safety Fund (0-015). In
FY 2013-14, the General Fund is budgeted
to contribute approximately $14,000,000 in
funding to the Public Safety fund in excess
of the $6,500,000 Proposition 172 funding.
The recommended budget includes the
continued use of Sheriff’s Assessment Fee
Funds (0-225) to fund a Sheriff’s Legal
Specialist position. These funds were first
used for this purpose in FY 2011-12. This
reduces the General Fund contribution for
this position to approximately $8,000 for FY
2013-14.
For the third consecutive year, it is
recommended to leave three positions
vacant and unfunded in the Communications
budget. These positions are a Criminal
Records Technician, a Public Safety
Dispatcher and a Supervising Public Safety
Dispatcher. Defunding and leaving these

positions vacant negatively impacts the level
of service internally and to the public.
Further reductions are not recommended at
this time.

This budget is recommended at $6,144,492,
which is an increase of $202,106 (3.4%)
compared to FY 2012-13. The General
Fund provides approximately 56% of the
financing for the Sheriff’s Department and is
increased in the Sheriff-Coroner budget by
$418,158 (8.2%) compared to FY 2012-13.
It should be noted that these funding
calculations reflect the addition of Public
Safety Augmentation Funds (Proposition
172), which are transferred into the Public
Safety fund through the Public Safety
General budget unit (2-210). California
voters enacted Proposition 172 in 1993,
which established a permanent statewide
half-cent sales tax for support of local public
safety functions. Proposition 172 funding is
budgeted at $6,500,000 for FY 2013-14 and
the full amount received is transferred from
the Public Safety Augmentation Fund (0-
282) to the Public Safety Fund (0-015). In
FY 2013-14, the General Fund is budgeted
to contribute approximately $14,000,000 in
funding to the Public Safety fund in excess
of the $6,500,000 Proposition 172 funding.
For FY 2013-14, it is recommended that
three (3) currently vacant Deputy Sheriff
positions be eliminated. This is in addition
to the recommended elimination of one
Deputy Sheriff position in the Anti-Drug
Abuse (2-302) budget unit. Even with these
vacancies, the Sheriff’s number of filled
Deputy Sheriff positions will be similar to
the average number of filled positions over
the past several years. Since FY 2008-09,
the average number of filled Deputy Sheriff
positions in the Sheriff-Coroner budget unit
has been 29. The current recommendation
provides for 28 filled Deputy Sheriff
positions in the Sheriff-Coroner budget unit.
In FY 2012-13, in addition to the three (3)
vacant Deputy Sheriff positions that were
vacant at that time, one additional vacant
position, for a total of four (4) Deputy Sheriff
positions, was left vacant and unfunded. The
FY 2013-14 budget recommendation
maintains these four positions as vacant and
unfunded. In the event funding becomes
available, a recommendation to fill either one
or several of these positions may be presented
to the Board of Supervisors.
Capital Assets are recommended at $242,500
for the purchase of five (5) replacement patrol
vehicles. The vehicles to be replaced all have
close to or over 90,000 miles, with two
currently over 100,000 miles. Vehicles are
generally purchased in the spring of each year
making it likely each vehicle will have an
additional 20,000 miles by the time they are
replaced in 2014.
COPS funds are not currently budgeted in the
FY 2013-14 recommended budget. The

Sheriff has not yet determined how these
funds will be used. Once that determination
is made, the Sheriff will present his
recommendations to the Board of Supervisors
along with a budget amendment. COPS
funds may not be used to supplant current
County public safety funding and therefore do
not reduce the General Fund contribution to
the Public Safety Fund. It is anticipated the
Sheriff-Coroner will have approximately
$100,000 in COPS funding available for use
in FY 2013-14.

This budget is recommended at $132,022,
which is an increase of $5,601 (4.4%) over
FY 2012-13. This increase is offset by
revenue from the other two participating
agencies and CalMMET revenue transferred
in from the County Local Revenue Fund
2011 (0-140) and results in no unreimbursed
cost for the General Fund. The County
Local Revenue Fund 2011 is discussed in
greater detail in its own budget narrative.

This budget is recommended at $284,808,
which is a decrease of $17,032 (5.6%)
compared to FY 2012-13. The General Fund
provides approximately 56% of the financing
for the Sheriff’s Department and is decreased
in the Sheriff – Boat Patrol budget by
$18,776 (27%).
It should be noted that these funding
calculations reflect the addition of Public
Safety Augmentation Funds (Proposition
172), which are transferred into the Public
Safety fund through the Public Safety
General budget unit (2-210). California
voters enacted Proposition 172 in 1993,
which established a permanent statewide
half-cent sales tax for support of local public
safety functions. Proposition 172 funding is
budgeted at $6,500,000 for FY 2013-14 and
the full amount received is transferred from
the Public Safety Augmentation Fund (0-282)
to the Public Safety Fund (0-015). In FY
2013-14, the General Fund is budgeted to
contribute approximately $14,000,000 in
funding to the Public Safety fund in excess of
the $6,500,000 Proposition 172 funding.
Total expenditures for the Boat Patrol budget
unit are largely reimbursed by the State
Department of Boating and Waterways.
These reimbursements are derived from boat
registration fees. The County contributes
collected boat taxes and pays for
expenditures not subject to State
reimbursement. As indicated above, this
budget unit also receives, in concept, a share
of Proposition 172 funding.
The Department of Boating and Waterways’
allocation to Sutter County is likely to remain
at $214,800 as it has for the past several
years. Thus, any expenditure increases
beyond the allocation and collected boat
taxes would become a County General Fund
cost.
No reductions are recommended for this
budget unit. However, the Sheriff staffs this
budget unit with personnel from the Sheriff-
Coroner budget unit (2-201), where there is a
FY 2013-14 budget recommendation to
eliminate three (3) vacant Deputy Sheriff
positions. Any reductions to the Sheriff-
Coroner budget unit may correspondingly
reduce Boat Patrol staffing.

This budget is recommended at $1,203,572,
which is a decrease of $9,774 (0.8%)
compared to FY 2012-13. The General Fund
provides approximately 56% of the financing
for the Sheriff’s Department and is decreased
in the Sheriff – Live Oak budget by $22,418
(10.7%) compared to FY 2012-13.
The majority of costs for patrolling the area
in and around the City of Live Oak are
shared 80% by the City and 20% by the
County. However, the salary and benefits of

a Lieutenant position, all dog handlingrelated
items, and new patrol vehicles are
costs covered in full by the City. The
Sheriff provides some law-enforcement
services to the City of Live Oak at no charge
for which the City would have to pay if it
were to have its own police department, or if
it had a typical contract for sheriff services.
Among these services are dispatch,
detectives (for major felonies), records,
narcotics, and special enforcement detail
(SWAT).
No reductions are recommended for this
budget unit. However, the Sheriff staffs this
budget unit with personnel from the Sheriff-
Coroner budget unit (2-201), where there is
a FY 2013-14 budget recommendation to
eliminate three (3) vacant Deputy Sheriff
positions. Any reductions to the Sheriff-
Coroner budget unit may correspondingly
reduce Sheriff – Live Oak staffing. Any
changes to staffing levels would necessitate
an adjustment to the contract between Sutter
County and the City of Live Oak.

This budget is recommended at $8,621,644,
which is an increase of $221,351 (2.6%)
compared to FY 2012-13. The General
Fund provides approximately 56% of the
financing for the Sheriff’s Department and is
increased in the Jail budget by $132,179
(1.7%) compared to FY 2012-13.
It should be noted that these funding
calculations reflect the addition of Public
Safety Augmentation Funds (Proposition
172), which are transferred into the Public
Safety fund through the Public Safety
General budget unit (2-210). California
voters enacted Proposition 172 in 1993,
which established a permanent statewide
half-cent sales tax for support of local public
safety functions. Proposition 172 funding is
budgeted at $6,500,000 for FY 2013-14 and
the full amount received is transferred from
the Public Safety Augmentation Fund (0-
282) to the Public Safety Fund (0-015). In
FY 2013-14, the General Fund is budgeted
to contribute approximately $14,000,000 in
funding to the Public Safety fund in excess
of the $6,500,000 Proposition 172 funding.
Jail Medical expenses are budgeted to
increase by $60,190 over FY 2012-13. The
Jail Medical budget (4-134) is discussed in
greater detail in its own budget narrative.
Though overall budget reductions are a
necessity of the FY 2013-14 Recommended
Budget, no reductions are recommended for
the Jail budget unit. The effects of Public
Safety Realignment are likely to be more
fully realized during FY 2013-14 with an
anticipated further increase in Jail
population and related increases in costs in
staffing, inmate medical costs, and other
related expenses.
