During the upcoming year, the Department of Social Services, again, expects to see an increase in needs. It is yet unknown how the
implementation of the 2011 State Realignment will affect the ability to meet these needs. Accordingly, it will be critical to monitor budget and
services through-out the fiscal year. Additionally in the upcoming year Social Services will have to start the reviewing processes, procedure and
staffing for the upcoming implementation of health care reform. Currently it is expected the Social Services will be the “point of entry” for health
care coverage and benefits. As such it will be essential we work with the State and other County Agencies to collaborate on successful
coordination of processes to provide the highest quality services. Finally, as the 3 year State mandated System improvement Plan in Child
Welfare concludes we will be working with the community to assess current needs and available services to develop a further System
Improvement Plan that continues to build on the successes of the past.
During the upcoming Fiscal Year Mono County will continue to work with Inyo to meet the needs of the community within the

critical effects on funding and make it necessary to re-exam the Region in the context of realignment.
