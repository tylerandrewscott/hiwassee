This budget is recommended at $2,557,293.
The General Fund provides 42.1% of the
financing for this budget unit and is
decreased by $50,545 (4.5%) compared to
FY 2013-14.
This budget is recommended at $14,500.
This is a 3.7% decrease as compared to FY
2013-14. This budget unit does not receive
any funding directly from the General Fund,
however, $6,500, which is Sutter County’s
portion of the Maintenance and
Replacement costs, is budgeted as an
Interfund expense in the Agricultural
Commissioner’s budget unit (2-601). The
rest of the funding is provided by revenues
collected from Yuba and Nevada Counties.
This budget is recommended at $212,097. The
General Fund provides 62.9% of the financing
for this budget unit and is reduced $1,476
(1.1%) compared to FY 2013-14.
This budget is recommended at $1,166,635,
which is a decrease of $62,357 (5.1%) from
the FY 2013-14 Adopted Budget. The
General Fund provides 71.6% of the
financing for this budget and has decreased
$7,259 (0.9%) compared to FY 2013-14.
It is recommended to decrease one full time
(1.0 FTE) Library Technician to a part-time
(0.6 FTE) position. This is a voluntary
reduction in hours.
It is also recommended to eliminate one
vacant and defunded Supervising Library
Technician position and one vacant and
defunded Library Technician position.
Based on the current structure at the Library,
it is not anticipated that funding for either of
these two positions will be able to be
restored in the future.
The WIA Title II Literacy Grant was open to
new applicants for FY 2014-15. With more
organizations competing for this grant,
funding is projected to be lower for the
coming fiscal year.
This budget is recommended at
$167,950. The general fund provides
87.9% of the financing for this budget
and is decreased $9,023 (5.8%) compared
to FY 2013-14.
The two County paid positions remain
funded at 80%. Staff report that the backlog of curatorial work is growing. Staff
addresses day-to-day operations, which
takes a large portion of the day, leaving little
time to reduce the backlog.
Revenue from the Museum Commission is
recommended at $20,000, which covers
Extra Help staffing, postage, Services and
Supplies, and additional related expenses.
The County Administrative Office does not
make recommendations for funding in this
budget unit, as these funding decisions are
made solely at the discretion of the Board of
Supervisors. No amount has been budgeted
for the requested subsidies.
In FY 2013-14 a total of $14,500 was
appropriated for the following subsidy
organizations:
 Yuba-Sutter Regional Arts Council: $5,000
 Central Valley Homeless
Veteran’s Assistance Program: $1,000
 Friday Night Live: $1,000
 The Acting Company: $2,500
 Sutter County Resource Conservation
District: $5,000
This budget is recommended at $91,522. The
General Fund provides 100% of the financing
for Sutter County’s share of the Veteran’s
Services Officer budget and remains relatively
unchanged compared to FY 2013-14.
This recommendation reflects only Sutter
County’s net share of cost.
This budget unit is based on a Bi-County
agreement and any additional reductions
would have to be negotiated with Yuba
County.
This budget is recommended at $518,858,
which is a decrease of $25,742 (4.7%)
compared to FY 2013-14. The General
Fund provides 15.3% of the financing for
this budget unit and is decreased by
$215,649 (73.1%) compared to FY 2013-14.
The decrease in General Fund support is
primarily due to the shift in Road Fund
administrative revenue from the Engineering
Services (1-920) budget unit to the
Development Services Administration
budget unit.
The recommended budget also reflects
leaving one Office Assistant II position
vacant and unfunded for FY 2014-15. The
Department’s administrative functions will
be monitored throughout FY 2014-15 and
any recommended changes will be brought
to the Board of Supervisors for
consideration.
This budget is recommended at $17,379. In
FY 2014-15, this amount will be paid back
to the cash balance of the hangar loan.
The General Fund does not generally
provide any funding for this budget unit;
however, a General Fund loan, not to exceed
$185,000, was granted in FY 2010-11 to
fund on-going operations. Only a portion of
that loan has been utilized to date.
SBRAA’s proposed budget for management
of the airport includes proceeds to pay back
the General Fund loan over time.
This budget is recommended at $701,289,
which is a decrease of $94,416 (11.9%)
compared to FY 2013-14. The General Fund
provides 20.9% of the financing for this
budget and is decreased by $64,816 (30.7%)
for FY 2014-15.
The Development Services Department has
requested, and the Recommended Budget
includes, an Associate Civil Engineer position
allocation be reassigned to the Water
Resources (1-922) budget unit to complete
critical duties. If approved, an experienced
Associate Civil Engineer will be transferred
from Engineering Services to Water
Resources to complete these duties. This
results in a decrease of $146,475 for the
Engineering Services budget unit for FY
2014-15.
It is also recommended that a replacement
Associate Civil Engineer position allocation
be added back to the Engineering Services
budget unit, and approved to be filled,
effective January 1, 2015. This results in an
increase of $61,630 for the Engineering
Services budget unit for FY 2014-15.
Therefore, there is no change to the total
positions reflected in the Engineering Services
position allocation schedule.
This budget is recommended at $687,581,
which is a decrease of $1,406 (0.2%)
compared to FY 2013-14. This budget unit
does not receive any funding from the
General Fund. The net cost of this budget
unit is covered by permit revenues and an
Interfund transfer from the Health fund
(1991 Realignment funding).
In FY 2013-14, one vacant Environmental
Specialist II position was eliminated,
resulting in the current six (6.0) FTE
position allocation. For FY 2014-15, no
additional positions are requested or
recommended.
This budget is recommended at $271,751,
which is a net increase of just $1 compared
to FY 2013-14. This budget includes
Intrafund CUPA-Environmental Health
charges for services provided from the
Environmental Health (2-725) budget unit.
This budget unit does not receive any
funding from the General Fund as the net
cost is covered by permit revenue, and
grants.
This budget is recommended at $271,559,
which is an increase of $12,512 (4.8%)
compared to FY 2013-14. This budget unit
is within the Public Safety fund; however, is
considered to be funded primarily by the
General Fund, which provides 96.5% of the
financing for this budget unit. This is an
increase of $8,012 (3.2%) for FY 2014-15.
This budget is recommended at $653,800,
which is a decrease of $15,900 (2.4%)
compared to FY 2013-14. This budget unit
does not receive any funding from the
General Fund. All funding is provided
through property taxes and interest.
This budget is recommended at $2,900,114,
which is an increase of $34,007 (1.2%)
compared to FY 2013-14. This budget unit
does not receive any funding from the
General Fund. All funding is provided
through property taxes, City of Live Oak
contract revenues, and interest earnings.
Capital Assets are recommended at
$447,600 for the following grant-funded
purchases:
 $50,000 for an air compressor
 $397,600 for 71 SCBA units
The recommended budget also includes the
financing and appropriations for equipment
to be purchased with the Assistance to
Firefighters grant as explained above. If the
grant is not approved, a separate plan for
replacement of the equipment over time will
be brought to the Board of Supervisors for
approval.
This budget is recommended at $494,054,
which is an increase of $228,564 (86.1%)
compared to FY 2013-14. This budget unit
does not receive any funding from the
General Fund. All funding is provided
through property taxes and interest.
Capital Assets are recommended at
$383,700 for the following grant-funded
purchases:
 $67,200 for 12 replacement SCBA
units
 $316,500 for a replacement Type I
Fire Engine
The increase in this budget is related to the
replacement of one Type 1 Fire Engine.
The Recommended Budget includes the
financing and appropriations for equipment
to be purchased with the Assistance to
Firefighters grant as explained above and the
purchase of a Type II Fire Engine. If the
grant is not approved, a separate plan for
replacement of the equipment over time will
be brought to the Board for approval.
This budget is recommended at $543,159,
which is an increase of $206,749 (61.5%)
compared to FY 2013-14. This budget unit
does not receive any funding from the
General Fund. All funding is provided

$412,000 for the following grant-funded
purchases:
 $84,000 for 15 replacement SCBA
units
 $328,000 for a replacement Type I
Fire Engine
The increase in this budget unit is related
to the replacement of one Type 1 Fire
Engine recommended to be purchased
during FY 2014-15.
The Recommended Budget includes the
financing and appropriations for equipment
to be purchased with the Assistance to
Firefighters grant as explained above. If the
grant is not approved, a separate plan for
replacing the equipment over time will be
brought to the Board of Supervisors for
approval.
This budget is recommended at $781,839.
Because reimbursement cannot be claimed
until the construction contract is awarded,
this budget reflects the transfer-in of funds
from the County’s Criminal Justice
Development Impact Fee fund (0-102) to
cover any required local match and to
advance funds to complete the initial phases
of the project prior to receiving
reimbursement. The Criminal Justice
Development Impact Fee fund will be
reimbursed once State reimbursement
monies are received.
This budget is recommended at $3,616,154,
which is a decrease of $445,270 (11.0%)
compared to FY 2013-14. The General
Fund provides 32.7% of the financing for
this budget unit and is reduced by $201,502
(14.6%) for FY 2014-15.
It is recommended the Deputy Director of
Planning and Building position remain
vacant and unfunded through FY 2014-15.
This results in a cost reduction of $140,080.
These duties continue to be completed by
the Director of Development Services.
Due to an increased need for building
inspection services, it is recommended the
Limited Term Building Inspector II position
be authorized for FY 2014-15 through June
30, 2015. This represents a relative cost
increase of $91,915. This Limited Term
position is funded in concept with savings
from leaving the Deputy Director position
vacant and unfunded through FY 2014-15.
This budget is recommended at $9,272,919,
which is an increase of $2,550,728 (37.9%)
compared to FY 2013-14. The Road budget
unit does not receive any funding support
from the General Fund.
Capital Assets are recommended at
$277,700 to purchase the following items:
 $200,000 Replacement Water Truck
 $35,000 Replacement Utility Bed
Truck
 $30,000 Replacement ¾ Ton Truck
 $12,700 Replacement Plotter/Printer
Because the construction season spans two
fiscal years, the Recommended Budget
includes funding and appropriations for the
carryover of selected construction projects
originally budgeted in the previous fiscal
year and may contain portions of the
previous fiscal year Road Plan.
The FY 2014-15 Recommended Budget
includes the following major projects as
described in the adopted FY 2014-15 Road
Plan (attached):
 Micro-Surfacing for $373,800
(Budgeted $400,000)
o Reclamation Road from
Tisdale Road to Pelger Rd
$182,000
o Reclamation Road from
Pelger Road to Kirksville
Road $115,150
o Reclamation Road from
Kirksville Road to SR 113
$76,650
 Grading/Paving $80,000 (Budgeted
$80,000)
o Various ADA Sidewalk
Reconstruction
 2” Contract Overlay $874,375
(Budgeted $875,000)
o Kirksville Road from
Sacramento Avenue to SR
113 - $716,042
o West Catlett Road from
4000’ W. SR 99 to SR 99 -
$158,333
Interfund Development Services-
Administration Services and Interfund
Development Services-Road expenses were
separated into two accounts. The total
recommendation is $757,727, which is an
increase of $99,296 (13%) compared to FY
2013-14. The administrative and road
Interfund charges include engineering,
accounting and management staff time spent
in support of the Road Division.
Interfund Miscellaneous Non-Road revenues
are recommended at $31,950, a decrease of
$102,617. The revenue reflects charges to
other budget units for administrative,
engineering, weed control, and maintenance
work performed by staff in the Road
Division.
The State Highway Users Tax
Apportionment (HUTA) revenues are based
on current market conditions. The revenues
from HUTA sections 2104, 2105 and 2106
fund most of the in-house road program, and
HUTA section 2103 is used to provide a
portion of the major maintenance and
rehabilitation programs in the Road Plan.
State and Federal highway program and
grant funds, when available, are also applied
to this endeavor.
Annually, the County receives a portion of
the Local Transportation Fund (LTF) under
the Transportation Development Act (TDA).
These funds are available for road work
after public transportation needs have been
met. Under an agreement with the Yuba–
Sutter Transportation Agency, an allocation
of funds is made to the County, which is
used for general road maintenance and
repairs. The annual amount available
depends on State revenues and is estimated
at $730,000 for FY 2014-15.
The County may also receive $278,075 in
State funds under a sub-program of Regional
Surface Transportation Program (RSTP); an
exchange for Federal funds. This is an
annual amount provided to counties and is
being considered for elimination by the
State.
This budget unit is recommended at $106,469,
which is a decrease of $43,531 (29%)
compared to FY 2013-14. This budget unit
does not receive any funding from the General
Fund. Funding for this program comes from
the County’s share of the Local Transportation
Fund (LTF) and is used to fund unmet transit
needs as required by State law.
This budget is recommended at $65,604,
which is a decrease of $10,446 (13.7%)
compared to FY 2013-14. This budget unit
does not receive financing from the General
Fund. The District receives its funding from
ad valorem property taxes on properties
within the district.
This budget is recommended at $380, which
is a decrease of $470 (55.3%) compared to
FY 2013-14. The General Fund does not
provide any financing for this budget unit.
This budget is recommended at $221, which
is a decrease of $299 (57.5%) compared to
FY 2013-14. The General Fund does not
provide any financing for this budget unit.
This budget is recommended at $31,752,
which is an increase of $6,653 (26.5%)
compared to FY 2013-14. The General
Fund does not provide any financing for this
budget unit.
This budget unit is recommended at $815,417,
which is an increase of $99,588 (13.9%)
compared to FY 2013-14. The General Fund
provides 53.0% of the financing for this
budget unit and is increased by $195,445
(82.5%) for FY 2014-15. This increase is
primarily related to the recommended
reassignment of an Associate Civil Engineer
position allocation from the Engineering
Services budget unit (1-920) to this budget
unit. An experienced civil engineer will be
assigned to this position.
The Water and Wastewater System Operator
position is recommended to be transferred to
the Water/Wastewater Facilities (1-701)
budget unit. This position is a maintenance
position and current duties are better reflected
in General Services, which manages the
Building Maintenance Division. A portion
of the position will assist the
Building Maintenance Division (1-700)
with duties as assigned. Therefore, there is
no change to the Water Resources position
allocation schedule.
Approximately 80% of the funding for
services provided under the Water Resources
Engineering program is provided by the
General Fund. The remainder is provided
through a combination of reimbursements
from SCWA, WWD1 and Rio Ramaza.
The Maintenance program has 2.0 FTE funded
staff positions. In FY 2010-11, a Public
Works Equipment Operator position was
defunded and remains vacant and unfunded.
The Road Department (3-100) budget unit
provides labor and equipment to maintain
collection ditches, inlets, storm drains,
pumping stations, open channel conveyances,
and maintenance of the Live Oak Canal.
The General Fund provides 11.6% of the
funding for services provided under the
Maintenance program. The remainder is
provided through a combination of
reimbursements from the SCWA Zones of
Benefit and the Road Fund.
This budget is recommended at $178,200,
which is a decrease of $400,000 (69.2%)
compared to FY 2013-14. The General Fund
provides 16.9% of the financing for this
budget unit and is the same as FY 2013-14.
This budget is recommended at $137,350,
which is a decrease of $1,260 (0.9%)
compared to FY 2013-14. This budget unit
does not receive any funding from the General
Fund.
This budget is recommended at $114,975, an
increase of $950 (0.8%) compared to FY
2013-14. This budget unit does not receive
any funding from the General Fund. All
funding is provided through tax assessments.
These budgets are recommended as follows:
 Zone 2 (0-324): $250
 Zone 11 (0-332): $1,150
 Zone 12 (0-333): $22
 Zone 13 (0-334): $680
These budget units do not receive any funding
from the General Fund. All funding is
provided through charges, fees and interest.
These budget units are recommended as
follows:
 Fund 326-Zone 4 $11,180
 Fund 327-Zone 5 $5,000
 Fund 328-Zone 6 $48,600
 Fund 329-Zone 7 $8,757
 Fund 330-Zone 8 $12,337
These budget units do not receive any funding
from the General Fund. Assessments within
the Zones of Benefit are reviewed and
adjusted annually.
This budget is recommended at $5,560, which
is a decrease of $60 (1.1%) compared to FY
2013-14. This budget unit does not receive
any funding from the General Fund.
The FY 2014-15 recommended budget for
Waterworks District No. 1 totals $244,191
for the water system (01) and $256,993 for
the Wastewater Service (02). The budget
reflects the total expenditures
associated with Operations &
Maintenance, Structure Improvements, and
Depreciation Expense.
The majority of the District’s expenses are
associated with maintenance and operations.
This category includes supplies and materials,
electricity, chemicals, professional services,
monitoring, state permits, repair and
maintenance expenses, staff expenses for the
operator and engineering support staff, and
other costs associated with operating the water
system. There are also administrative costs
incurred by the District, such as costs
associated with performing utility billing
services and accounting for the District.
The District is under a Compliance Order for
arsenic exceedance in the water service
program. In order to comply with the order,
the District needs to update the water
treatment plant. The FY 2012-13 budget that
was approved by the District’s Board of
Directors included expenses associated with
an arsenic remediation feasibility study
associated with the design of a new water
treatment plant that includes arsenic removal
technologies. Most major budget changes
reflect the ongoing staff efforts and receipt of
State grant income associated with this
feasibility study.
In January 2013, a new wastewater fee of
$73.50 per Equivalent Dwelling Unit (EDU)
was adopted by the District Board of Directors
in an effort to cover the actual ongoing
operations and maintenance costs associated
with operating the wastewater services for the
District. The new wastewater fee went into
effect on July 1, 2013. In November 2013, a
new monthly water fee of $70.00 per EDU for
water service was adopted by the District’s
Board of Directors. The new water fee went
into effect on January 1, 2014.
Budgeted operating revenues do not include
enough revenue to meet the non-cash
Depreciation Expense of $126,069 for the
wastewater system, or the Depreciation
Expense of $34,452 for the water system.
Historically, the replacement costs for
infrastructure have been provided by State
grants.
Currently, the District is in the process of
procuring grant funding for a number of
wastewater collection and treatment
improvements, plus grant funding for the
water main leak detection and installation of
water meters. The District will soon be
applying for grant funding to construct a new
water treatment plant that includes arsenic
removal. While the Water Service Program (01) and
Wastewater Service Program (02) expects
ongoing revenue to cover all ongoing
expenses, total revenues for the District are
not expected to cover all ongoing operations
and maintenance expenditures including
depreciation expense in FY 2014-15, resulting
in a projected deficit of $253,956 for the fiscal
year. This is in addition to prior deficits,
which were considered in February of 2011
when the Sutter County Board of Supervisors
approved an “interim” loan from the General
Fund to the District. The loan was approved
up to a maximum of $670,000 and for the
period of 18 months. When approved, it was
anticipated that prior to the end of the 18
month term of the loan, the District would
refinance the loan, request the forgiveness of
all or a portion of the loan, or otherwise repay
the loan. These options will need to be
considered by the District in the coming fiscal
year.
This budget is recommended at $2,158,949.
The General Fund provides 98.9% of the
financing for the Department, and is
increased by $89,320 (4.4%) compared to
FY 2013-14.
The increase in the Department’s
unreimbursed cost is primarily due to the
reduction in the Interfund Transfer-In from the
State-County Property Tax Program special
revenue fund (0-181). This was first budgeted
in FY 2010-11 to offset staff costs, in an effort
to avoid further budget reductions in the
Assessor’s budget unit. With the FY 2014-15
budget, it is recommended that the Interfund
Transfer-In be reduced to $16,000. The
recommended $16,000 will offset Extra Help
staff costs, which is also recommended at
$16,000. The funds in this special revenue
fund reflect the remaining balance of funds
received under the State’s former State-County
Property Tax Administration Grant Program,
which was eliminated by the State Legislature
effective for FY 2006-07. This funding source
previously provided additional revenue to
augment staffing and for acquisition of new
equipment and technology necessary to
enhance staff proficiency and productivity and
to eliminate backlogs. As indicated above,
these funds have been used recently to offset
regular staffing costs in the Assessor’s office,
but those funds are now virtually depleted. It
is anticipated that the remaining balance in the
fund will be approximately $46,400 on July 1,
2014.
Salaries and related benefits have been
reduced, for FY 2014-15 only, by $56,800 to
reflect current vacancies and anticipated
staffing turnover. Additional savings may
be achieved during the year. No formal
staffing reductions are recommended at this
time.
Capital Assets are recommended at $46,500
for the purchase of one replacement pick-up
truck ($25,500) and one replacement small
SUV ($21,000). These vehicles will replace
vehicles #313, a 1998 pick-up, and vehicle
#269, a 1999 sedan. Both vehicles have had
mechanical problems and have proven to be
unreliable and costly to maintain.
This budget is recommended at $326,008,
which is a decrease of $20,212 compared to
FY 2013-14.
This budget is recommended at $186,220.
The General Fund provides 99.6% of the
financing for this budget unit and is
increased by $7,600 (4.3%) compared to FY
2013-14.
The Recommended Budget includes
$2,000 for the purchase of a replacement
laptop computer which is used by the
Clerk of the Board to record minutes and
actions of the Board during meetings of
the Board of Supervisors. This computer
will be added to the County’s
replacement plan once purchased, and
will be eligible for scheduled replacement in
the future.
This budget is recommended at $779,590.
The General Fund provides 89.3% of the
financing for this budget unit and is
increased by $24,545 (3.7%) compared
to FY 2013-14.
Salaries and related benefits reflect a general
increase of $12,313 due to negotiated
benefits, including a countywide increase in
Retirement and Health insurance premium
costs.
The Department received a $30,000 State
Grant in FY 2013-14. This grant funding is
recommended at $5,000 for FY 2014-15,
resulting in a recommended reduction of
$25,000.
Previous budgets have included funding for
smaller, less frequent landowner and utility
district elections (UDEL). This budget does
not include funding for these elections. In
the event such an election is called, a budget
amendment requiring Board action would be
required. If one of these elections is called,
it would be reimbursed by the entity
requiring the election.
This budget is recommended at $530,269.
The General Fund provides 5.5% of the
financing for this budget unit and is
increased by $1,876 (6.9%) compared to FY
2013-14.
Salaries and related benefits reflect a general
increase of $9,313 due to negotiated
benefits, including a countywide increase in
Retirement and Health insurance premium
costs.
The recommended increase of $10,000 in
Office Equipment is to purchase two
replacement document recording scanners.
Recording Fee revenue for this budget unit
is anticipated to decrease by $35,000 based
on a decrease in the number of recordings
during FY 2013-14. It is anticipated that
this decrease will extend into FY 2014-15.
The increase in Recording Fee revenue is
recommended to be offset by an increase of
$94,000 in the transfer-in of funds from the
Department’s various Special Revenue
Funds, to fund special project work in
recognition of the reduction in recording
work.
The recommended budget maintains one
frozen and unfunded Deputy Clerk-Recorder
position, which was defunded in FY 2011-12,
and maintains the department Accountant I
position at .60 FTE (60% position).
This budget is recommended at $213,146
The General Fund provides 47.8% of the
financing for this budget unit and is
decreased by $6,848 (6.3%) compared to FY
2013-14, due to a $6,567 decrease in
Interfund Information Technology charges.
This budget is recommended at $20,000,
which is the same as FY 2013-14. The
General Fund does not provide any
financing for this budget unit.
It is recommended that a 10%
Administration fee, allowed by legislation,
be charged to cover the County cost to
administer this program. This fee will be
brought to the Board for consideration in FY
2014-15.
The budget is recommended at $1,095,415.
The General Fund provides 99.7% of the
financing for this budget unit, and is
increased by $55,408 (5.3%) compared to
FY 2013-14. A portion of the costs for this
budget unit are recouped from the Local
Agency Formation Commission for staff
support, and through the annual A-87 cost
plan.
It is recommended that the Human
Resources function of the County be
reassigned to the County Administrative
Office for FY 2014-15. As discussed in the
Human Resources budget unit (1-401), it is
recommended that the Human Resources
Director position be eliminated. The FY
2014-15 Recommended Organization Chart
reflects the recommended reporting structure
for this year. The organizational structure of
the combined departments will be further
evaluated during FY 2014-15.
The County Administrative Office will
assume responsibility for the Emergency
Services budget unit in FY 2014-15,
including overseeing the inter-related
functions of Risk Management and
Emergency Services. The Recommended
Budget and Organization Chart reflect this
reassignment.
The County Administrative Office will also
assume responsibility for the Animal
Control budget unit and Sutter Animal
Services Authority functions for the County.
The Recommended Budget and
Organization Chart reflect this reassignment.
During FY 2013-14, one Deputy County
Administrative Officer was appointed as the
Interim Director of this new General
Services Department, for a six-month
period. Therefore, the salary and related
benefits were reduced by $71,724 to reflect
this six-month temporary assignment. The
FY 2014-15 recommended budget reflects
this flexibly staffed position as fully funded,
yet filled at the lower Principal Analyst
level. The relative increase in cost for this
budget unit is primarily due to the
restoration of full-funding for this position.
The recommended budget reflects action
taken in FY 2013-14 to eliminate the vacant
Executive Assistant/Assistant Clerk of the
Board position and to add one Management
Assistant to the County Administrative
Officer position. This change is reflected in
the Position Allocation Schedule.
The budget continues to maintain the regular
Senior Analyst position as vacant and
unfunded. This position was first left vacant
and unfunded in FY 2010-11.
The recommended budget includes a rebudget
of $30,000 for assistance with the
implementation of the SunGard
Budget module, which has been deferred
for over three years pending completion of
the Personnel and Payroll modules.
There are no other significant changes
recommended for the County Administrative
Office budget.
This budget is recommended at $639,058.
The General Fund provides approximately
93.8% of the financing for this budget unit
and is decreased $57,722 (8.8%) compared to
FY 2013-14.
Audit Fees are recommended at $79,000 for
annual Independent Audit costs. This will be
the second year of a three-year contract.
The Professional and Special Service – Legal
line item is recommended at $110,000. The
Recommended Budget includes $100,000 for
one-time outside legal services related to
anticipated, pending and/or existing litigation
against the County. Funding will only be used
if pending or existing litigation requires the
use of outside services. It is recommended
that this one-time cost be offset with one-time
monies through a cancellation of Obligated
Fund Balance in the General Revenues budget
unit (1-209). As in prior years, $10,000 is
recommended to cover residual legal issues
related to the Golden State Water Company
litigation.
The Professional and Specialized Services
account is recommended at $140,000, and
includes $10,000 for the Management
Training program (formerly budgeted in the
Human Resources budget unit), the addition
of a Workforce Analytics Study anticipated to
be initiated in FY 2014-15, and general
contract services required in FY 2012-13.
The Contribution to Other Agencies account
continues to reflect the County’s contribution
to the Area 4 Agency on Aging (pursuant to a
current Joint Powers Agreement). This annual
payment wasmoved into the NDE budget unit
from the Subsidy Requests budget unit (7-
202) in the FY 2011-12 Adopted Budget.
The Contribution to Other Agencies account
also reflects the $52,000 annual contribution
to the Yuba Sutter Economic Development
Corporation, which was moved to the NDE
budget unit from the Subsidy Requests budget
unit (7-202) in FY 2013-14.
Intrafund Transfers include a negative $5,000
(essentially a revenue) in Intrafund
Rents/Leases related to the Farm Advisor’s
building lease. This account is budgeted each
year.
This budget is recommended at $94,779.
It is recommended that the costs associated
with this budget unit be funded with the
Cancellation of Obligated Fund Balance from
the Committed Fund Balance Designated for
Capital Projects (account #31265).
The estimate for the General Revenue category
is $32,465,847, which is an increase of
$553,069 (1.7%) compared to the FY 2013-14
Adopted Budget.
The increase is primarily due to an increase in
the amount of A-87 Overhead reimbursement
revenue that the General Fund receives from
non-General Fund departments (also referred
to as subvented funds) and outside agencies.
The General Fund has overall experienced a
reduction in A-87 reimbursements, due to
reductions that have been made over the past
several years to General Fund departments
whose costs are partially or wholly recouped
through the A-87 Cost Plan. However, this
budget reflects the recommendation to begin
charging the Welfare/Social Services Fund for
its respective A-87 costs. As a policy
decision, this cost has not been charged in the
past. It is staff’s recommendation that this
cost be recouped. The annual A-87 Cost Plan
is produced by the Auditor-Controller’s Office
pursuant to Federal regulation.
The General Revenue category remains
essentially the same as FY 2013-14, when the
reduction in A-87 Overhead is not included.
The County’s three major General Revenues
have traditionally been the property tax, the
sales tax, and the motor vehicle in-lieu
payments from the State. However,
significant changes occurred in FY 2004-05
regarding how two of these major revenue
streams, the sales tax and the motor vehicle
in-lieu (MVIL) payments, are received from
the State.
The voter approved Proposition 57 (The
Economic Recovery Bond Act, 2004),
implemented a set of transactions, also known
as the “Triple Flip,” whereby a share of
revenues that had previously appeared under
the Sales and Use Taxes account are now
shown in the related In-Lieu Local Sales and
Use Tax account. The amount that each
county receives for In-Lieu Local Sales and
Use Tax is provided each year by the State
Controller’s Office. This “temporary” shift of
revenues by the State is to last until all of the
revenue bonds issued by the State, pursuant to
Proposition 57, are paid off. The State is
currently contemplating repayment of these
bonds in FY 2016-17.
Prior to 2004, a primary source of revenue for
California counties was the motor vehicle inlieu.
Due to the voter approved Proposition 1A
(Protection of Local Government Revenues Act
of November 2004), the State now receives the
motor vehicle in-lieu revenues and have
“swapped” that revenue for property tax. That
revenue is budgeted in the Property Tax In-Lieu
- Vehicle License Fee account. The intent of
Prop 1A was to protect revenues collected by
local governments (cities, counties, and special
districts) from being transferred to the
California State government for statewide use.
This was a permanent change to the County-
State relationship regarding these revenues, and
the County will continue to receive Property
Tax revenues in lieu of MVIL. Property Tax In-
Lieu - Vehicle License Fee revenues are calculated each year by a formula determined by
the State Controller’s Office. It should be noted
that these In-Lieu Property Tax revenues are not
related to, nor should they in any way impact,
the amount received in the Property Tax -
Secured account.
For FY 2014-15, property tax revenues
(including secured, unsecured, and property
tax in lieu of Motor Vehicle License Fees) are
projected to be approximately $21.6 million.
This represents a net increase of $85,000, or
less than one-half of a percent, from the FY
2013-14 Adopted Budget, based on the initial
property tax roll estimate. The County
Administrative Officer and the Assessor
estimate that secured property tax revenue will
increase slightly for FY 2014-15 based on
recent market activity. It is anticipated that
current supplemental property tax revenue will
decrease slightly for FY 2014-15. All other
property tax related revenues are anticipated to
remain the same as FY 2013-14.
The budget for sales and use tax revenue,
including in-lieu revenue, is recommended at
$3.1 million. Sales tax based revenues
declined substantially in FY 2008-09 and FY
2009-10; however, the decline in sales tax
revenues appears to have leveled off starting
with FY 2011-12. The County Administrative
Office is projecting that revenue from Sales
and Use Tax will increase by $100,000 for FY
2014-15. The budget for In-Lieu Local Sales
and Use Tax is anticipated to remain the same
as FY 2013-14.
The County receives Franchise Fee revenue
from three sources: PG&E, Recology Yuba-
Sutter, and Comcast, with the majority of the
fee revenue coming from PG&E. Because the
PG&E franchise fee is tied to electric and gas
use, this revenue source fluctuates from year
to year. However, overall, Franchise Fee
revenue from PG&E has gradually declined
over the past three years. Total franchise fee
revenue is budgeted at $1.2 million, a decrease
of $300,000 as compared to FY 2013-14.
Revenue from Interest earned on monies held
by the general fund in the pooled treasury has
decreased substantially over the past four
years. This decrease is primarily due to the
combination of a decrease in the general fund
balances held in the pooled treasury and a
general decrease in the overall pooled treasury
interest rate.
It is recommended that $55,000 of rebate
funds received from the Centers for Medicare
& Medicaid Services (CMS) Retiree Drug
Subsidy Program (RDS) be budgeted for FY
2014-15. The County began receiving these
funds in FY 2006-07, but had not budgeted
the revenue prior to FY 2012-13 due to the
volatility in the annual amount received. The
balance of the CMS/RDS funds in the amount
of $8,100 is budgeted in the Human Resources
budget unit (1-401) to offset the cost of retiree
billing services.
The estimated available Fund Balance from
FY 2013-14 is just over $3.5 million. This
represents carry-forward monies generated
from on-going County operations which can
be, and need to be, used to fund on-going
County expenditures. This represents a
reduction of approximately $1.0 million over
the amount that was budgeted to be available
in the FY 2013-14 Recommended Budget.
It should be noted that the actual estimated
available Fund Balance will not be known
until the financial books of the County are
closed by the Auditor-Controller, typically in
October of each year, and it is likely that the actual fund balance will differ from what is
included in this recommendation. At this
time, it is anticipated that any change in Fund
Balance available that results from the closing
of the County books at year-end will be
adjusted to the Increases in Obligated Fund
Balance account, to be placed in Obligated
Fund Balance Designated for Capital Projects
in the final Adopted Budget.
The recommended General Fund
Contribution is $3,805,433, which is a
decrease of $160,858 (4.1%) compared to
FY 2013-14. As noted, this Unreimbursed
Cost represents the County share of all
recommended budgets in the Trial Court
Fund (0-014).
The recommended General Fund
contribution is $3,805,433, which is a
decrease of $160,858 (4.1%) compared to
FY 2013-14.
The recommended amount equals the
revenue that is required to meet the
Unreimbursed Costs of all the budget units
within the Trial Court Fund (0-014), which
include Sheriff’s Court Bailiffs (2-103),
Public Defender (2-106), Trial Court
Funding (2-109), Superior Court (2-112) and
Probation (2-304).
The recommended decrease in the General
Fund Contribution is primarily due to
reductions in the Probation budget unit.
The Revenue for this budget is
recommended at $21,096,445, which is an
increase of $656,984 (3.2%) compared to
FY 2013-14. The recommended General
Fund contribution is $14,196,445, which is
an increase of $376,984 (2.7%) compared to
FY 2013-14.
Proposition 172 revenue is estimated at
$6,900,000. Actual Proposition 172 receipts
have increased during FY 2013-14, leading
to a recommended increase of $280,000 in
FY 2014-15. It should be noted that the
increase in this revenue sources is not
sufficient to match the increase in costs in
this budget unit.
Therefore, the General Fund contribution to
the Public Safety fund is also recommended
to increase, by $376,984. The
recommended increase in the General Fund
contribution is primarily the result of increased costs in the County Jail, including
inmate medical costs.
This budget is recommended at
$14,196,445, which is an increase of
$376,984 (2.7%) compared to FY 2013-14.
The General Fund contribution to the Public
Safety Fund reflects the total of the
recommended Unreimbursed Costs of all
budgets within the Public Safety Fund.
The recommended increase in the General
Fund contribution to the Public Safety Fund
is primarily the result of increased cost in
the County Jail, including inmate medical
costs.
This budget is recommended at $351,139,
which is an increase of $31,419 (9.8%)
compared to FY 2013-14. This budget unit is
within the Public Safety fund; however, it is
considered to be funded primarily by the
General Fund, which provides 27.5% of the
financing for this budget unit. This is an
increase of $38,297 (65.7%) compared to FY
2014-15.
The relative increase in this budget is related
to an overestimation of EMPG funds that
would be received in the FY 2013-14 budget.
For FY 2014-15, the Emergency Operations
Manager position is recommended to be
restored to a 1.0 FTE allocation.
Based upon updated calculations, it has been
determined that funding the position as an
80% position (0.8 FTE) results in the most
beneficial cost to revenue ratio for the General
Fund. Thus, a 0.8 FTE Emergency Operations
Manager allocation results in a $6,710General
Fund reduction as compared to a 0.5 FTE
position. This also benefits the County as the
Emergency Operations Manager will now
have an average of 12 additional hours per
week to perform emergency services
functions.
The remaining twenty percent (0.2 FTE) of the
Emergency Operations Manager’s 1.0 FTE
allocation for FY 2014-15 will be dedicated to
managing identified countywide safety efforts,
which overlap with countywide emergency
management and communication duties. The
County is eligible for reimbursement for these
duties, and the associated revenue is reflected
in the Refund account.
It is also recommended that this function be
moved under the County Administrative
Office, beginning in FY 2014-15, for the
purpose of overseeing countywide emergency
management and safety-related efforts. In the
event of an emergency, the County
Administrative Officer, or his designee, is
responsible for managing the Emergency
Operations Center.
The recommended revenue is $3,576,823,
which is a decrease of $3,056,045 (46.1%)
compared to FY 2013-14. Other Charges is
recommended at $0 due to AB-85 and the
cancelation of the pass-through of CMSP
funds.
The recommended budget for the MVIL
portion of Health Realignment revenue is
recommended at $2,645,242, which is a
decrease of $1,698,983 (39.1%) compared to
FY 2013-14. In March of 2014 AB-85 came
into effect, which redirected how sales tax
and MVIL will be distributed as well as
ceased the pass-through of CMSP funds,
leading to the reduction in MVIL revenues.
The MVIL portion of the Health
Realignment revenue is first deposited in the
General Fund and is then transferred to this
budget unit.
The recommended amount for the sales tax
portion of the Health Realignment revenue,
which, by statute, is first deposited to the
Health Realignment Fund (Special Revenue
Fund 0-247), is recommended at $0, due to
the AB-85 redirection of sales tax and
MVIL.
The Realignment revenue amounts are set
each year by the State Controller’s Office.
It should be noted that these budgeted
figures are subject to change once revenue
estimate information becomes available
from the State Controller’s office later in the
year. We will monitor the MVIL
Realignment revenues and how AB-85 may
affect this budget unit throughout the
coming fiscal year, and come to your Board
with changes if necessary.
This budget is recommended at $3,576,823.
The County’s contribution to the Health
Fund decreases by $59,927 (1.1%)
compared to FY 2013-14.
MVIL Realignment revenues are
recommended at $2,645,242, which is a
decrease of $1,698,983 (39.1%) compared to
FY 2013-14. In March of 2014 AB-85 came
into effect, which redirected how sales tax
and MVIL will be distributed as well as
ceased the pass-through of CMSP funds. We will monitor the MVIL Realignment
revenues and how they may affect this
budget unit throughout the coming fiscal
year, and come to your Board with changes
if necessary.
The recommended revenue is $4,134,942,
which is an increase of $1,344,568 (48.2%)
compared to FY 2013-14. This increase is
due primarily to unreimbursed cost increased
across the Board for Welfare budget units in
FY 2014-15.
The recommended amount for the sales tax
portion of the Social Services Realignment
Revenues (SSRR), which, by statute, is first
deposited to the Welfare/Social Services
Realignment Fund, is recommended at $769,372. This is a decrease of $1,395,343
(64.4%) and is also directly attributable to the
increase in unreimbursed cost of the budget
units within the Welfare/Social Services fund.
The recommended budget for the MVIL
portion of the SSRR is $2,916,570, which is
an increase of $2,739,911 over FY 2012-13.
The Motor Vehicle In-lieu (MVIL) portion of
the SSRR is first deposited in the General
Fund and is then transferred to this budget
unit.
In March of 2014 AB-85 came into effect,
which redirected how sales tax and MVIL
would be distributed. In total Welfare/Social
Services fund is expecting an increase of
$1,344,568. We will monitor these revenues
and how they may affect this budget unit
throughout the coming fiscal year, and
come to your Board with changes if
necessary.
The SSRR amounts are set each year by the
State Controller’s Office. It should be noted
these budgeted figures are subject to change
once revenue estimate information becomes
available from the State Controller’s office
later in the year. 
The recommended budget is $3,365,570,
which is a $2,739,911 increase over FY
2013-14. The Unreimbursed Cost of this
budget unit represents the County share of all
recommended budgets in the Welfare/Social
Services Fund. In March of 2014 AB-85 came into effect,
which redirected how sales tax and MVIL
would be distributed. We will monitor the
MVIL Realignment revenues and how they
may affect this budget unit throughout the
coming fiscal year, and come to your Board
with changes if necessary.
The recommended Appropriation for
Contingency is $550,000. This is the same as
FY 2013-14.
This budget is recommended at $794,901.
The General Fund provides 97.3% of the
financing for this budget unit and is
decreased by $130,811 (14.5%) compared to
FY 2013-14. A portion of the costs for this
budget unit are recouped from outside and
subvented funds through the annual A-87
cost plan.
This recommended budget reflects the
elimination of the Human Resources
Director position. It is recommended that
the Human Resources function of the
County be reassigned to the County
Administrative Office for FY 2014-15. The
Director position had historically been
included in both the Human Resources (1-401)
budget unit (80%) and the Workers’
Compensation (4-594) budget unit (20%).
There is no recommendation to allocate
County Administrative staff to the Human
Resources budget unit. However, 10% of
the County Administrative Officer position
has been included in the Workers’
Compensation budget unit to reflect
oversight of the transition to the Trindel
Insurance Fund. The organizational
structure of the departments will be further
evaluated during FY 2014-15.
It is recommended that the Extra Help
budget remain defunded for FY 2014-15.
The Department is closed to the public
during the noon hour (from 12:30 p.m. to
1:30 p.m.) due to the loss of extra-help front
desk assistance in FY 2012-13.
Funding of $70,000 is recommended in the
Professional/Specialized Services account to
reflect the need for an Integrated Disability
Management Program and a consultant to
conduct a Workforce Analysis. The need
for a contract labor negotiator is also
anticipated in FY 2014-15 and included in
this budgeted amount. The Department has
also experienced an increased need for
outside investigative services related to
employee relations issues. The Department
anticipates that this trend will continue, and
that those departments for whom the
investigations are being conducted be
required to fund the cost of the outside
investigator.
This budget is recommended at $56,344
(when Intrafund revenue is included). This
results in a decrease of $9,915 (15%)
compared to FY 2013-14.
The County is no longer paying for Airport
insurance. On April 22, 2014 the Board
entered into a Management Agreement with
the Sutter Buttes Regional Aviation
Association for the provision of day to day
operations and management services at the
Sutter County Airport, which includes
maintaining their own insurance.
There are no other significant changes
recommended in this budget unit. Because
this budget unit reflects only the cost of
insurance premiums which are provided to
the County by the carrier, there is no
practical ability for the County to affect
budget reductions in this budget unit in the
short-term.
This budget is recommended at $510,661.
The FY 2014-15 General Fund cost for this
budget unit is $320,243, or 62.7% of the
total budget. The General Fund’s cost for
this budget unit has decreased by $225,232
as compared to FY 2013-14.
The recommended budget reflects a
decrease of $129,251 in salaries and related
benefits, reflecting a reduction in the
number of Sutter County employees. SASA
shelter and field services are staffed with a
combination of Yuba City employees and
Sutter County employees, pursuant to the
Employee Services Agreement. There are
currently three Sutter County employees
under this Agreement. The number of
employees under the Agreement will be
reduced each time a Sutter County employee
leaves service for any reason, and the
position will change to a Yuba City position.
The contracted employee costs are
reimbursed to Sutter County by Yuba City. Yuba City provides Workers’ Compensation
benefits for all employees including the
employees contracted from Sutter County.
However, because Workers’ Compensation
costs are allocated to all Sutter County
departments utilizing a formula that includes
a 10-year experience factor, there is a
residual cost for the coverage provided in
prior years by Sutter County while it acted
as lead agency. This residual cost ($97,469
for FY 2014-15) will be borne by Sutter
County alone and is reflected in this
recommended budget. This residual amount
should decrease each year for 10 years and
will eventually reach zero.
This budget consists of the following
primary expenses and related revenues.
 Contribution to Other Agencies,
recommended at $200,000, reflecting
Sutter County’s 22% share of the SASA
operating budget. Sutter County’s share
of cost for FY 2014-15 is based on
population, and has been reduced from
25% in prior years. As of this writing,
the Sutter Animal Services Authority,
with the City of Yuba City acting as lead
agency, has not finalized its operating
budget for FY 2014-15. Therefore, the
recommended Contribution to Yuba City
for the County’s share of SASA costs is
based on the best estimates available.
Should the final recommended budget
change significantly, a revised
recommendation will be presented to the
Board of Supervisors for consideration
and approval.
 The residual Intrafund Overhead (A-87)
Cost of $20,534, not shared by the
SASA jurisdictions. This item was
removed from the shared SASA budget
in FY 2011-12 and will eventually be
reduced to zero (during FY 2015-16).
 The Yuba City Animal Control revenue
line item, $190,418, which reflects the
actual cost of employees contracted to
Yuba City.
All other line items in this budget unit were
reduced to zero in FY 2013-14, with the
exception of minor carry-over costs.
The General Fund cost for this budget unit
will reduce each year to reflect the reduction
of residual costs and any changes that may
occur to the agreement for employee
services with the City of Yuba City. At
some time in the future, this budget unit will
reflect only Sutter County’s proportionate
share of the approved SASA operating
budget.
This budget is recommended at $707,776.
This is a 1.1% decrease as compared to FY
2013-14.
The Liability Insurance budget unit operates
as an ISF and must balance revenues to
expenditures within the fund.
Recommended budget increases result in an
$81,446 (32%) increase in the Interfund
Liability Insurance ISF premium charges to
County Departments as compared to FY
2013-14. The amount, budgeted in the
Interfund Liability Insurance ISF line item,
reflects the total charges made to County
departments for liability insurance premiums
and requirements to maintain the liability
claims reserve. Therefore, the increase in
this account equals the amount that has been
increased in County department budgets for
FY 2014-15.
The Board of Supervisors has a funding
policy that program assets be maintained
between the 75% and 90% confidence level.
In prior years program assets were projected
to be in excess of the 90% confidence level;
however, as of June 30, 2014, the Liability
ISF has sufficient assets to meet the funding
guidelines and not exceed the County’s
funding policy.
The CSAC Excess Insurance Authority
standard states that based on the actuarial
recommendations, the members should
maintain reserves and make funding
contributions equal to or exceeding the
expected losses and a reasonable margin for
contingencies. The recommended amount to
be set aside in FY 2014-15 for future claims
payable is $200,000. With this
recommendation, the County will continue
to have sufficient funds set aside in the
liability claims reserve to cover future
claims payable.
This budget is recommended at $2,397,091,
which is an 8.1% increase over FY 2013-14.
Because the net costs of this fund are
allocated to all County departments,
including General Fund departments, a
significant effort has been made to contain
costs in the Workers’ Compensation Fund.
Over 80% of the cost of the County’s
Workers’ Compensation program is driven
by insurance premium costs. Initial
insurance premium estimates received from
the carrier indicate an increase over the prior
year budgeted amount, driven primarily by
escalating workers’ compensation insurance
rates from the underwriting markets.
However, the County was notified that it
will receive a dividend from the carrier
based on pooled savings, which will be
applied in the coming year. Therefore, the
recommendation for the FY 2014-15
insurance premium reflects this estimated
dividend as a reduction to the quoted
insurance premium costs. Nonetheless,
insurance premium costs are anticipated to increase by approximately $226,000
(12.5%) over the prior year budgeted
amount, and by approximately $250,000
(14%) over what was actually paid in FY
2013-14.
This recommended budget reflects the
elimination of the Human Resources
Director position. It is recommended that
the Human Resources function of the
County be reassigned to the County
Administrative Office for FY 2014-15. The
Director position had historically been
included in both the Human Resources (1-
401) budget unit (80%) and the Workers’
Compensation (4-594) budget unit (20%).
Therefore, 20% of the Human Resources
Director position has been removed from the
position allocation schedule, and 10% of the
County Administrative Officer position is
now included in the Workers’ Compensation
budget unit to reflect oversight of the
transition to the Trindel Insurance Fund.
The organizational structure of the
departments will be further evaluated during
FY 2014-15.
The recommended budget eliminates one
filled part-time (0.6 FTE) Safety
Coordinator position. This position was
reduced from a full-time position to a parttime
position in FY 2011-12 in an effort to
contain cost increases in the Workers’
Compensation program.
This budget is recommended at $1,116,081,
which is a decrease of $123,041 (9.9%)
compared to FY 2013-14. The General
Fund provides 97.1% of the financing for
this budget unit and is decreased by $19,041
(1.6%) compared to FY 2013-14 once the
$100,000 one-time expense for legal
services, now contained in the Non-
Departmental Expenses (1-103) budget unit,
is discounted. A portion of the costs for this
budget unit are recouped from outside and
subvented funds through the annual A-87
cost plan. The recommended budget includes the
elimination of one filled 0.5 FTE Legal
Secretary II position. This elimination
results in a General Fund cost reduction of
$47,415. However, $3,500 in Extra Help
staffing is recommended to fund front office
coverage during administrative staff
absences.
Transportation and Travel is maintained at
$6,000. The Department must keep a
minimum appropriation for Transportation
and Travel for professional staff to attend
trainings where they receive continuing
education credits, as this is the most
economical means to meet licensing
requirements.
The impact of these changes will continue to
be monitored.
This budget is recommended at $986,698.
The General Fund provides 61.6% of the
financing for the Department, and is
increased by $32,809 (5.7%) compared to
FY 2013-14.
This recommendation reflects the continued
decision to hold vacant and unfunded one Treasurer-Deputy Collector position that
was initially frozen and unfunded in FY
2009-10, and maintains the reduction of one
Treasurer-Collector Deputy position to halftime
(0.5 FTE) originally reduced in FY
2011-12.
This budget is recommended at $218,935.
The General Fund provides 53.4% of the
financing for the Department, and has
increased by $3,420 (3.0%) compared to FY
2013-14.
The Office of Revenue Collections division
is staffed by two full-time Treasurer-
Collector Deputy positions and is allocated a
portion of the Assistant Treasurer-Tax
Collector position for management
oversight. The Department will continue to
hold vacant and unfunded a third Treasurer-
Collector Deputy position that was originally
frozen and unfunded in FY 2010-11.
This budget is recommended at $825,590,
which is an increase of $50,641 (6.5%)
compared to FY 2013-14. The General
Fund provides 20.1% of the financing for
this budget unit and is decreased $34,840
(17.4%) when compared to FY 2013-14. A
portion of the costs for this budget is
recouped from outside and subvented funds
through the annual A-87 cost plan.
This budget unit reflects Intra/Interfund
Administration Service revenues, which
represent the provision of administrative
support service to the other budget units in
this Department. Before FY 2013-14, these
services were provided by the Public Works
Department and allocated and billed in the
same manner.
Approved during FY 2013-14, the
recommended budget includes the addition
of a 0.5 FTE position and the transfer of a
1.0 FTE position from the Development Services Department, for a total of 7.5 FTE
positions. Intrafund Administration
Services revenue is shown as a negative
expense, and is recommended at ($268,637),
which is an increase of $70,878 compared to
FY 2013-14. This reflects revenues from
the remaining General Fund budget units in
the Department for administrative support.
Similarly, the addition of Interfund
Administration-Miscellaneous Department
revenue in the amount of $342,156 reflects
the administrative services provided by this
budget unit to the Information Technology
ISF and the Fleet ISF.
The Sutter County Regional Airport budget
unit was included in the General Services
Department until the Sutter Buttes Regional
Aviation Association (SBRAA) was
contracted to provide management services.
The contract was approved and will begin
on July 1, 2014. The remaining costs for
that budget unit are associated with
Development Services; therefore the Airport
budget unit is to be transferred to that
department for FY 2014-15. 
This budget is recommended at $286,408,
which is an increase of $16,434 (6.1%)
compared to FY 2013-14. The General
Fund provides 90.6% of the financing for
this budget unit and is increased $16,434
(6.8%) for FY 2014-15.
This budget is recommended at $3,436,041,
which is an increase of $422,934 (14.0%) as
compared to FY 2013-14. The General
Fund provides 85.1% of the financing for
this budget unit and is increased by
$363,576 (14.2%) compared to FY 2013-14.
A portion of the costs for this budget unit
are recouped from outside and sub-vented
funds through the annual A-87 Cost Plan.
The increase is primarily due to the
implementation of the Chevron Energy
Savings and Infrastructure Upgrade project.
Chevron project costs for the Solar Array at
the Sutter County Airport are reflected in the
Building Maintenance budget unit, with an
anticipated reduction in Utilities expense.
Both costs are distributed to County
departments through the annual A-87 Cost
Plan. The share of cost from outside
funding sources will be recouped through
the Cost Plan process.
Capital Assets are recommended as follows:
$66,750 for two replacement ¾-ton utility
bed pickups ($33,375 each)
$29,575 for one replacement ¾-ton pickup
Building Maintenance
Professional and Specialized Services are
recommended to include only known
recurring contract work such as elevator
maintenance, fire extinguisher maintenance,
pest control services and card access system
repairs and monitoring. No contingency
funds are budgeted for unanticipated work.
Additional funding would be requested if
additional services are required.
Maintenance of Structure & Improvements
is recommended at $71,500 to cover only
those planned maintenance projects not
budgeted in Plant Acquisition (#1801).
Grounds Maintenance
In FY 2011-12, the permanent grounds
maintenance staff was reduced from four to
three positions. This is recommended to
continue for FY 2014-15 with no assistance
from Extra Help employees.
This budget is recommended at $111,763.
The General Fund does not provide funding
for this budget unit. All funding is provided
by the water/wastewater systems maintained
by the Water/Wastewater Operator position.
This budget is recommended at $21,608,
which is an increase of $178 (0.8%)
compared to FY 2013-14. All funding is
provided through fines and interest.
The Special Department Expense account
reflects expenses related to programs, events
and donations such as:
 Pheasants;
 Support of duck egg projects;
 Yuba Sutter Fair booth;
 Donations of equipment to the Game
Wardens; and
 Donations to support special events,
programs and projects.
The Youth Programs account reflects
expenses specifically tied to youth
educational programs, events and donations
such as:
 Youth fishing derbies;
 Salmon aquarium programs;
 School educational programs and
field trips; and
 Shady Creek Outdoor School
scholarships.
This budget is recommended at $1,483,114,
which is an increase of $1,658 (0.1%)
compared to FY 2013-14. The Fleet
Management budget unit operates as an ISF
and must balance revenue to expenditure
within the fund.
Compared to FY 2013-14, the recommended
budget reflects a $25,886 (1.8%) net
decrease in the three Interfund revenue
accounts used to charge County customers
for services provided: Interfund Fuel & Oil,
Interfund Vehicle Maintenance, and
Interfund Fleet Administration.
Due to the volatility in the price of fuel, it is
difficult to accurately estimate future cost.
Based on current fuel prices and reduced
fuel use across departments, the
Recommended Budget for FY 2014-15
includes $490,916 for the purchase of fuel
for the majority of County departments.
This represents a 3.7% decrease compared
to FY 2013-14. Additional funding may be
required if major prolonged upward
fluctuations in fuel prices are experienced.
This budget is recommended at $3,951,106.
The Information Technology budget unit
operates as an ISF and must balance
revenues to expenditures within the fund.
The recommended budget results in a
$222,783 (6.7%) decrease in Interfund
Information Technology charges to County
departments compared to FY 2013-14. The
Interfund Information Technology account
represents the total of all charges made to
County departments for Information
Technology services. Therefore, the
reduction of $222,783 equals the amount
that has been reduced in County department
budgets for FY 2014-15.
The A-87 Cost Plan is provided by the
Auditor-Controller’s Office each year. For
FY 2014-15, the Information Technology
Division’s Interfund Overhead (A-87)
charges are recommended at $93,151 which
is an increase of $22,596 (32.0%) compared
to FY 2013-14.
Capital Assets are recommended at $50,000
for the purchase of a replacement virtual
server.
This budget is recommended at $647,500.
The recommendation includes one project
that was authorized in prior years and is
continuing in FY 2014-15, as well as eight
new projects for FY 2014-15.
It is recommended that immediate
authorization be given to the Development
Services Director to continue work on the
prior year project that is being re-budgeted
and both Development Services and General
Services departments to commence work on
the new projects, without waiting for the
adoption of the final budget resolution.
It should also be noted that a significant
amount of work will continue through FY
2014-15 for the Chevron Energy Savings
and Infrastructure Upgrade Project. This
countywide project was approved by the
Board of Supervisors in March of 2014.
The annual equipment lease payment for this
project has been included in the appropriate
budget units for those departments
benefitting from the project.
This budget unit was previously managed by
the Development Services Department
(formerly Public Works Department), and
with this Recommended Budget is being
reassigned to the General Services
Department. Both Departments concur with
this recommendation.
Continuing Projects
The Development Services Director and
County Administrative Officer are
recommending that one previously
authorized project be re-budgeted in FY
2014-15. This continuing project totals
$56,000, and is a General Fund cost. Recommended New Projects
The following chart summarizes the eight
new projects recommended for approval,
and indicates the funding source for each
project. The total of the newly requested
projects for FY 2014-15 is $591,500.
This budget is recommended at $34,195,
which is an increase of $14,267 (71.6%)
compared to FY 2013-14. This budget unit
does not receive any funding from the
General Fund.
This budget is recommended at $136,331,
which is a decrease of $16,130 (10.6%)
compared to FY 2013-14. The General
Fund provides 72.9% of the financing for
this budget unit and is decreased by $16,130
(14.0%) for FY 2014-15.
This budget is recommended at $30,339,
which is a decrease of $8,934 (22.7%)
compared to FY 2013-14. The General
Fund provides 78.2% of the financing for
this budget unit and is decreased by $534
(2.2%) for FY 2014-15.
The Recommended Budget includes $8,475
in Intrafund A-87 Cost Plan Building
Maintenance charges, a decrease of $7,241.
The Cost Plan is developed each year by the
Auditor-Controller’s Office and reflects
Building Maintenance charges based on
actual costs from FY 2012-13, the second
year of operations for the Hall.
The Recommended Budget also includes
estimated rental revenues of $6,600, a
reduction of $8,400 in FY 2013-14, to more
closely reflect the actual rentals reserved
during FY 2013-14. The Community
Memorial Museum budget unit is estimated
to receive $2,864 through the Intrafund
Museum Rental Revenue account, which
represents half of the net rental revenue (less
rental expenses). The remaining half of the
net rental revenue is returned to the General
Fund to repay the General Fund loan used to
construct the facility.
This budget is recommended at $415,440,
which is a decrease of $18,541 (4.3%)
compared to FY 2013-14.
The $65,925 unreimbursed cost, which is
decreased by $3,289 (4.8%) from FY 2013-
14, represents the Health Department’s share
of the Human Services-Administration
budget. This Unreimbursed Cost is, in
concept, partially funded by the General
Fund through the General Fund’s
contribution to the Health Fund.
This budget is recommended at $5,720,800
with an unreimbursed cost of $2,752,089,
which is a decrease of $51,591 (1.8%)
compared to FY 2013-14. The majority of this
cost is offset by 1991 Realignment revenue.
The County has a Maintenance of Effort
(MOE), or minimum funding requirement, as a
condition of receiving 1991 Realignment
funding from the State. Sutter County’s MOE
is $674,240. The County’s MOE contribution
is reflected in the Health – General budget unit
(4-110) and the Health – County Share budget
unit (4-112).
Revenue from the Lease Agreement with
Peach Tree Healthcare, Inc. for leasing of the
Health building and the equipment/fixtures is
reduced by $35,760. The equipment and
fixtures were not new at the time of the lease
and are now fully depreciated. The Board of
Supervisors approved this change in the Lease
Agreement in July of 2013; however, this
change was not reflected in the FY 2013-14
Budget.
In the latter half of FY 2013-14, Colusa
County discontinued the Personal Services
Agreement which provided limited services
of the Sutter County Health Officer to serve
as County Health Officer for Colusa County
as well; decreasing revenues by $74,860.
The County had been sharing the Health
Officer position with Colusa County since
FY 2010-11, with Colusa County
responsible for 20% and Sutter County responsible for the remaining 80%. Loss of
this contract shifts this cost to the General
Fund.
It is recommended to defund one vacant
Account Clerk I/II position for FY 2014-15, as
well as to eliminate one vacant Nutritional
Assistant position in the WIC program due to a
decrease in caseload.
Funding for one vacant Public Health Nurse II
/ Social Services Worker III position has been
removed from the budget recommendation, as
it was in FY 2013-14. The Department will
continue to work on a revised Medi-Cal
Administrative Activities (MAA) program
plan. Pending approval of funding and the
revised MMA plan, it is anticipated that the
Department will request the position be
refunded.
In addition, one vacant 0.5 FTE Health
Program Specialist position is defunded as
grant funding for this position is not available.
Of the remaining 51.18 FTE positions
contained in the Health Department budget,
28.78 FTE positions are directly grant funded.
This budget is recommended at $2,613,956,
which is an increase of $276,654 (11.8%)
compared to FY 2013-14. Jail Medical
Services are 86.5% funded by the
General Fund and 13.5% funded by AB109
for FY 2014-15.
Support & Care of Persons expense reflects
direct expenditures related to the
hospitalizations and other outside care of
inmates. This line item is recommended at
$700,000, reflecting an increase of $170,000,
or 32%, over the FY 2013-14 Adopted Budget.
These expenditures will be monitored closely
over the coming year.
The cost of providing medical services to the
Sutter County Jail is, in effect, transferred to
the Jail budget unit (2-301), within the Public
Safety fund (0015), through the recording of
an Interfund Jail Medical transfer. This
transfer essentially transfers the unreimbursed
cost of the Jail Medical Services program from
the Health Fund to the Public Safety fund. The
General Fund covers all unreimbursed costs in
the Public Safety fund.
This budget is recommended at $644,111, with
a net unreimbursed cost of $619,111, which is
a decrease of $5,047 (0.8%) compared to FY
2013-14.
The County is currently in a multi-year
contract with Bi-County Ambulance Services
for indigent medical transportation. The
annual cost for these services is $26,400.
The County Share in the EMS Agency is
recommended at $50,766. The anticipated
cost for participation in this joint powers
agreement is based on California State
Department of Finance projections for the
population of Sutter County. This cost is
partially offset with a transfer in from the
Emergency Medical Services Special Revenue
Fund (0-252), in the amount of $25,000.
This budget continues to reflect the
participation fee of $188,781 set by legislation
for the County to participate in the CMSP.
This participation fee was not eliminated with
Health Realignment and SB 85.
The budget also includes $378,164 to be
transferred to the Environmental Health budget
unit (2-725).
This budget is recommended at $280,848,
which is the same as FY 2013-14. This
budget unit receives a portion of its financing
from the General Fund, with the balance of the County’s share of cost met by a transfer in of
Welfare/Social Services 1991 Realignment
funding.
At this time, the State has not determined the
amount of its contribution to the Sutter
County CCS Program for FY 2014-15. As
mentioned above, in the past, as a policy item,
the County has budgeted an amount in excess
of the MOE in order to meet the potential
demand for service, which can be very
volatile. This budget request for $210,368 is
consistent with the Board of Supervisors’ past
policy in this area and is the same as the prior
year’s Adopted Budget. However, the Board
could opt to reduce this budget request to the
minimum MOE of $154,465, to match a
potential reduced State contribution. At this
time it is unknown whether State contribution
will match the amount appropriated over the
MOE.
This budget is recommended at $168,902,
which is an increase of $6,882 (4.2%)
compared to FY 2013-14.
This budget is recommended at $26,672,230,
which is an increase of $2,313,181 (9.5%)
compared to FY 2013-14.
This budget unit receives no financing from
the County General Fund. The sources of
funding for Sutter-Yuba Mental Health
Services are shown in Figure 1. Mental
Health’s funding history is shown graphically
in Figure 2.
The increase in total cost is largely due to
increased personnel costs and an increased
Appropriation for Contingency.
It is recommended to purchase two passenger
vehicles for this budget unit. Mini-vans are
used by the Mental Health Department
primarily to transport clients.
It is recommended to add one flexibly-staffed
Mental Health Therapist I/II/III position and
one Account Clerk III position.
Additionally, it is recommended to eliminate
one vacant part-time contract employee
physician position with funding split between
Mental Health’s two budget units (0.4 FTE in
4-102 and 0.1 FTE in 4-104) and add one 0.5
FTE contract employee psychiatrist position
funded entirely in budget unit 4-102.
Mental Health requests that all of these actions
be effective July 1, 2014. It should also be
noted that two limited-term positions, a
flexibly-staffed Psychiatric Technician/
Psychiatric LVN and an Intervention
Counselor I, approved by the Board during FY
2012-13, were deleted from the position
allocation schedule in FY 2013-14 mid-year
because the conditions for ending the limited
terms of the positions had been met. It remains SYMHS’ objective to keep the
Mental Health budget and the Mental Health
Services Act budget in balance and to fully
utilize all available funding in a fashion most
advantageous to our counties.
This budget is recommended at $9,423,732, a
decrease of $212,239 (2.2%) compared to FY
2013-14. This decrease is primarily due to
completion of the initial phases of the EHR
project. MHSA program expenses are funded
by revenue from the State and from the Federal
share of reimbursement for services claimed to
Medi-Cal. This budget unit receives no
financing from the General Fund. See Figures
1 and 2 in the Mental Health (4-102) budget
narrative for information on Mental Health
funding sources and history.
It is recommended to purchase one passenger
vehicle, a mini-van, for this budget unit.
It is recommended to add one Resource
Specialist position for the Prevention and
Early Intervention Program. PEI program has
been difficult to manage because the workload
has been divided among 19 people, with 18 of
these positions funded only in small part by
PEI. Most of their time is spent performing
other clinical functions within Mental Health.
This position would replace 8 of these
fractional positions within PEI. If approved,
this position would be recruited as bi-lingual
(Spanish), in order to improve our ability to
reach out to this under-served community. SYMHS requests that this position be effective
July 1, 2014.
Additionally, it is recommended to eliminate
one vacant part-time contract employee
physician position with funding split between
Mental Health’s two budget units (0.4 FTE in
4-102 and 0.1 FTE in 4-104).
It should also be noted that one limited-term
position, a flexibly-staffed Psychiatric
Technician/ Psychiatric LVN, approved by the
Board during FY 2012-13, was deleted from
the position allocation schedule in FY 2013-14
because the conditions for ending the limited
term of the position had been met.
Additionally during FY 2013-14, there was the
addition of two Mental Health Therapist
I/II/III positions, one Intervention Counselor
I/II position funded with Innovation funds, and
one Mental Health Worker I position to the
Wellness and Recovery Program.
There is a budgeted decrease in State Mental
Health Medi-Cal of $65,750. These are Federal
funds for reimbursement for certain costs
associated with Medi-Cal administration. This
decrease results from a federally-driven change
in the methodology for determining these costs.
This budget is recommended at $20,874,667
which is an increase of $469,860 (2.3%)
compared to FY 2013-14. The
Welfare/Social Services fund as a whole
receives $449,000 in financing from the
General Fund in order to meet the County’s
Maintenance of Effort (MOE) for receipt of
CalWORKs and related Realignment
funding.
It is recommended that one (1) full-time
Staff Services Analyst I/II position be
added, with an effective date of July 1,
2014, to handle the increased analytical
duties related to the implementation of the
ACA.
Capital Assets are recommended at $21,500
for the purchase of one mid-sized sedan to
replace an aging vehicle.
During FY 2011-12, Public Safety
Realignment was implemented, which
realigned the responsibility for many
programs from the State to counties.
Because of this shift in funding, Sutter
County was mandated to establish the
County Local Revenue Fund 2011 (0-140).
For FY 2012-13, the Social Services
Realignment Fund 2011 (0-245) was
established to transfer funds from the
County Local Revenue Fund 2011 to the
operating budgets of the Welfare and Social
Services Division. The shift in funding
simply changed the flow of funding from the
State to the County without affecting the
overall amount of funding for programs.
The County Local Revenue Fund 2011 and
the Social Services Realignment Fund 2011
are discussed in greater detail in their own
budget narrative.
This budget is recommended at $235,086,
which is an increase of $1,165 (0.5%)
compared to FY 2013-14. The General Fund
provides 62.6% of the funding for this
budget unit.
This budget is recommended at $1,763,974,
which is an increase of $59,652 (3.5%)
compared to FY 2013-14. This increase
represents the inflation factor of 3.5% as
part of the implementation of SB 1036,
which established an MOE for each county’s
IHSS expenses. The County’s MOE is met
with Welfare/Social Services 1991
Realignment funds (Fund 0-248). Any costs
over the MOE amount are paid by the State.
The General Fund does not provide any
financing to this budget unit.
This budget is recommended at $9,983,192,
which is an increase of $475,448 (5.0%)
compared to FY 2013-14.
The 2013-14 State budget passed by the
Legislature includes funding to provide a
five percent grant increase effective March
1, 2014. AB 85 amended the Welfare and
Institutions Code Section 17600.10(a)(5)
that requires counties to establish a new
account wherein funds for the 5% grant
increase will be deposited. The five percent
increase will be funded through the
redirection of 1991 realignment general
growth revenues from Social Services and
Health to a new 1991 subaccount created for
this purpose. Counties will not have a share
of cost for grant increases provided from
funding in the new subaccount.
Also effective FY 2013-14 the State has
started remitting SB1041 TANF child
support collections pass-through funds to the
County.
The General Fund does not provide any
financing to this budget unit. The County’s
share of cost is met with Welfare/Social
Services 1991 Realignment funds (Fund 0-
248).
As in FY 2013-14, the State’s share of
TANF costs, which is realized as revenue by
the County, flows through the County Local
Revenue Fund 2011 (0-140) as opposed to
being directly received by the Division
through the Welfare/Social Services Fund as
has occurred in the past. The County Local
Revenue Fund 2011 is discussed in greater
detail in its own budget narrative.
This budget is recommended at $4,758,228
which is an increase of $733,056 (18.2%)
compared to FY 2013-14. The General
Fund does not provide any financing to this
budget unit. The County’s share of cost is
met with Welfare/Social Services 1991
Realignment funds (Fund 0-248).
The State’s share of Foster Care costs,
which is realized as revenue by the County,
flows from the County Local Revenue Fund
2011 (0-140) through the Social Services
Realignment Fund 2011 (0-245) as opposed
to being directly received by the Division
through the Welfare/Social Services Fund as
has occurred in the past. The County Local
Revenue Fund 2011 is discussed in greater
detail in its own budget narrative.
This budget is recommended at $14,800.
There is no change from the amount
budgeted in FY 2013-14. The General Fund
does not provide any financing to this
budget unit. This budget unit is 100%
federally funded.
This budget is recommended at $4,879,788
which is an increase of $329,592 (7.2%)
compared to FY 2013-14. The General
Fund does not provide any financing to this
budget unit. The County’s share of cost is
met with Welfare/Social Services 1991
Realignment funds (Fund 0-248).
The State’s share of Adoption costs, which
is realized as revenue by the County, flows
from the County Local Revenue Fund 2011
(0-140) through the Social Services
Realignment Fund 2011 (0-245) as opposed
to being directly received by the Division
through the Welfare/Social Services Fund as
has occurred in the past. The County Local
Revenue Fund 2011 is discussed in greater
detail in its own budget narrative.
This budget is recommended at $67,728,
which is a decrease of $3,412 (4.8%)
compared to FY 2013-14. The General Fund
provides 78.5% of the financing for this
budget unit.

This budget is recommended at $2,990,638,
which is a decrease of 4.6% compared to FY
2013-14. This budget unit does not receive
any funding from the General Fund. All
funding is provided through State and Federal
sources as set forth above.
As in prior years, this budget continues to
recommend that the Chief Child Support
Attorney position remain vacant and unfunded.
It is recommended that one vacant Child
Support Specialist position be defunded and
held vacant in FY 2014-15. This position
was previously held by a Child Support
Specialist II that has been promoted. Current
workload allows this position to remain vacant.
Department management has conducted an indepth
analysis of historic expenditures and
determined that there is room for reductions in
the Services and Supplies accounts. Therefore,
a net reduction of $55,893 is recommended in
the Services and Supplies accounts.
Additional reductions in this budget unit could
jeopardize the amount of State and Federal
funding that this budget unit would receive in
the future. The Department must spend all of
the funding that is received from these sources
in order to maintain this level of funding.
This budget is recommended at $3,268,171,
which is an increase of $25,502 (0.8%)
compared to FY 2013-14. The General
Fund provides approximately 55% of the
financing for the District Attorney’s Office
and is increased by $45,882 (1.7%)
compared to FY 2013-14.
It should be noted that these funding
calculations reflect the addition of Public
Safety Augmentation Funds (Proposition
172), which are transferred into the Public
Safety fund through the Public Safety
General budget unit (2-210). California
voters enacted Proposition 172 in 1993,
which established a permanent statewide
half-cent sales tax for support of local public
safety functions. Proposition 172 funding is
budgeted at $6,900,000 for FY 2014-15 and
the full amount received is transferred from
the Public Safety Augmentation Fund (0-
282) to the Public Safety Fund (0-015). In
FY 2014-15, the General Fund is budgeted
to contribute approximately $14.2 million in
funding to the Public Safety fund in excess
of the $6,900,000 Proposition 172 funding.
The District Attorney’s Office FY 2013-14
Adopted Budget included 28.5 positions,
reduced from 30.5 in FY 2012-13. The
District Attorney did not concur with this
position allocation. During budget hearings,
the Board of Supervisors adopted the
County Administrator’s recommended
position allocation, but requested that the
District Attorney work with the County
Administrator’s Office and return to the
Board of Supervisors in July to present a
mutually acceptable department
organization and position allocation for the
Office that would result in the same savings
as proposed in the Recommended Budget.
The agreed upon plan, adopted by the Board
of Supervisors on July 23, 2013, included
elimination of the Administrative Services
Officer position, elimination of the Criminal
Intelligence Technician position, addition of
an Accountant II position and unfunding one
Legal Secretary I position. Position
allocations for the Assistant Chief
Investigator position, one vacant Deputy
District Attorney position and one Senior
Criminal Investigator position were restored,
resulting in the current position allocation of
30.5 Full-Time Equivalent positions.
The District Attorney position is currently
vacant, though an election is scheduled for
shortly after the publication of the
Recommended Budget for FY 2014-15.
Funding of $103,200 has been removed
from the FY 2014-15 Recommended Budget
due to the District Attorney position vacancy
and possible staffing changes once a new District Attorney is elected. No permanent
staffing changes are recommended at this
time.
The District Attorney’s Office has requested,
and the Community Corrections Partnership
(CCP) has approved, continued funding for a
Deputy District Attorney position for pre-trial
services and revocation-related duties. This
position was first created and funded by the
CCP in FY 2013-14.
The recommended budget does not include
the continued use of Local Anti-Drug
Programs (0-264) funds and District
Attorney Asset Forfeiture Trust (0-293)
funds at this time. These special revenue
funds supplement the District Attorney’s
Office’s efforts to investigate and prosecute
crime. As of July 1, 2014, the fund balance
of Fund 0-264 is projected to be $14,000,
while the fund balance of 0-293 is projected
to be $44,000.
This budget is recommended at $42,572,
which is an increase of $364 (0.9%)
compared to FY 2013-14. The General Fund provides 100% of the financing for
this budget unit.
It should be noted that many of the
expenditures incurred by each year’s Grand
Jury are authorized in Government Code and
are not restricted by the County’s annual
budget. These expenditure items are based
on the needs of each year’s Grand Jury and
may vary from year to year. The County
ultimately has limited ability to affect or
predict expenditures.
This budget is recommended at $5,976,711,
which is a decrease of $385,420 (6.1%)
compared to FY 2013-14. The General Fund
provides approximately 42.9% of the funding
for this budget unit and is decreased by
$184,491 (6.7%) compared to FY 2013-14.
In addition to the reduction of one Supervising
Probation Officer, the Recommended Budget
includes defunding one vacant Deputy
Probation Officer position and eliminating one filled Accounting Technician II position. This
results in a General Fund reduction of
$163,616 and reduces the Department’s
permanent staffing by one position.
The defunding of two positions (one vacant
Supervising Probation Officer and one vacant
Deputy Probation Officer) coupled with the
elimination of the filled Accounting
Technician II position, is recommended in
order to reduce the overall General Fund
contribution to this program. The
recommended organizational structure, as
recommended by the Chief Probation Officer,
represents a reasonable span of control for all
supervisory positions within the Department.
Specifically, the supervisor-to-staff ratio for
the Supervising Probation Officer positions as
recommended is one supervisor per 7.4
officers (1:7.4). The probation industry
standard ranges between one supervisor for
every six officers (1:6) and one supervisor for
every eight officers (1:8).
The recommended elimination of the
Accounting Technician II position, which
results in a layoff, comes two years after the
Department reorganized its fiscal division.
The reorganization included adding a Deputy
Director of Probation – Administration and
Finance position, deleting the Administrative
Services Officer position, and adding an
Accountant II position.
Capital Assets are recommended at $40,000
for the purchase of a replacement Live Scan
machine. This is funded by the DNA
Identification Proposition 69 Fund (0-300) and
has no General Fund cost.
This budget unit receives $71,000 in
Realignment (1991) funds, which are
transferred from the Local Health and Welfare
Trust, Social Services Fund (0-248).
This budget is recommended at $1,000, which
is the same as FY 2013-14. This budget unit
does not receive financing from the General
Fund as it is funded by Realignment funds,
which are transferred from the Local Health
and Welfare Trust, Social Services Fund (0-
248).
This budget is recommended at $1,427,995,
which is a decrease of $12,305 (0.9%)
compared to FY 2013-14. The General
Fund provides 66.5% of the funding for this
budget unit and is reduced by $5,305 (0.4%)
for FY 2014-15. The decrease in the overall
Juvenile Hall budget is primarily due to the
10% reduction in Sutter County’s share of
costs for the operation of the Tri-County
Facility.
It should be noted that these funding
calculations reflect the addition of Public
Safety Augmentation Funds (Proposition
172), which are transferred into the Public Safety fund through the Public Safety
General budget unit (2-210). California
voters enacted Proposition 172 in 1993,
which established a permanent statewide
half-cent sales tax for support of local public
safety functions. Proposition 172 funding is
budgeted at $6,900,000 for FY 2014-15 and
the full amount received is transferred from
the Public Safety Augmentation Fund (0-
282) to the Public Safety Fund (0-015). In
FY 2014-15, the General Fund is budgeted
to contribute approximately $14.2 million in
funding to the Public Safety fund in excess
of the $6,900,000 Proposition 172 funding.
The impact of the new Tri-County JPA will
be monitored throughout FY 2014-15 as will
the project to construct the new Tri-County
Juvenile Rehabilitation Facility. The JPA
does not establish a cost sharing agreement
for the construction of the new facility.
Each county’s share for any costs over the
amount provided for in the grant from the
BSCC will be negotiated separately and
brought to the Board of Supervisors for
approval.
This budget is recommended at $682,612,
which is a decrease of $2,829 (0.4%)
compared to FY 2013-14. The General
Fund provides 92.7% of the financing for
this budget unit and is increased by $10,620
(1.7%). This increase in unreimbursed cost
is due to a projected decrease in Public
Safety Realignment revenue approved by
the Community Corrections Partnership
based upon caseload.
In comparing appointed felony and
misdemeanor cases for the first six months
of FY 2012-13 with the first six months of
FY 2013-14, there was a slight increase in
felony violation of probation cases, but
felony appointments have remained the
same. Misdemeanor cases have increased
approximately 7%. The Public Defender’s
Office now appears at custody arraignments
under the Probation Department’s pretrial
service program and bail reduction request.
Though the Superior Court is ordering in
some cases, as a condition of probation,
payment of a nominal fee for reimbursement
to the County of Sutter for the services of
the Public Defender’s Office, it is difficult to
predict how much revenue will be received
for FY 2014-15. The Sutter County Public
Defender’s Office has been able to collect
for services rendered to those who have
been involuntarily held at private psychiatric
centers. Based upon the first six months of
the FY 2013-14, it is anticipated the
Department should receive reimbursement
revenues totaling $4,000 for FY 2014-15.
This budget is recommended at $19,876,974,
which is a decrease of $432,670 (2.1%)
compared to FY 2013-14. All funding is
provided by the State through Public Safety
Realignment.
As previously stated, this fund is designed to
be a “pass-through” budget where funds will
immediately pass through to the appropriate
operating budget or special revenue fund as
budgeted. Funding budgeted to be used
completely each fiscal year will pass through
to an operating budget, while funds not used
completely in a single fiscal year will pass
through to a special revenue fund, such that
any unused funds will remain separate across
budget years. This prevents fund balances
from becoming co-mingled and will allow
each department responsible for these
realigned funds to accurately and more easily
track the expenditure and fund balance of
individual revenue streams.
This budget is recommended at $2,760,164,
which is a decrease of $15,746 (0.6%)
compared to FY 2013-14. The General
Fund provides approximately 53% of the
financing for the Sheriff’s Department and is
increased in the Communications budget by
$5,401 (0.2%) compared to FY 2013-14.
It should be noted that these funding
calculations reflect the addition of Public
Safety Augmentation Funds (Proposition
172), which are transferred into the Public
Safety fund through the Public Safety
General budget unit (2-210). California
voters enacted Proposition 172 in 1993,
which established a permanent statewide
half-cent sales tax for support of local public
safety functions. Proposition 172 funding is
budgeted at $6,900,000 for FY 2014-15 and
the full amount received is transferred from
the Public Safety Augmentation Fund (0-
282) to the Public Safety Fund (0-015). In
FY 2014-15, the General Fund is budgeted
to contribute approximately $14.2 million in
funding to the Public Safety fund in excess
of the $6,900,000 Proposition 172 funding.
The recommended budget includes the
continued use of Sheriff’s Assessment Fee
Funds (0-225) to fund a Sheriff’s Legal
Specialist position. These funds were first
used for this purpose in FY 2011-12. Fund
0-225 is projected to have close to a $0
balance as of July 1, 2014, with revenue of
$19,000 in FY 2014-15. Combined with the
recommended use of $50,925 of Sheriff’s
Civil Fees Funds (0-210), the General Fund
contribution for this position is $0 for FY
2014-15.
The total transfer in to the Communications
budget unit from Special Revenue Funds has
decreased by $17,516. This reduction is due
to a reduction in Federal Justice Assistance
Grant revenue, which varies each year.
For the fourth consecutive year, it is
recommended to leave three positions
vacant and unfunded in the Communications
budget. These positions are a Criminal
Records Technician, a Public Safety
Dispatcher and a Supervising Public Safety
Dispatcher. Defunding and leaving these
positions vacant negatively impacts the level
of service internally and to the public.
Further reductions are not recommended at
this time.
This budget is recommended at $587,896,
which is an increase of $27,086 (4.8%)
compared to FY 2013-14. The General Fund does not provide any financing for this budget
unit as it is 100% funded by the State.
Trial court security was a component of Public
Safety Realignment in FY 2011-12. Therefore,
funding is first deposited into the County Local
Revenue Fund 2011 (0-140) in the Trial Court
Security (2-105) budget unit before it is
transferred into this operating budget. The
County Local Revenue Fund 2011 is discussed
in greater detail in its own budget narrative.
This budget is recommended at $6,370,262,
which is a decrease of $12,452 (0.2%)
compared to FY 2013-14. The General
Fund provides approximately 53% of the
financing for the Sheriff’s Department and is
decreased in the Sheriff-Coroner budget by
$11,086 (0.2%) compared to FY 2013-14.
It should be noted that these funding
calculations reflect the addition of Public
Safety Augmentation Funds (Proposition
172), which are transferred into the Public
Safety fund through the Public Safety
General budget unit (2-210). California
voters enacted Proposition 172 in 1993,
which established a permanent statewide
half-cent sales tax for support of local public
safety functions. Proposition 172 funding is
budgeted at $6,900,000 for FY 2014-15 and
the full amount received is transferred from
the Public Safety Augmentation Fund (0-
282) to the Public Safety Fund (0-015). In
FY 2014-15, the General Fund is budgeted
to contribute approximately $14.2 million in
funding to the Public Safety fund in excess
of the $6,900,000 Proposition 172 funding.
For FY 2014-15, it is recommended that two
(2) currently vacant Deputy Sheriff positions
be left vacant and unfunded. Even with
these vacancies, the Sheriff’s number of
filled Deputy Sheriff positions will be the
same as the average number of filled
positions over the past several years. Since
FY 2008-09, the average number of filled
Deputy Sheriff positions in the Sheriff-
Coroner budget unit has been 29. The
current recommendation provides for 29
filled Deputy Sheriff positions in the
Sheriff-Coroner budget unit.
In FY 2013-14, it was recommended that
three (3) vacant Deputy Sheriff positions be
eliminated. During the FY 2013-14 budget
hearings, one Deputy Sheriff position was
restored, resulting in 29 funded Deputy
Sheriff positions in the Sheriff-Coroner
budget unit. In August 2013, increased
revenue projections allowed for the remaining
two vacant positions that had been eliminated
during budget hearings to be restored by the
Board of Supervisors, for a total of 31 funded
Deputy Sheriff positions in FY 2013-14, and
no decrease in staffing during that budget
year.
Capital Assets are recommended at $148,500
for the purchase of three (3) replacement
patrol vehicles. Five patrol vehicles were
replaced in FY 2013-14. For FY 2014-15, the
Sheriff is also requesting that two inmate
transport vans be replaced. The total cost for
the two replacement vans equals $94,000 and
is included separately in the County Jail
budget unit (2-301).
COPS funds are not currently budgeted in the
FY 2014-15 Recommended Budget. The
Sheriff has not yet determined how these
funds will be used. Once that determination
is made, the Sheriff will present his
recommendations to the Board of Supervisors
along with a budget amendment. COPS
funds may not be used to supplant current
County public safety funding and therefore do
not reduce the General Fund contribution to
the Public Safety Fund. It is anticipated the
Sheriff-Coroner will have approximately
$200,000 in COPS funding available for use
by the end of FY 2014-15.
This budget is recommended at $132,726,
which is an increase of $704 (0.5%) over FY
2013-14. This small increase is offset by
revenue from the other two participating
agencies and CalMMET revenue transferred
in from the County Local Revenue Fund
2011 (0-140) and results in no unreimbursed
cost for the General Fund. The County
Local Revenue Fund 2011 is discussed in
greater detail in its own budget narrative.
The NET 5 Secretary - Law position is
allocated in this budget unit. Sutter County
pays one third of the cost of the position’s
salary and benefits.
This budget is recommended at $354,581,
which is an increase of $69,773 (24.5%)
compared to FY 2013-14. The General Fund
provides approximately 53% of the financing
for the Sheriff’s Department and is increased
in the Sheriff – Boat Patrol budget by
$71,828 (141.8%). This shift in costs to the
Boat Patrol budget unit results in an
offsetting reduction in the Sheriff Coroner (2-
201) budget unit and is based solely upon the
salaries of assigned personnel.
It should be noted that these funding
calculations reflect the addition of Public
Safety Augmentation Funds (Proposition
172), which are transferred into the Public
Safety fund through the Public Safety
General budget unit (2-210). California
voters enacted Proposition 172 in 1993,
which established a permanent statewide
half-cent sales tax for support of local public
safety functions. Proposition 172 funding is
budgeted at $6,900,000 for FY 2014-15 and
the full amount received is transferred from
the Public Safety Augmentation Fund (0-282)
to the Public Safety Fund (0-015). In FY
2014-15, the General Fund is budgeted to
contribute approximately $14.2 million in
funding to the Public Safety fund in excess of
the $6,900,000 Proposition 172 funding.
It is estimated that approximately 60% of the
total expenditures for the Boat Patrol budget
unit will be reimbursed by the State
Department of Boating and Waterways in FY
2014-15. These reimbursements are derived
from boat registration fees. The County
contributes collected boat taxes and pays for
expenditures not subject to State
reimbursement. The Department of Boating
and Waterways’ allocation to Sutter County
is likely to remain at $214,800 as it has for
the past several years. Thus, any expenditure
increases beyond the allocation and collected
boat taxes become a County General Fund
cost.
No reductions are recommended for this
budget unit. However, the Sheriff staffs this
budget unit with personnel from the Sheriff-
Coroner budget unit (2-201), where there is a
FY 2014-15 budget recommendation to leave
two (2) vacant Deputy Sheriff positions
vacant and unfunded.
This budget is recommended at $1,237,718,
which is an increase of $34,146 (2.8%)
compared to FY 2013-14. The General Fund
provides approximately 53% of the financing
for the Sheriff’s Department and is increased
in the Sheriff – Live Oak budget by $4,935
(2.6%) compared to FY 2013-14.
The majority of costs for patrolling the area
in and around the City of Live Oak are
shared 80% by the City and 20% by the
County. However, the salary and benefits of
a Lieutenant position, all dog handlingrelated
items, and new patrol vehicles are
costs covered in full by the City. The
Sheriff provides some law-enforcement
services to the City of Live Oak at no charge
for which the City would have to pay if it
were to have its own police department, or if it had a typical contract for sheriff services.
Among these services are dispatch,
detectives (for major felonies), records,
narcotics, and special enforcement detail
(SWAT).
No reductions are recommended for this
budget unit. However, the Sheriff staffs this
budget unit with personnel from the Sheriff-
Coroner budget unit (2-201), where there is
a FY 2014-15 budget recommendation to
leave two (2) Deputy Sheriff positions
vacant and unfunded. Any reductions to the
Sheriff-Coroner budget unit may
correspondingly reduce Sheriff – Live Oak
staffing. Any changes to staffing levels
would necessitate an adjustment to the
contract between Sutter County and the City
of Live Oak.
This budget is recommended at $9,183,588,
which is an increase of $625,315 (7.3%)
compared to FY 2013-14. The General
Fund provides approximately 53% of the
financing for the Sheriff’s Department and is
increased in the Jail budget by $499,020
(6.6%) compared to FY 2013-14.
It should be noted that these funding
calculations reflect the addition of Public
Safety Augmentation Funds (Proposition
172), which are transferred into the Public
Safety fund through the Public Safety
General budget unit (2-210). California
voters enacted Proposition 172 in 1993,
which established a permanent statewide
half-cent sales tax for support of local public
safety functions. Proposition 172 funding is
budgeted at $6,900,000 for FY 2014-15 and
the full amount received is transferred from
the Public Safety Augmentation Fund (0-
282) to the Public Safety Fund (0-015). In
FY 2014-15, the General Fund is budgeted
to contribute approximately $14.2 million in
funding to the Public Safety fund in excess
of the $6,900,000 Proposition 172 funding.
One Correctional Officer position is
recommended to be transferred to the
Sheriff’s Inmate Welfare Fund (0-184)
budget unit. The recommended position
allocations of both the Jail and the Sheriff’s
Inmate Welfare Fund reflect this transfer.
This Correctional Officer position
coordinates the Work Release program for
the Jail, which is a direct, non-mandated
service for inmates. The Sheriff’s Inmate
Welfare Fund is discussed in greater detail
in its own budget narrative.
Overtime is recommended at $269,540.
Although requested to increase in FY 2014-
15, overtime is anticipated to decrease as
Correctional Officer positions are now fully
staffed. In the two prior fiscal years, several
positions were vacant during recruitment
efforts.
Capital Assets are recommended at $100,669
for the purchase of two (2) replacement
transport vans and one (1) replacement food
delivery cart.
The FY 2013-14 Jail budget stated, “The
effects of Public Safety Realignment are
likely to be more fully realized during FY
2013-14 with an anticipated further increase
in Jail population and related increases in
costs in staffing, inmate medical costs, and
other related expenses.” This statement has
proven to be accurate with Jail Medical
expenses budgeted to increase by $266,014
over the prior year. The majority of this
increase, $170,000, is for direct inmate
medical care. The Jail Medical budget (4-
134) is discussed in greater detail in its own
budget narrative.
The recommended budget for Household
Expense has increased by $44,400 due to
increased jail population and turnover. This
amount is based upon prior year actual
expenses and current year projected
expenses.
The Rents/Leases and Utilities accounts
reflect an overall decrease due to the
implementation of the Chevron Energy
Savings and Infrastructure Upgrade project,
approved by the Board of Supervisors in FY
2013-14. The County Jail will receive
several energy saving upgrades through this
project. The Jail’s share of the annual
financing payment for these improvements
is reflected in Rents/Leases account, and the anticipated savings is reflected in the
Utilities account.
Sutter County is in the process of expanding
the County Jail. The project will expand the
capacity of the Maximum Security facility
by 42 beds, and is feasible only due to a $9.7
million bond financing grant from the State.
The Jail Expansion Project (1-701) budget
unit was created to account for costs
incurred for the Main Jail Expansion project
and is discussed in its own narrative.
This budget is recommended at $336,978,
which is an increase of $40,978 (13.8%)
compared to FY 2013-14. This increase is
related to one Correctional Officer position
being transferred into the Sheriff’s Inmate
Welfare Fund. This Correctional Officer
position coordinates the Work Release
program for the Jail, which is a direct, nonmandated
service for inmates. This fund
generates approximately $290,000 in User
Pay revenues each year. Therefore, $40,978
of fund balance is being used to offset a
portion of the cost of this position, as
described below.
The General Fund does not provide any
financing for this budget unit. This fund is
financed by revenue generated from inmate
use of public telephones and inmate
purchases from the jail commissary.
This budget is recommended at $582,094,
which is an increase of $161,204 (38.3%)
compared to FY 2013-14. This increase is
due to the Probation Department increasing
its use of SLESF funds for FY 2014-15.
The General Fund does not provide any
financing for this budget unit.
The recommended budget includes
$166,743 in the Cancellation of Obligated
Fund Balance account for the Probation
Department.
Separately, a recommended increase of
$131,053 in the Increase in Obligated Fund
Balance account represents those funds
which the Sheriff-Coroner and County Jail
anticipate to receive during FY 2014-15.
The Sheriff has not yet determined a use for
these funds, and will present a plan and
budget amendment to the Board of
Supervisors for any future requested uses.
This budget is recommended at $951,000,
which is a decrease of $10,887 (1.1%)
compared to FY 2013-14. The General
Fund provides 20.1% of the financing for
this budget unit and is increased by $33,113
(20.9%) due to projected revenue for FY
2014-15.
The recommended budget is $512,520,
which is a decrease of $22,500 (4.2%)
compared to FY 2013-14. The General
Fund provides 81.3% of the funding for this
budget unit and is reduced by $20,100
(4.6%) for FY 2014-15.
