The Recommended Budget represents an overall decrease of $6,572 or 70% in revenues and
an increase of $39,761 or 2% in appropriations when compared to the FY 2013-14 Adopted
Budget. As a result, the Net County Cost has increased $46,333 or 3%.
The change in revenues is due to a decrease in charges for services ($6K) related to a
decrease in Board of Equalization hearings held for property reassessments.
The increase in appropriations is comprised of employee salaries, health insurance and
retirement costs ($98K). Decreases in other appropriations help to offset this increase and
include $12K in services in supplies, $13,500 in fixed assets and $32,769 in intrafund transfers
(related to the change in billing practice for County Information Technology cost applied
charges).
In FY 2013-14, the Board of Supervisors budget included appropriations of $95,000 for the
anticipated launch of the Home Care Aide Registry for Elder and/or Dependent Adult Caregivers
in support of the county’s elder protection efforts. The $95,000 had been appropriated in the
Clerk of the Board budget based on prior year savings in the District IV Supervisor’s budget. In
FY 2014-15 the funding for this effort has been included in the Health and Human Services
Agency recommended budget for the purposes of implementation.
Fixed asset appropriations of $9,500 are recommended for updating the video and camera
equipment in the Board of Supervisors Chambers. The current equipment is over 20 years old.

Chief Administrative Office Comments
Fund Type 10 – General Fund
The Recommended Budget represents an overall decrease of $148,951 or 9% in revenues and
an increase of $223,213 or 3% in appropriations when compared to the FY 2013-14 approved
budget. As a result, the Net County Cost is increased by $372,164 or 6%.

Budget & Operations
The Recommended Budget for this unit represents an overall increase of $72,629 in revenues
and $367,615 in appropriations when compared to the FY 2013-14 approved budget. As a
result, the Net County Cost is increased by $294,986. A large portion of the increased Net
County Cost is related to the full cost of the Assistant Chief Administrative Officer (ACAO). This
cost was largely offset in FY 2013-14 due to the ACAO serving as the Acting Director of
Community Development. General liability insurance also increased $103K as well as
increased salaries and benefits of $125K as a result of negotiated labor increases.
Central Fiscal/Administrative
The Recommended Budget for this unit represents an increase in revenues of $86,862 and a
decrease in appropriations of $6,282 resulting in a decrease to Net County Cost of $93,144
when compared to the FY 2013-14 approved budget. These changes are primarily related to
increased charges for services to other departments.

Procurement
The Recommended Budget for this unit represents a decrease of $9,682 in revenues and an
increase of $21,321 in appropriations when compared to the FY 2013-14 approved budget. As
a result, the Net County Cost is increased by $31,003. The increase in appropriations is
primarily related to increased salaries and benefits as a result of negotiated labor increases.
Facilities
The Recommended Budget for this unit represents a decrease in revenues of $298,760 and
$159,441 in appropriations when compared to the FY 2013-14 approved budget. This results in
an increase to Net County Cost of $139,319. The decreased revenue is offset with increased
intrafund abatements due to a change in methodology related to charges to departments for
building and maintenance services. The remaining increase in appropriations is related to
increased salaries and benefits as a result of negotiated labor increases.
Staffing Changes
The Department requested the deletion of the Office Assistant position along with a request to
move the position to Human Resources. The Department also requested the addition of an
Administrative Technician to help with the large facility workload related to implementation of the
Vanir assessment. The Administrative Technician position request has been placed on hold
and will be added to the “wish list” for possible funding in September.
Fund 13 – Accumulative Capital Outlay
Capital Facilities Workplan
The table below includes the Facilities Capital Workplan. This is a preliminary plan and the
Department will be returning to the Board for a more in depth discussion of the Facilities Capital
Improvement Plan.

The Recommended Budget represents an overall decrease of $9,920 or 2% in revenues and
$150,223 or 5% in appropriations when compared to the FY 2013-14 approved budget. As a
result, the Net County Cost has decreased $140,303 or 5%.
The decrease in revenues and appropriations is primarily related to a change in methodology for
mainframe cost applied charges. Salaries and benefits increased $153K related to
compensation and retirement costs. Intrafund transfers decreased $294K due to the deletion of
mainframe and network cost applied charges. The net of the increased salaries and benefits
and decreased intrafund transfers results in the overall decrease of $150K in appropriations.
The Chief Administrative Office is recommending several add/deletes to the Auditor’s personnel
allocation to true up the allocations with the actual filled positions. These changes do not
impact the Net County Cost as the salaries budgeted match the recommended add/deletes.

The Recommended Budget represents an overall increase of $83,272 or 5% in revenues and
an increase of $52,271 or 2% in appropriations when compared to the FY 2013-14 approved
budget. As a result, the Net County Cost has decreased $31,001 or 3%.
The increase in revenues is primarily related to Interfund revenue from the County ACO fund to
offset increased appropriations for a limited term Sr. Accountant position that will be assisting
with the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system implementation efforts ($65,000). This
position was approved by the ERP Executive Steering Committee. Other revenue increases
include an increase in anticipated Transient Occupancy Tax revenues ($21,862).
The department also requested the addition of a Sr. Accountant to assist with development and
implementation of an enhanced collection program for delinquent unsecured taxes. Although
the enhanced collection efforts may result in additional revenues to the County, the Chief
Administrative Office is not recommending this position at this time. In keeping with the
County’s Strategic Investment Plan, the Chief Administrative Office recommends the
department first work with Information Technologies to identify ways to enhance collection
efforts through improved use of technology, including potential solutions through the ERP,
before any additional staffing is considered.

The Recommended Budget represents an overall increase of $16,690 or 4% in revenues and
an increase of $118,438 or 3% in appropriations when compared to the FY 2013-14 approved
budget. As a result, the Net County Cost has increased $101,748 or 3%.
Revenues for the most part remain flat. The increase in appropriations is related to salaries and
benefits. The Assistant Assessor position has remained vacant and unfunded for three years.
The department is requesting to fund and fill this position in FY 2014-15 at a cost of
approximately $149,000. The Recommended Budget includes the deletion of 1.0 FTE
Assessment Technician and the addition of 1.0 FTE Appraiser to true up the department’s
personnel allocation for a previously authorized overfill at the Appraiser level.

The Recommended Budget represents an overall increase of $13,250 or 3% in revenues and
an increase of $249,870 or 9% in appropriations when compared to the FY 2013-14 Adopted
Budget. As a result, the Net County Cost has increased $236,620 or 10%.
The change in revenues is based on current approved billing rates and the projected need for
legal services from departments. The increase in appropriations is related to costs associated
with the anticipated retirement of the current County Counsel, previously approved salary
increases, and the re-budgeting of $40,000 for an update to County Counsel’s case
management system that was approved in FY 2013-14 but not yet implemented. Fixed assets
of $6,400 are for computer tablets to be used by attorneys that spend much of their work day in
court.

The Recommended Budget represents an overall increase of $4,400,354 or 11% in revenues
and an increase of $4,656,227 or 11.2% in appropriations when compared to the FY 2013-14
approved budget. The Net County Cost has increased $255,873 or 16%.
The Human Resources Division receives no revenues. Revenues for the Risk Management
internal service fund are increasing primarily due to a return to full-cost billing for Risk programs
following the recent “rate holiday” that was implemented to bring internal service fund balances
down to a targeted 70% confidence level. Funding for the Liability and Worker’s Compensation
programs is based on actuarial analysis and recommendations of Bickmore Risk Services and
Consulting.
Appropriation increases of $4,656,227 are associated primarily with the increase in the cost of
health benefits in Risk Management ($3.2M). Professional & specialized services for Risk
Management include legal services related to liability programs ($700,000) and third Party
Administrator agreements for liability, workers comp and health ($576,212).
Funding for the County’s contribution for retiree health insurance is on a “pay as you go” basis,
as in the previous two fiscal years. The Retiree Health Contribution Plan Document caps the
amount to be spent on this benefit at 1.2% of Total Payroll. The estimated calculated cap is
$1,816,000 which is based on actuarial data. This amount will be paid through cost-applied
charges to the departments.
On Tuesday, May 13, 2014, the Board approved the addition of $250,000 for departmental
facilitation and coaching contracts in order to improve the overall workplace culture within the
County. This funding will be added at Addenda. The department has sufficient appropriations
within services and supplies to begin work on these contracts.
Recommended Staffing Changes
The Recommended Budget includes two position changes to true up the personnel allocation
based on actual staff and the addition of 1.0 Office Assistant I/II to Human Resources/Risk
Management which is offset by the deletion of 1.0 Office Assistant I/II position in the Chief
Administrative Office. The department also requested the addition of 1.0 Principal Human
Resources Analyst; however, that request is currently under review and is not included in the
budget at this time. The Chief Administrative is working with the Human Resources Director
and the Human Resources Strategic Investment Team regarding the staffing needs for the
department and will return to the Board with recommendations at a later date.

The Recommended Budget represents an overall decrease of $2,026,651 or 96% in revenues
and an increase of $3,424,666 or 74% in appropriations when compared to the FY 2013-14
approved budget. Overall, Net County Cost is increasing by $5,451,317 or 215%.
In May 2014, the department advised the Board of recommended changes in cost applied
methodologies and billing practices. Historically, the Information Technologies has direct-billed
each department for mainframe, network and PC support services. These support charges will
no longer be direct-billed to departments or recorded in the Information Technologies budget.
Instead, the charges will be processed through the County’s A-87 Cost Plan which is developed
and administered by the Auditor-Controller’s Office.
The increased Net County Cost in the Information Technologies budget will be partially offset by
reduced expenditures in other General Fund departmental budgets as they will not be directbilled
for Mainframe, Network or PC support services.

Non-General Fund departments will pay for IT support costs through the County’s A-87 Cost
Allocation Plan which will result in additional revenue in Department 15 (General Fund Other
Operations). It should be noted a that there is a two-year lag in charges associated with the A-
87 Cost Plan so it will take two years for this change in billing practice to “catch up” in
Department 15.
The remaining sources of revenue in Information Technologies are for application programming
and web support. This revenue is a combination of Charges for Services (Class 13) and
Intrafund Abatements (Class 73, shown in the appropriations section).
Salaries and benefits for the Information Technologies Department are increasing $582,128
primarily as a result of approved compensation increases as well as a number of position
additions/deletions that better align the allocations with current and anticipated program and
service delivery needs:
The net change to allocations is an increase of 1.0 FTE, however this increase is offiset by the
deletion of 1.0 FTE IT Department Coordinator in the District Attorney’s office. This change will
allow IT to provide service to the District Attorney from a centralized support model.
In the area of staffing the Department continues to look for ways to meet current operational
needs for old mainframe based systems, while at the same time, trying to adjust for various skill
sets that will be required to meet new technology needs.
Services and supplies are decreasing overall by $32,719. There are decreases in a number of
areas as a result of completing mainframe equipment and telephone technology projects in FY
2013-14 and the transfer of videotaping of Board meetings to the Board Clerk’s budget. The
Recommended Budget includes increased funding for software license agreements, and
continued implementation of e-Fax and a new (replacement) voice mail system.
Fixed assets have been budgeted at $107,100 and consist primarily of network and server
components that are needed to replace end of life equipment and to improve network
management efficiency ($72,100); telephone trunk controllers to support management of the
countywide telephone system ($30,000); and a smart board appliance to support project
planning and implementation efforts ($5,000).

The Recommended Budget represents an overall increase of $539,240 or 57% in revenues and
an increase of $818,099 or 24% in appropriations when compared to the FY 2013-14 approved
budget. As a result, the Net County Cost is increased by $278,859 or 12%.
FY 2014-15 is the first full year that the Economic Development budget includes the Housing,
Community and Economic Development (HCED) budget. The increase in revenue is primarily
related to Federal revenues ($562K) related to the HCED program. The increase in
appropriations is primarily related to HCED ($711K), as well as a slight increase ($155K) related
to increased special projects funding in Economic Development due to an anticipated increase
in TOT funding for FY 2014-15.
The Recommended Budget for Economic Development has been calculated using 75% of
actual Transient Occupancy Tax (TOT) revenues for FY 2012-13; however, this amount will be
revised in the Addenda process to reflect 75% of the actual TOT revenues for FY 2013-14, once
that amount is known. Appropriations for Economic Development include funding for the
Business and Economic Development Manager, $927,560 for promotional contracts, and
$790,000 to be programmed at a later date based on input from the County’s Economic
Investment Team and the Community and Economic Development Advisory Committee and
direction from the Board of Supervisors.
The Recommended Budget for the Rubicon is decreasing primarily due to less grant funding in
FY 2014-15. There is no Net County Cost associated with the Rubicon budget. The Parks and
River budget remain flat with no significant changes from FY 2013-14.
Staffing for the Economic Development program is included in the Chief Administrative Office.
The Recommended Budget includes one add/delete with the deletion of one Administrative
Services Officer and addition of one Department Analyst I/II to true up an existing underfill.
The HCED budget is still being refined and will be finalized at Addenda. The Recommended
budget includes $182,876 is revenues and appropriations.

The Recommended Budget represents an overall decrease of $118,442 or 5% in revenues and
a decrease of $256,402 or 7% in appropriations when compared to the FY 2013-14 approved
budget. As a result, the Net County Cost has decreased by $137,960 or 13%.
The change in revenue and appropriations in the Registrar of Voters is related to the reduced
funding for the Ease Grant. El Dorado County acts as the administrator of the grant for 13 other
counties. The grant assists localities to explore technological improvements for military and
overseas voters. Last fiscal year, the office collected a one-time online fee from the participating
counties and in FY 2014-15 the County will only be collecting a smaller maintenance fee. The
reduction in revenues is offset with a corresponding reduction in appropriations. In addition, the
Recorder-Clerk’s division is slowing down the amount of microfiche documents it is digitalizing,
which will lower its professional and specialized services line-item by approximately $172,600
compared to the FY 2013-14 approved budget.
The budget does include one staffing change to true up an underfill with the addition of an
Elections Technician and the deletion of a Sr. Elections Technician.

The membership and focus areas of the Grand Jury changes from year to year. The FY 2014-
15 Recommended Budget is based on the FY 2013-14 request.

The Recommended Budget for the Court Maintenance of Effort represents an increase in
revenue of $18,000 or 1% and an increase in appropriations of $18,000 or 1% from the FY
2013-14 approved budget. As a result, there is no increase in Net County Cost.
The Court facilities budget with Department 20 continues to reflect the full year funding for the
County Facility Payment (CFP) as required by AB1491.
The appropriation for the conflict panel includes funding for ten attorneys, seven on the west
slope and three in Lake Tahoe. The budget also includes $10,000 to cover the cost of any
criminal grand jury expenses should a panel be called during the year.

The Recommended Budget represents an overall increase of $124,063 or 5% in revenues and
an increase of $239,775 or 3% in appropriations when compared to the FY 2013-14 approved
budget. As a result, the Net County Cost is increased by $115,712 or 2%.
The increase in revenue is primarily related to the Office of Traffic Safety grant, a slight increase
from Proposition 172 – Public Safety Sales Tax, and funding from the Indian Gaming grant.
The increase in appropriations is primarily related to increased salaries and benefits ($337K)
which includes $100K budgeted for overtime costs related to cold case investigations. Services
and supplies are increasing $92K primarily in general liability insurance ($32K), contract
services ($19K), and law enforcement equipment expense related to radios and rifle equipment
($20K).
The recommended budget includes the deletion of one (1.0) vacant Legal Secretary and a (0.6)
vacant Victim Witness Claims Specialist. The department is also requesting the transfer of one
(1.0) Information Technology Department Coordinator to Central IT. The department is

requesting to delete a vacant Fiscal Administrative Manager and add a Program Manager I.
This is a cost neutral add/delete. The Program Manager job description allows for more
flexibility with this position. Currently the department receives fiscal support for grant
administration and reporting, as well as budget monitoring from the Auditor-Controller’s office.
In order to fund these costs the Chief Administrative Office is recommending the deletion of a
vacant Legal Secretary noted above.

The Recommended Budget represents an overall decrease of $28,177 or 8% in revenues and
an increase of $473,620 or 15% in appropriations when compared to the FY 2013-14 approved
budget. As a result, the Net County Cost is increased by $501,797 or 18%.
Revenue has increased slightly for Prop 172, Public Safety Sales Tax ($8K) which is offset with
a decrease in charges for service ($36K) due to the discontinuation of the contract with Alpine
County for Public Defender services.
Appropriation increases are primarily related to salaries ($295K), retirement ($45K) and health
insurance ($36K). A large portion of this increase is related to the addition of a Sr. Investigator.
The department has been contracting out for these services and after much analysis has
determined that these services are better performed by staff. A portion of the increase in
salaries is offset with a decrease in professional services ($98K) in anticipation of this change.
Special projects also increased ($60K) due to a one-time expense related to move costs. The
department has occupied the current location for approximately 10 years, but has now outgrown
the space. The department is working with Facilities Management to identify new space.
The budget includes the true up of the following positions: addition of a Legal Secretary
(underfill) and deletion of a Sr. Legal Secretary.
The Public Defender has identified an investment area in personnel, specifically, Investigative
Staff. Since the initial appointment of the Public Defender in May 2013, she has identified the
most critical need for the office as being the need to increase the number of Investigative Staff.
When the FY 2013-14 budget was recommended, it was noted that the “Public Defender is in
the process of re-evaluating the amount of investigative services required and adjustments may
be made at Addenda.” The Department was still engaged in research regarding the
investigative needs of the Department, so no adjustments outside of extending the current
contracts for two full time Investigators was done. After a comprehensive research of
investigative requests spanning a five year period, the proposal is to add 1 FTE Sr. Investigator,
1 FTE Investigator, and 1 FTE Investigative Assistant. This would result in the creation of a
much needed Investigative Unit consisting of 4 FTE’s (the Department already has one
Investigator allocation).
This Investigative unit would be capable of handling a wide variety of tasks to support the
Deputy Public Defenders. Additional investigative staff would allow for activities such as
conducting preliminary searches and completing more interviews in person rather than the less
preferred and less effective method of over the phone interviews. Adding the investigative staff
would also give investigative support to the South Lake Tahoe office and eliminate the need to
continue to contract out investigative services for that office. The increases in salary and
benefits for the three new positions will be partially offset by decreases in the investigative
services budget. Time intensive tasks such as locating witnesses and serving subpoenas would
be delegated to the Investigative Assistant, and higher level work would be assigned to the
Investigators and Sr. Investigator. The Sr. Investigator would be responsible for reporting
directly to the Public Defender and would assign investigative requests to the Investigative Staff.
This lead position is crucial to the successful implementation and running of the unit. The result
of adding these full-time allocations will assure the community that effective legal representation
is achieved and that there is not a two-tier system of justice.

In order to maintain the Board direction of a status quo budget, the Chief Administrative Office is
recommending the addition of one Sr. Investigator (1) FTE in FY 2014-15 at an approximate
cost of $112K. The cost of the Sr. Investigator is offset with savings in professional services
related to moving from contracted services to staff performing the work. The addition of the two
remaining investigative staff will be added to the “department request list” and re-evaluated in
September.

The Recommended Budget represents an overall decrease of $675,115 or 5% in revenues and
an increase of $2,803,019 or 5% in appropriations when compared to the FY 2013-14 approved
budget. As a result, the Net County Cost is increased by $3,478,134 or 8%.
The largest source of revenue for the Sheriff’s Office continues to be Proposition 172 - Public
Safety Sales Tax revenue. The CAO’s office closely monitors this revenue stream and if any
adjustments are necessary, they will be made in the addenda process.
The reductions in revenue are related to Homeland Security Grant funds, Asset Forfeiture funds
and Fingerprint ID funds. Appropriations have been reduced to offset the reductions in
revenues. Currently the Homeland Security Grant funding is unknown and will be added once
the grant is awarded. Fingerprint ID funds can’t be added until the Cal-ID RAN Board meets
and approves a budget. The Sheriff has not identified a need for Asset Forfeiture funds at this
point. If a need is identified later, a budget transfer will be initiated.
Overall salaries and benefits are increasing by $3,113,979. The majority of this increase ($2M)
is in worker’s compensation costs. Permanent salaries have increased $523K and retirement
$486K. Services and supplies are increasing $510K overall related to increased general liability
costs. Fixed assets is decreasing $514K when compared to the FY 2013-14 budget primarily
due to the one-time purchase of the Bear Cat armored vehicle in FY 2013-14. Intrafund
transfers are decreasing $210K due to changes in the cost applied methodology related to
information technology charges.

The Sheriff is requesting the following changes in staffing:
 Delete 1.0 Radio Maintenance Technician
 Delete 1.0 Sheriff’s Fiscal Technician and add 1.0 Administrative Technician to work in
the Sheriff’s Fiscal division to improve day to day operations relative to budget and
contract analysis along with implementation of the ERP.
Fund Type 11 – Jail Commissary
The Jail Commissary budget is projected at a total of $1,352,205. This budget is completely
offset by revenue from the Inmate Welfare Trust account. There is no Net County Cost
associated with this program

The Recommended Budget represents an overall decrease of $92,608 or 2% in revenues and
an increase of $418,749 or 3% in appropriations when compared to the FY 2013-14 approved
budget. As a result, the Net County Cost is increased by $511,357 or 5%.
The reduction in revenue is primarily related to a decrease in SB678 funding, AB109 funding
and SLESF-JJCPA funding totaling $144K. These reductions are partially offset with an
increase in the statewide allocation of ranch/camp funding as well as a slight increase in Prop
172 funds.
The increase in appropriations is primarily related to a $808K increase in salaries and benefits.
The majority of this increase is related to worker’s compensation costs ($357K), retirement
($183K) and permanent salaries ($141K). The majority of employees within the probation
department belong to a bargaining unit still under negotiations with the Board. Therefore, no
salary increases have been included for these employees. Salaries and benefits may need to
be adjusted in September if an agreement has been reached.
Appropriation increases in salaries and benefits has been offset with reduced services and
supplies ($111K). The majority of these decreases are related to a reduction in special
department expense related to reduced JJCPA services and a reduction in utilities as these
costs have been shifted to the facilities budget to be included with all other county owned
building utility costs. Other charges decreased $121K due to an anticipated decrease in
contracted ranch/camp commitments. Intrafund transfers decreased $205K due to the change
in methodology related to Information Technology cost applied charges.
The department included a request to add three (3) new positions in the FY 2014-15 budget.
The Chief Administrative Office is not recommending these additions at this time. The positions
will be added to the “wish list” for additional discussion in September.

The Recommended Budget represents an overall decrease of $9,975 or 12% in revenues and
an increase of $64,646 or 4% in appropriations when compared to the FY 2013-14 approved
budget. As a result, the Net County Cost is increased by $74,621 or 5% compared to the FY
2013-14 approved budget.
The decrease in revenue is primarily related to charges for Geographic Information System
(GIS) service fees and map check fees billed to Transportation for work related to various
projects. The Surveyor’s FY 2013-14 budget included $13,200 for this work; however, no work
was required of the Surveyor during that time. Interfund revenues for FY 2014-15 have been
reduced accordingly. The Surveyor has reviewed other sources of revenue in the charges for
services category (fees for addressing, map checks, and certificates of compliance) and has
included an increase of $3,517 based on current trends and information coming from the
development community.
Overall appropriations are increasing by $64,646. Salaries and benefits are increasing by
$53,548. For FY 2014-15, the budget includes $10,000 for extra help to address seasonal map
checking work and to assist GIS staff with data entry work associated General Plan
Implementation efforts ($10,000 reduction from the FY 2013-14 approved budget). Services
and supplies are increasing by $40,692 primarily related to General Liability Insurance
premiums. Intrafund transfer appropriations are decreasing by $24,417 primarily due to the
removal of various cost applied charges such as Mainframe Support ($15,429).
The Surveyor has requested one fixed asset, a laptop computer end of life replacement, totaling
$1,761 (decrease of $5,677 from FY 2013-14).

The Recommended Budget represents an increase $45,113 or 6% in revenues and an increase
of $25,819 or 2% in appropriations when compared to the FY 2013-14 approved budget. As a
result, the Net County Cost decreased by $19,294 or 4%.
The change in revenue reflects an increase in Noxious Weed grant funding through the Sierra
Nevada Conservancy ($61,673) offset with a decrease in State unclaimed gas tax (UGT)
funding ($16,133). The estimated UGT funding amount for FY 2014-15 is $273,421 and is
based on the actual amount received in FY 2013-14.
Overall appropriations remain relatively flat at $1,342,690, an increase of $25,819 over
FY 2013-14. Temporary employees for the Noxious Weed Program has been increased due to
the increase of funding for this program as noted above.
The Recommended Budget includes an increase ($8,873) in funding for a Memorandum of
Understanding with the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) for the provision of
wildlife damage management services ($43,004). Services include both urban/residential
animal damage issues as well as protection of agricultural lands (livestock and crops).

Within the General Fund programs in the Transportation Division, the Recommended Budget
represents a decrease of $155,664 or 11.2% in revenues and a decrease of $254,600 or 11.8%
in appropriations when compared to the FY 2013-14 approved budget. As a result, the Net
County Cost is decreasing by $98,938 or 12.9%. The decrease in revenues and appropriations
is primarily related to costs for the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES)
program being moved from the County Engineer to the Long Range Planning Division.
County Engineer
The Recommended Budget for the County Engineer includes a decrease in appropriations of
$335,962 and a decrease in revenues of $167,362 resulting in a decrease in Net County Cost of
$168,600. Net County Cost for this program is $579,537. This decrease is related to moving

the NPDES program to the Long Range Planning (LRP) Division and additional billable work
related to subdivision activity.
Cemetery Operations
The Recommended Budget for Cemetery operations includes an increase in appropriations of
$81,362 and an increase in revenue of $11,700 resulting in a Net County Cost increase of
$69,662. This increase is due to shifting 0.8 FTE of an Administrative Technician to this unit
from the CDA Administration and Finance unit to better suit operational needs.
Special Revenue Fund – Fund Type 11
The Recommended Budget represents a decrease of $9,613,193 or 11.3% in revenue and
appropriations when compared to the FY 2013-14 approved budget. The budget includes a
General Fund contribution of $500,000 for the road maintenance program (a decrease of $1.8
million from the FY 2013-14 approved budget).
The Special Revenue Fund budget is comprised of Road Fund Operations, Road Capital
Improvement Program, Road District Taxes, Erosion Control, Placerville Union Cemetery, and
Special Aviation. The chart below details the total revenues, appropriations and use of fund
balance included in the Recommended Budget for FY 2014-15.

Road Fund Operations includes the Maintenance Division, Transportation Planning and Land
Development, and Engineering functions. The Recommended Budget includes a decrease in
revenues of $802,811 and a decrease in appropriations of $1,200,338 when compared to the
current year budget. These changes result in the net use of fund balance being reduced by
$397,527. This decrease is attributable to a reduction in temporary employees and services and
supplies tied to the one-time increase in General Fund contributions in FY 2013-14 that will not
be rebudgeted in FY 2014-15. The use of Fund Balance is a one-time revenue source and the
division will need to identify new revenues or sustainable savings to fund operations in the long
term. Long-term financial health of the Road Fund appears to be a concern in the near future
unless significant changes are made within the Division.

A General Fund contribution to the road fund of $500,000 is included in the Recommended
Budget which represents a decrease of $1.8 million from FY 2013-14. This reduced amount
brings the total contribution back to FY 2012-13 levels.
Within the General Fund, Public Utility Franchise Fees are utilized to fund half of the NPDES
program as well as Road Maintenance activities. It is important to note that the Public Utility
Franchise Fees are a discretionary source of revenue and can be spent on any County function.
The table below summarizes the recommended use of these funds in FY 2014-15.

The recommended budget includes an increase in Capital Assets of $0.77M. Large items on the
Capital Asset purchase list include an Air Regenerative Sweeper (carryover from FY 13-14
budget), Road Paint Striper Truck (purchase in FY 2014-15 versus lease in current year),
Crafco Crack-Filler Machine (carryover from FY 2013-14 budget), two (2) Dumptrucks (replacing
22 year old vehicles), and several other vehicles and pieces of equipment as listed on the Fixed
Asset list.
Road Fund Capital Improvement Program (CIP)
The Recommended Budget for the Road Fund Capital Improvement Program (CIP) represents
a decrease of $9,138,036 in revenues and appropriations when compared to the FY 2013-14
approved budget. This budget fluctuates depending on the Board approved CIP. Funding and
appropriations are consistent with the Proposed 2014 CIP and is based on a per project basis.
Major projects scheduled for construction during FY 2014-15 include:
 Missouri Flat I/C Phase 1C
 Ice House Road Surface Rehab
 Cold Springs Road Realignment
 Salmon Falls Road at Glenesk Lane – Realignment
 Green Valley Road at Weber Creek – Bridge Replacement
 Consumes Mine Road at North Fork Consumes River – Bridge Maintenance
 Happy Valley Cutoff Road at Camp Creek – Bridge Maintenance
 Mosquito Road at South Fork American River – Bridge Maintenance
 Green Valley Road Bikeway (Loch Way to signal at Pleasant Grove Middle school)
 Wash Rack Project
Erosion Control Program
The Tahoe Environmental Improvement Program (EIP) is included in the division’s
Proposed 2014 CIP program and the budget is being submitted consistent with that document.

The Tahoe program is funded through available grant funds primarily USFS, CMAQ, CTC, and
TRPA mitigation funds. There is no cost to the General Fund for this program.
Projects scheduled for construction include:
 Golden Bear Erosion Control Project
 Lake Tahoe Boulevard Enhancement Project
 Sawmill 2B Bike Path and Erosion Control Project
 Forest View Water Quality Project
 County Service Area (CSA) #5 – Upper Area Erosion Control Project
Special Districts – Fund Type 12
Special Districts provides for the activities of County Service Areas 2, 3, 5, and 9, Zones of
Benefit, and the Georgetown Cemetery Zone. Areas and zones are established to provide road
and drainage maintenance, lighting, cemetery services and other localized services to a specific
area. Special Districts is primarily funded by taxes and special assessments to benefiting
parcels.
The Recommended Budget represents a decrease of $1,454,417 or 29.5% in revenue and
appropriations when compared to the FY 2013-14 approved budget. This decrease is primarily
due to decreased fixed asset appropriations ($1.06 M) related to removal of capital leases and
one-time purchases in FY 2013-14 as well as the decrease in revenues from the use of fund
balance and appropriations offsetting appropriations to fund balance designations that occurred
in FY 2013-14.
Airports /South Lake Tahoe Transit – Fund Type 31
The Airports are included in what is referred to as an Enterprise Fund. In governmental
accounting an Enterprise Fund is defined as a fund that provides goods or services to the public
for a fee that makes the entity self-supporting.
Both the Placerville and Georgetown Airports continue to require General Fund contributions to
sustain operations. Staff continues to explore alternatives to reaching sustainable operations
including a possible fee increase (fees were increased four years ago but the rates are still
lower than similar facilities in the area), alternative staffing patterns, and capital improvements
to provide additional hangers (see below).
The Recommended Budget represents an increase of $209,185 or 12.4% in revenues and
appropriations when compared to the FY 2013-14 approved budget. This change is primarily
related to an increase in professional services contracts related to Airport capital improvements.
The Recommended Budget includes a General Fund Contribution of $268,092 to the Airport
programs for the following:
 $174,300 for construction of a waterline which will accommodate additional hangers to
the Placerville Airport for increased economic development.
 $93,792 to fund the ongoing operations of the airports. An amount representative of the
property taxes generated by the airports is included as part of this request; Placerville
Airport - $30,631 and Georgetown Airport - $6,175. The remaining $56,986 is to sustain
the current operations of the Georgetown Airport.
There is no budget for South Lake Tahoe Transit for FY 2014-15. As such, there is a decrease
in appropriations of $40,946 for this unit.
Fleet – Fund Type 32
Fleet Services manages the planning, acquisition, and replacement of County vehicles, as well
as the sale or disposal of surplus vehicles and manages the fleet pool. Additionally, this unit
provides auto maintenance and repair services for County vehicles. Fleet Services receives
funding primarily from charges to County departments to recover costs of maintaining,
operating, and replacement of the fleet.
The Recommended Budget represents a decrease of $163,421 or 8.7% in revenues and
appropriations when compared to the FY 2013-14 approved budget. This budget includes an
appropriation for the purchase of 45 replacement vehicles, of which 25 are for the Sheriff’s
Department, for a total cost of $1,360,500. These vehicles are anticipated to exceed the
replacement target mileage by December 2014.
Staffing Changes
The Department is requesting several staffing changes. The Chief Administrative Office will be
working with the Department over the next few weeks to move forward with a recommendation
related to these changes by the budget workshop presentation.

The Recommended Budget for FY 2014-15 for the Development Services Division reflects the
reorganization of programs under the Community Development Agency structure and includes
the centralization of all administrative and finance staff, and the consolidation and expansion of
the Agency’s Long Range Planning unit. The budgets for these programs are included in the
Development Services Division budget.

The Recommended Budget for Development Services represents an overall increase of
$1,115,837 or 13.2% in revenues and an increase of $1,267,943 or 10.2% in appropriations
when compared to the FY 2013-14 approved budget. As a result, the Net County Cost has
increased $152,106 or 3.8%. Overall increases are due to the inclusion of revenues and
appropriations for the Community Development Agency’s Administration and Finance Division
and Long Range Planning unit.
Changes to revenues are primarily in license, permit and franchise fees which increased
$1,280,624 or 53.9% from the FY 2013-14 budget. These increases are related to an increase
in construction permit fees related to a continued rise in development permits ($858,336) along
with an increase in Public Utility Franchise Fees ($422,288) related to the NPDES program
shifting to the Long Range Planning unit. Charges for services are increasing ($403,058)
primarily due to plan checking, tentative map fees and grading plan applications, and increased
charges to the Missouri Flat Master Circulation and Funding Plan (MC&FP) for work updating
the program.
Expenditures are also increasing ($1,267,943), primarily in salaries and benefits ($620,930) and
professional services for contracts associated with Long Range Planning activities ($1,247,586).
Of the increased contract costs, a large portion of the costs are pass through charges related to
developer funded reimbursement agreements ($1,020,427). There is a like increase in revenue
associated with these agreements.
The Recommended Budget includes fixed assets totaling $97,625, an increase of $73,969, for
the purchase of seven laptops as the planning commission transitions to using Legistar and
going paperless, one laptop for the Tahoe equipment shop for equipment repair diagnostic
purposes and one laptop for construction inspection related activities, five tablets to help
expedite field inspection logging and tracking activities, three scanners that will be compatible
with all computers for South Lake Tahoe operations, replacement of a broken
microfiche/microfilm reader, the Agency’s portion of the data switch upgrade for Building “C”,
teleconferencing equipment to help reduce travel requirements and expand interviewing
opportunities, a hard installed projector in the Planning Commission chambers, and sixteen
laptop computers to replace outdated computers due for replacement.
Staffing Changes
The Department is requesting several staffing changes. The Chief Administrative Office will be
working with the Department over the next few weeks to move forward with a recommendation
related to these changes by the budget workshop presentation.

Materials—CUPA. The Recommended Budget represents an overall decrease of $270,515 or
12.3% in revenues and appropriations when compared to the FY 2013-14 approved budget.
The Net County Cost remains at zero.
The General Fund programs within Environmental Management are funded in part with solid
waste franchise fees. These fees are estimated at $985,000 for FY 2014-15. These fees are
discretionary and can be utilized to fund any County costs. The FY 2014-15 budget includes
$275,000 of these fees in Department 15 to fund countywide programs with the remaining
$710,000 funding Environmental Management programs (including $76,618 towards the CSA
#10 Solid Waste program, Fund Type 12).

The FY 2014-15 Recommended Budget for these programs includes a total revenue and
appropriation decrease of $270K. These decreases are related a reduction in Solid Waste
Franchise Fees offset with reductions in services and supplies and intrafund transfers.
CSA #10 & CSA #3 – Fund Type 12
The non-general fund programs within Environmental Management include South Lake Tahoe
Vector Control/Snow Removal (CSA #3), Household Hazardous Waste/Incident Response
(CSA #10), Solid Waste, and Liquid Waste.
There is no Net County Cost associated with these programs. Revenues and appropriations
have decreased $2.1 million. This decrease is primarily associated with a reduced use of fund
balance and the corresponding appropriation for designated fund balance not anticipated to be
used. This was a one-time event to accommodate a change in budgeting practice regarding
fund balance.

The Department is requesting several staffing changes. The Chief Administrative Office will be
working with the Department over the next few weeks to move forward with a recommendation
related to these changes by the budget workshop presentation.

The Health and Human Services Agency Administration Division was created in July 2013 to
provide efficiencies in administrative and fiscal support to all the various programs across the
agency. The division passes these fiscal and administrative costs to programs within the agency
based on direct program salaries. All Administrative Division costs are funded from State,
Federal, realignment, donations/fees, and General Fund.
The total Recommended Budget for the Administration Division is $4,973,461. There is a net
county cost surplus for FY 2014-15 due to an issue during the first year of charging agency
programs. During the first year, the Health and Human Services Agency Administration created
its cost model on budgeted position salaries instead of direct salaries expensed. Due to vacant
positions in the programs, there were fewer charges than the budgeted model. Largely due to
this reason, the division needed a one-time cash advance from the General Fund of
approximately $995,000 in FY 2013-14. These funds will be paid back to the General Fund with
the net county cost surplus during FY 2014-15. This issue should not occur again, at the same
level, because the new Agency will have actual trend information on position vacancies, which
will help to accurately project its budget.
Staffing Changes
The Division requested the addition of a Program Coordinator to lead the effort to develop a
robust volunteer and internship program for the Agency. Several HHSA programs utilize
volunteers and interns to assist with client service delivery. These volunteers and interns are a
valuable asset to the Agency. The Agency Strategic Plan has an objective to develop a more
formal and comprehensive process to recruit and retain community volunteers and interns. The
Program Coordinator position request has been placed on hold and will be added to the Agency
department request list for possible funding in September.

The total Recommended Budget for the Public Health Division of the Health and Human
Services Agency is $41,529,651 with a Net County Cost of $1,249,130 for Animal Services and
a General Fund contribution $4,007,221 for other programs (see detail in the Programs
Summary section above). The General Fund contribution is approximately $503,332 higher
when compared to the FY 2013-14 adopted budget. The increase is primarily related to an
increase to the medical contract for inmate health care.
Animal Services – General Fund
The Recommended Budget for Animal Services represents an increase of $112,956 or 9% in
revenues and an increase of $129,600 or 5% in appropriations when compared to the FY 2013-
14 approved budget. As a result, the Net County Cost increased by $16,644 or 1%.
The increase in revenues is primarily due to the cities’ contribution for the shared expenditures
of the Animal Services program. The other revenues for the program are budgeted at similar
amounts to last fiscal year.
Appropriations increased primarily due to increased personnel costs (salaries, health insurance,
retirement, etc.) with smaller increases to services and supplies (e.g. utilities costs) and fixed
assets (e.g. replacement of laptops).

The Animal Services program will be opening a new shelter in Diamond Springs during FY
2014-15 consisting of a 16,000 square foot building on 4.7 acres. The shelter will have an onsite
spay and neuter clinic, an exam room, improved housing area for animals, isolated holding
areas for better disease control, and a separate entry for adoption and stray animals. This
budget includes operating support for the new shelter (e.g. operating increases for utilities, etc.).
Recommended Staffing Changes
The Agency requested the addition of an Animal Services Officer to help minimize workload
impacts. The Animal Services Officer position request has been placed on hold and will be
added to the Agency “department request list” for possible funding in September.
Public Health Fund Type 11
The Recommended Budget for Public Health programs has decreased by $7,488,519 or 28%.
This decrease is primarily due to the reorganization of the Alcohol and Drug programs from the
Public Health Division to the Mental Health Division in the FY 2014-15 budget and the AB 85
legislation that was passed during FY 2013-14 that affected the Agency realignment revenue.
The budget includes a $4,007,221 General Fund contribution for various programs (see details
in the Program Summaries section above).
Grant for Medi-Cal Outreach and Enrollment (AB 82)
Public Health was awarded the Medi-Cal Outreach and Enrollment (AB 82) grant, in the amount
of $100,000. The purpose of the grant is to encourage access to health care services through
Medi-Cal enrollment by providing in-person enrollment assistance for persons that are newly
Medi-Cal eligible through the Affordable Care Act. The Division has decided to contract the
grant to a community partner to allow for greater outreach efforts to the community.
National Public Health Department Accreditation
In the new fiscal year, the Public Health Division intends to start a 5-year process of obtaining
the National Public Health Department Accreditation. The accreditation process will help the
division identify strengths and opportunities for improvement, enhance validity, and
accountability of public health programs and services. The accreditation process will allow the
Public Health Division enhanced funding opportunities, which could allow for expansion of
services to underserved populations. The accreditation process will be funded by the MAA
Special revenue fund balance.
Fixed Assets
Public Health Fund Type 11 has requested a number of fixed asset items for Public Health
programs totaling $300,800. The items are detailed in the Uses of Funds section above and are
funded primarily by realignment funds.

The total Recommended Budget for the Mental Health programs is $31,613,982, an increase of
$3,174,626 or 11% when compared to the FY 2013-14 adopted budget. There is a General
Fund contribution of $16,510 for County match requirements. The increase in the budget is
primarily due to the addition of the Alcohol and Drug Programs to the Mental Health Division
from the Public Health Division.
Traditional Mental Health Programs
The Recommended Budget for Traditional Mental Health Programs is $10,416,164 and
represents an overall decrease of $1,032,682 or 9% when compared to the FY 2013-14
adopted budget. The Traditional Mental Health programs are primarily funded by federal
revenues, realignment/state revenues, and charges for services to other counties and private
payers. The decrease in the budget is due to less fund balance available to the Traditional
Mental Health Programs. This change in fund balance was anticipated by the Agency, and
expenses were lowered in programs accordingly.
Traditional Mental Health funding continues to present a challenge to the Health and Human
Services Agency (HHSA) since the majority of traditional funds are spent on out of county
placements and placements in the Psychiatric Health Facility (PHF). HHSA is assessing how
services are provided in the PHF, including assessing the feasibility of contracting with a private
provider for PHF services to determine if a contractor is able to provide a safer environment for
both clients and staff while reducing costs.
In addition, the Mental Health Services Act Program is attempting to implement a residential
treatment facility in El Dorado County. The facility should help to reduce the number of
expensive out of county placements and assist clients in their transition from the PHF, which will
help to keep clients in the community allowing for access to a broad range of services.
Implementation of a residential treatment facility could help lower expenses in the Traditional
Mental Health programs in the future.
The State Katie A. v. Bonita Settlement Agreement
The State Katie A. v. Bonita settlement has a dual effect on the Agency. First there is increased
Child Protective Services (CPS) caseworker mental health screenings required for children who
are either in foster care or at imminent risk of being placed into foster care. Secondly, the
settlement requires the Mental Health Division to assess children referred by CPS to ensure
services are available to foster care clients who meet a special mental health medical necessity.
The Mental Health Division is working closely with CPS to ensure clients are assessed timely
and appropriate treatment plans are available. Additionally, Mental Health
Departments/Divisions, as well as Child Welfare Departments/Divisions statewide are working
with the State to obtain adequate funding to administer the settlement.
Mental Health Services Act (MHSA) Program

The Recommended Budget for MHSA Programs is $16,899,960 and represents an overall
decrease of $90,550 or .5% when compared to the FY 2013-14 adopted budget. MHSA
programs are funded primarily by MHSA funds, but also include federal revenues for MHSA
clients who are eligible under Medi-Cal programs.
The MHSA programs are reviewed on an annual basis to determine which programs are
successful (many of the programs are in the early stages of implementation) in meeting program
outcomes. The Mental Health Division has been reassessing MHSA services and reviewing
outcomes to ensure sufficient appropriations are available for future years to continue with the
current staffing levels and contract expenditures.
MHSA Plan
The MHSA plan is approved annually by the Board of Supervisors. The FY 2013-14 MHSA plan
included increases in services to the Transitional Aged Youth (TAY) population as well as to the
elderly. The budget includes appropriations for the continued implementation of the FY 2013-14
plan. The FY 2014-15 budget also includes the expansion of transitional housing in El Dorado
County, allowing clients stable home environments while providing skills to transition from highcare
placements back into the community.
Recommended Staffing Changes:
Mental Health is requesting position changes that better align personnel allocations with the
current funding, administrative and programmatic requirements of the department. Position
changes are detailed on the Personnel Allocation table. The positions are funded with Federal,
State, and Realignment funding. The change in positions, other than the transfer of Alcohol and
Drug Programs’ positions, are primarily within the MHSA Program as it continues to implement
yearly plans approved by the Board of Supervisors.
Alcohol and Drug Programs
The Recommended Budget for Alcohol and Drug Programs is $4,297,858 and represents an
overall increase of $125,576 or 3% when compared to the FY 2013-14 adopted budget. Alcohol
and Drug Programs are funded primarily by realignment funds and federal revenues.
Alcohol and Drug Program Move
The Alcohol and Drug Programs have moved from the Public Health Division to the Mental
Health Division. The programs are currently co-located with the Mental Health Division on the
West Slope and will be moving with the Mental Health Division to its new location in South Lake
Tahoe at the beginning of the fiscal year. This transition will allow the programs to work together
to ensure comprehensive client care and utilization of services through the behavioral health
recovery model. The use of fund balance has been budgeted to allow for potential expanded
services based on changes in service delivery.

The Recommended Budget represents an overall increase of $4,522,086 or 10% in revenues
and an increase of $4,659,879 or 10% in appropriations when compared to the FY 2013-14
approved budget. As a result, the Net County Cost is increased by $137,793 or 9%.
Increased revenues are primarily due to Federal revenue and realignment funding for
CalWORKs, Foster Care and adoption assistance and Family Support. The increase in funding
is offset by appropriations for the same programs.

The Recommended Budget represents an overall increase of $183,920 or 2% in revenues and
appropriations when compared to the FY 2013-14 approved budget. There is no Net County
cost in Community Services.
The General Fund Contribution request has an overall increase of approximately $233,600 from
the level of General Fund support included in the FY 2013-14 adopted budget. The is primarily
to cover one-time operating increases (e.g. two programs are implementing new case
management software systems) and the possibility of not receiving reimbursed for
administrative work from the Workforce Investment Act grantor, as well as increased costs
related to the Senior Day Care program.
IHSS & Public Housing Authority – BOS Governed Special Districts Fund Type 12
The Recommended Budget represents an overall decrease of $125,863 or 3% in revenues and
appropriations when compared to the FY 2013-14 approved budget. There is no Net County
cost in Fund Type 12. The decreased revenues are primarily related to decreases in state
funding and have been offset with decreased appropriations.
Affordable Care Act
The Health and Human Services Agency is responsible for administering many of the provisions
included in the Affordable Care Act of 2010 that seek to expand coverage, emphasize
prevention, and to improve the quality of health care and client outcomes. State and Federal
funding allocations in the Human Services Division programs are increasing in FY 2014-15 to
accommodate increased client caseloads and additional requirements imposed by the
implementation of the Affordable Care Act.
The CalWORKs Family Stabilization Program
The CalWORKs Family Stabilization Program was implemented effective January 1, 2014 to
provide intensive case management and services to clients to ensure a basic level of stability
within a family prior to, or concurrent with, participation in Welfare-to-Work activities with the
goal of increasing client success.
Commercially Sexually Exploited Children
The County is experiencing an increase in sex-trafficking victims in our region. Due to the
limited vender options in California to safely house the victims of sex-trafficking, the Health and
Human Services Agency looks for out-of-state facilities that can help minors who have been
exploited. The use of the out-of-state facilities increases appropriations necessary for travel,
case management, and foster child placements.
Workforce Investment Act Grantor
The Workforce Investment Act program is requesting an increase in General Fund contribution
of approximately $89,966. The increase is due to a review of the Health and Human Services
Agency indirect cost rate methodology to determine if the allocated amount will be allowed by
the State and included in the grant funding. If the indirect cost rate methodology is approved,
then an increased General Fund contribution will not be needed.
Home Care Aide Registry for Elder and/or Dependent Adult Caregivers
In FY 2013-14, the Board of Supervisors budget included appropriations of $95,000 for the
anticipated launch of the Home Care Aide Registry for Elder and/or Dependent Adult Caregivers
in support of the County’s elder protection efforts. The $95,000 had been appropriated in the
Clerk of the Board budget based on prior year savings from the District IV Supervisor’s
budget. In FY 2014-15, the funding for this effort has been included in the Community Services
Division recommended budget to begin implementation of the program.
Software Upgrades
Aging and Public Guardian Programs are upgrading to new software. The Aging programs are
replacing a 16 year old outdated and unsupported 4D software program. The software upgrade
is necessary in order to meet state program reporting requirements to maintain grant funding
and to maintain client history. The Public Guardian program is implementing a new case
management system. Both programs saw increases to their General Fund contribution in FY
2014-15 due to the new software. These costs should return to historical levels in FY 2015-16.
Recommended Staffing Changes
The Human Services Department is requesting position changes that better align personnel
allocations with the current funding, administrative and programmatic requirements of the
department. Position changes are detailed on the Personnel Allocation table, the majority of
which are funded with Federal, State and Realignment funding.
The Social Services Division requested the addition of a Paralegal for the Child Protective
Services program. The Community Services Division requested the addition of a Mental Health
Driver (FTE .5) for the Public Guardian program. These position requests have been placed on
hold and will be added to the department request list for possible funding in September.
Division Challenges
 The Public Housing Authority fund balance designated for administration costs will be
exhausted in FY 2014-15, resulting in the possible need for additional General Fund
support in future years. By utilizing the fund balance in FY 2014-15, the program will not
be sustainable into the future at the current service delivery level. The Health and
Human Services Agency is working with the state to determine possible program
options.
 The Multi-purpose Senior Services Program continues to experience increases in costs
without corresponding increases in revenue. The funding for this program is directly
related to the number of clients served and the program struggles to retain the number
of clients required to maximize funding. The Health and Human Services Agency is
evaluating options for the program.
 The Low-Income Home Energy Assistance (LIHEAP) and Weatherization programs
have seen increases in requirements and associated administration cost that is not
supported by the grant funding. The programs cannot sustain the current level of
operations without ongoing General Fund support.
 The state has fully realigned the funding provided for CalWorks, Foster Care, and
Adoption Assistance, which is now supported only with Federal and realignment funding.
This shift has a risk for counties should another economic downturn occur resulting in
decreases in sales tax and vehicle license fee revenue that may fall below the cost of
the client assistance payments.

The Recommended Budget represents an overall decrease of $17,638 or 35% in revenues and
an increase of $42,400 or 11% in appropriations when compared to the FY 2013-14 approved
budget. As a result, the Net County Cost has increased $60,038 or 18%.
The decrease in revenue is primarily due to the Veteran license plate special revenues being
lowered by approximately $12,500. The department had built up approximately $45,000 in fund
balance. This fund balance has been depleted over the last few years. The estimated revenue
that is available in this fund is approximately $7,500
The increase in appropriations is primarily related to a rise in health insurance costs.
The Recorder-Clerk/Registrar of Voters continues to act as the department head for Veteran
Affairs.

The Recommended Budget represents an overall decrease of $260,658 or 13% in revenues
and an increase of $61,009 or 2% in appropriations when compared to the FY 2013-14
approved budget. As a result, the Net County Cost has increased by $321,667 or 21%.
The department saw a large Net County Cost rise due to increases to employee salaries, health
insurance and retirement costs. There was also a decrease in revenues due to projected
reductions in donations from the Friends of the Library ($85,560) and other donations. As
donations are received, they will be brought to the Board for acceptance and added to the
budget at that time. The reduction in donations coincided with a reduction in circulating item
purchases (e.g. books, magazines, audios, etc.) for the libraries.
Grant funding from First 5 El Dorado is included in the department’s Recommended Budget at
the same amount as FY 2013-14 ($212,500). These grant funds are used to support early
literacy programs.
The budget does include two staffing changes to true up two underfills with the addition of two
Senior Library Assistant positions and the deletion of a Library Circulation Supervisor,
Supervisory Library Assistant (.8 FTE), and Office Assistant (.2 FTE).

The Recommended Budget represents an overall increase of $75,212 or 13% in revenues and
appropriations when compared to the FY 2013-14 adopted budget. There is no Net County
Cost for Child Support Services.
Increased revenues are primarily related to charges for service related to revenue recovery
services. Revenues for Child Support services are the same as FY 2013-14. Increased
appropriations are primarily related to retirement and health insurance.
Recommended Staffing Changes
Six vacant positions were deleted due to stagnate revenue from the State and Federal
Government. These positions had been unfunded vacancies over the last few years. The FY
2014-15 Child Support allocation from the State will not support these positions. The Chief
Administrative Office is recommending the deletion of these positions to bring the funded
personnel allocations in line with the revenue allocation from the State.
The following are the six vacant positions that are being recommended to be deleted:
 Child Support Supervisor
 Child Support Specialist I/II (5 FTEs)
 Legal Clerk
The Child Support Department will continue to have budget issues as long as State and Federal
revenues stay stagnate as expenses increase. Without an increase in revenues in the FY 2015-
16 budget further solutions will have to be explored to manage the department’s budget.

The budget does include three staffing changes to true up two underfills and one overfill. The
following are the changes:
 Addition of a Staff Services Specialist and the deletion of a Child Support Specialist I/II
(overfill).
 Addition of an Office Assistant I/II and the deletion of a Legal Clerk I/II (underfill).
 Addition of an Account Technician and the deletion of an Account Clerk II (underfill).
The department requested the addition of an Administrative Services Officer allocation.
However, at this time, revenue from the Federal and State governments will not support that
request.
