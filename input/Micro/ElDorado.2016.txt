The Recommended Budget represents an
overall increase of $126,600 or 25% in
revenues and an increase of $318,672 or
9% in appropriations when compared to the
FY 2015-16 Adopted Budget. As a result,
the Net County Cost has increased
$192,072 or 6%. This represents a status
quo budget.
Revenue increases are primarily from
timeshare assessment charges ($129,100)
and transfers from the department’s
automation special revenue fund ($42,200)
for a document scanning project as well as
other technology related expenses such as
computer equipment and software
licenses/subscriptions. Increases in
appropriations are due primarily to
negotiated salary and benefits and
recommended personnel allocation changes
($308,676).
Recommended Staffing Changes
The Assessor has requested a number of
personnel allocation changes at a net cost
of $93,956 in FY 2016-17 which is offset by
increased departmental revenues and
projected salary savings from position
vacancies. The annualized cost of the
requested allocation changes is
approximately $200,000 with $121,500
being offset by increased department
revenues, and $60,000 (approximately 30%
of costs incurred) offset by property tax
administration revenues that accrue to the
County’s general fund discretionary
revenues. The requested personnel
allocation changes include additions and
deletions that result in a net increase of 2.0
FTEs and include the following:
In order to provide an improved
management structure for the
department, as well as address impacts
related to the planned conversion and
ongoing support for the new Property
Tax Administration system, the
Assessor has requested the deletion of
the vacant Assistant Assessor allocation
and the addition of an Assistant
Assessor-Valuation, and an Assistant
Assessor-System Support. The
proposed classifications have been
discussed with the Human Resources
Director and are supported in concept.
The Community Development Agency
and Surveyor both report an anticipated
increase in future subdivision activity
which will result in increases in
assessment activities when newly
created lots are built out and later sold.
One FTE Appraiser position is
requested to address this workload.
There are still approximately 17,000
properties assessed at a Proposition 8
market value, which is lower than the
Proposition 13 value. Reviewing these
properties and either adjusting the
market value upward or fully restoring
the assessed base year value is a labor
intensive effort, but will result in
increased property tax revenue to the
County and other agencies. One FTE
Appraiser position is requested to
address this workload.
Because the requested allocation changes
provide an improved management structure
for the department, are relatively costneutral,
and are in direct support of
increasing the County’s discretionary
revenues, they have been included in the
Recommended Budget and are reflected in
the proposed FY 2016-17 personnel
allocation and organizational chart.

The Recommended Budget represents an
overall decrease of $26,630 or 5% in
revenues and $49,599 or 2% in
appropriations when compared to the FY
2015-16 approved budget. As a result, the
Net County Cost has decreased $22,969 or
less than 1%. This represents a status quo
budget.
The decrease in revenues is primarily
related to less accounting fees for financial
services related to the State Transportation
Development Act (TDA) and a reduced
rebate for the purchase card program. The
decrease in appropriations is primarily
related to a reduction in temporary
employees.
There are no staffing changes
recommended for the Department. The
Department does have one “unfunded”
Department Analyst position that the Board
approved during the budget workshops in
June 2015.

The Recommended Budget for the Board of
Supervisors represents an overall decrease
of $500 or 17% in revenues and $28,367 or
2% in appropriations when compared to the
FY 2015-16 approved budget. As a result,
the Net County Cost has decreased
$27,867 or less than 2%. The
Recommended Budget represents a “status
quo” budget.
The slight decrease in revenues is primarily
related to a reduction in Assessment
Appeals filing fees based on current year
actual revenues. The decrease in
appropriations is primarily related to a
reduction in general liability insurance.
The department included a request to make
personnel allocation changes to improve
operational efficiencies and provide
adequate support for current duties of the
Clerk’s office. The sharing of a clerical
support position with County Counsel was
also considered. These changes warrant
future consideration; however, they are not
recommended at this time based on the
Board of Supervisors direction to maintain
department budgets at status quo levels.
Additionally, the department requested a
secure filing system to replace the current
open-shelf file system at an estimated cost
of $26,000. No appropriations have been
included for this fixed asset purchase but it
is recommended that the department work
with the Facilities Division to incorporate
office modifications in the Building A/B
renovation project, when feasible, to allow
for the installation of a secured filing system
in the future.

In preparation for the new financial system,
the Chief Administrative Office moved
Economic Development, Parks & Trails,
River and the Rubicon programs back under
Department 02, the Chief Administrative
Office. In prior years, these divisions were
included in Department 11. The following
numbers represent the combined total of
Department 02 and Department 11.
The Recommended Budget represents an
overall decrease of $645,200 or 22% in
revenues and a decrease of $101,205 or
less than 1% in appropriations when
compared to the FY 2015-16 approved
budget. As a result, the Net County Cost is
increased by $543,995 or 6%.
The department request is based on a
status quo budget with the following
exceptions:
Addition of a Communications and
Outreach Manager (formerly called the
Public Information Officer) at an
estimated cost of $131,151
Increased County-wide utility costs of
approximately $125,000. PG&E rates
are increasing and with the upcoming
construction in Buildings A & B,
Facilities anticipates increased utility
costs in FY 2016-17.
The decrease in revenues in primarily
related to less grant funding for the Rubicon
Trail and is offset with reductions in services
and supplies, fixed assets and interfund
charges. Salaries and benefits increased
$249,802 due in part to the addition of the
Communications and Outreach Manager as
well as increases related to health care and
CalPERS.
Economic Development
The Recommended Budget for Economic
Development is $1,505,087 and has been
calculated using 51% of estimated Transient
Occupancy Tax (TOT) revenues for FY
2016-17 per General Plan Policy 10.1.6.4.
Recommended appropriations for Economic
Development include funding for the
operations of the Economic Development
office; $755K for the Economic
Development Opportunity Grant program;
$225K for business outreach services, a
regional fee study, a labor skills study and a
hotel market analysis; $100K for matching
funds for a potential broadband grant; and
contributions for the annual Wagon Train
event ($10K) and to CalTrans for Apple Hill
traffic control services during the peak
season.
Staffing Changes
The Department requested several
additions and deletions to true up existing
changes in staffing. These changes do not
result in any additional salary and benefit
costs or increased FTE allocations.
The department request includes the
addition of one Communications and
Outreach Manager (formerly called the
Public Information Officer). The adoption of
this job specification and salary range is
currently being finalized and will be brought
to the Board for approval at a later date.

The Recommended Budget represents an
overall increase of $16,200 or 4% in
revenues and an increase of $392,798 or
13% in appropriations when compared to
the FY 2015-16 Adopted Budget. As a
result, the Net County Cost has increased
$376,598 or 14%.
The Department request is based on a
status quo budget with the following
exception:
 Increased appropriations of
approximately $180,000 for contracted
legal services related to specific land
use cases currently being litigated.
Revenues remain relatively flat and are
based on current approved billing rates and
the projected need for legal services from
departments in the upcoming fiscal year.
Salaries and benefits increased $205,788
due to annual increases in health and
CalPERS.

The Recommended Budget for Human
Resources/Risk Management represents an
overall increase of $6,422,302 or 16% in
revenues and an increase of $6,713,589 or
16% in appropriations when compared to
the FY 2015-16 Adopted Budget. As a
result, the Net County Cost has increased
$291,287 or 16%. This increase is
attributable to the Human Resources
program budget and is due to increased
costs for professional and specialized
services including the Classification &
Compensation Study (total contract amount
of $358,000).
The most significant appropriation increases
are in Risk Management program costs for
health benefits ($4.3M), workers
compensation ($1.5M) and liability ($500K).
Funding for the Liability and Worker’s
Compensation programs is based on
actuarial analysis and recommendations of
Bickmore Risk Services and Consulting.
Professional and specialized services for
Human Resources are increasing by
$291,891. Funding for the classification and
compensation study in the amount of
$200,000 was included in the FY 2015-16
Adopted Budget. However, the department
anticipates that only $20,000 will be spent
on this contract prior to June 30th so the
recommended appropriations for FY 2016-
17 include $180,000 in carry over funding
from FY 2015-16. Additionally, costs for
legal services and the Civil Service
Commission are projected to increase
$65,000.
Staffing Changes
The Recommended Budget includes the
addition of a new Privacy Compliance
Officer to ensure that countywide practices,
procedures and training related to privacy
issues are compliant with mandatory
federal, state and local regulations and
requirements, including the Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
of 1996 (HIPAA). Also included is the
addition of 0.5 FTE Human Resources
Technician that was deleted in FY 2015-16.
Restoring the current 0.5 FTE position to full
time at a cost of approximately $28,000 will
allow Human Resources to provide much
needed support to departments requesting
assistance on personnel matters and
processing of personnel recruitments.
There is no change in Net County Cost for
the recommended staffing changes - the
new positions are funded by 1) leaving the
vacant Training & Organizational
Development Specialist position unfunded
and 2) recovering costs from other
departments (primarily Health & Human
Services and Sheriff) for services provided
by the Privacy Compliance Officer.

The Recommended Budget represents a
decrease of $53,600 or 80% in revenues
and an increase of $536,918 or 7% in
appropriations when compared to the FY
2015-16 Adopted Budget. (The decrease in
revenues is actually a shift to the accounting
class of expenditure abatement, described
below.) Overall, Net County Cost is
increasing by $590,518 or 7%. This
represents a status quo budget.
Revenues for Information Technologies (IT)
are from application and web programming
support services that are requested by and
directly billed to departments. These
charges are reflected as revenues in
charges for services and intrafund
abatements and are projected based on
current year actual activity levels. The
combined total for application and web

support services is increasing $46,400 over
FY 2015-16. The decrease in revenues is
actually a shift to an increase in expenditure
abatements:
All other IT program costs (mainframe,
network and PC support) are no longer
direct-billed to departments or recorded in
the Information Technologies budget.
Instead, the charges are processed through
the County’s A-87 Cost Allocation Plan
which is developed and administered by the
Auditor-Controller’s Office.
Increases in appropriations are primarily in
salaries and benefits. In FY 2015-16, a
number of positions were allocated but
unfunded, including the IT Director position.
In FY 2016-17, all allocated positions within
the department are funded with the
exception of the IT Director which is
anticipated to remain vacant in FY 2016-17.
Services and supplies remain flat at
$3,004,769.
Fixed assets are recommended at $279,200
and consist primarily of equipment related to
the Virtual Desktop Infrastructure project.
Staffing Changes
There is no net change to the total
personnel allocation for IT. However, the
Recommended Budget includes a number
of additions and deletions to true up the
department’s personnel allocations and to
convert classifications from the former
“departmental” assignments to the current
classifications for staff now centralized in IT.

The Recommended Budget represents an
overall decrease of $158,056 or 8% in
revenues and a decrease of $137,110 or
4% in appropriations when compared to the
FY 2015-16 approved budget. As a result,
the Net County Cost has increased by
$20,946 or 2%. This represents a status
quo budget.
The change in revenue and appropriations
in the Registrar of Voters is related to the
reduced funding for the Ease Grant and
Help America Vote Act (HAVA) Grant. El
Dorado County acts as the administrator of
the Ease Grant for 13 other counties. The
grant assists localities to explore
technological improvements for military and
overseas voters. The reduction in revenues
is offset with a corresponding reduction in
appropriations. The County does not
anticipate receiving HAVA funds in FY
2016-17. In addition, the Recorder-Clerk’s
division is decreasing the use of its
Modernization fund by $70,000 due to the
set-up work being completed for the e-lien
recording system. The increase to Net
County Cost can be attributed to increases
in salaries and benefits to cover employee
step increases and retirement and health
insurance increases.

The Recommended Budget represents an
increase of $99,566 or 5% in revenues and
an increase of $11,588 or less than 1% in
appropriations when compared to the FY
2015-16 Adopted Budget. As a result, the
Net County Cost has decreased $87,978 or
9%. This represents a status quo budget.
The increase in revenues is primarily related
to increases from timeshare assessment
charges ($76,140) and Transient
Occupancy Tax (TOT) revenues ($16,334).
Recommended expenditures remain flat in
accordance with direction to maintain a
status quo budget. It should be noted that
the Treasurer/Tax Collector’s requested
budget included the following requests that
warrant additional consideration but are not
recommended at this time:

The request for new positions is related to
the performance of additional audits of
Transient Occupancy Taxes (TOT) that may
result in increased revenues, and the
development of streamlined banking and
reconciliation processes for outside
departments that may result in cost savings.
The Chief Administrative Office has
requested additional information from the
department to better evaluate these
requests.
The department also requested funding for
a currently allocated limited term
Sr. Accountant position related to the
implementation of the FENIX system. This
position has been vacant for some time and
is recommended to be unfunded pending

determination by the ERP Executive
Steering Committee that there is a need to
fill the position this fiscal year. The cost of
the limited term position would be offset by
revenue from the County ACO fund for
FENIX system related costs.
New programs for business licenses and
TOT processes are provided in the new
FENIX system and Property Tax System,
respectively. The Chief Administrative
Office recommends the department work
with Information Technologies to address
these business needs and expedite the
implementation of these programs to the
extent possible with the new enterprise
systems.
Pending Issues and Policy
Considerations
The department has requested fixed assets
to replace existing equipment that is aging
and to provide improvements and
enhancements over current equipment. In
keeping with direction to maintain a status
quo budget, these items are not included in
the Recommended Budget. However, the
Chief Administrative Office acknowledges
the need to replace aging equipment and
has asked the department to explore
lease/financing options for the Remittance
Processing System which may help level
out costs over multiple years, allow for more
frequent technology refreshes (the current
equipment is over 10 years old), and allow
the lease/financing costs to be included and
recovered through the department’s cash
management fees. The CAO has requested
the department complete this research prior
to the June 13 special budget meeting so
that a recommendation regarding
replacement of the equipment can be made
at that time. If leasing is determined not to
be feasible, additional appropriations to
fixed assets in the amount of $134,059 may
be necessary.
Staffing Changes
The addition of 1.0 FTE Administrative
Technician and deletion of 1.0 FTE
Executive Secretary is recommended to
true up the department’s allocation.

The Recommended Budget represents an
increase of $10,488 or less than 1% in
revenues and an increase of $315,040 or
4% in appropriations when compared to the
FY 2015-16 approved budget. As a result,
the Net County Cost is increased by
$304,552 or 5%. This represents a status
quo budget.
The slight increase in revenue is due to an
increase in the department’s share of the
public safety sales tax.
The increase in appropriations is primarily
related to an increase in Services and
Supplies of $163,138. This amount
includes the department’s contract with the
Center for Violence Free Relationships for
victim support services, connectivity to the
courts communication system (CLETS), and
general liability. Some of these costs were
incurred in FY 2015-16 but not included in
the budget. Salaries and benefits are
primarily increasing in worker’s
compensation ($53,000) and retirement
($81,000).
The recommended budget includes several
position allocation changes that reflect the
District Attorney’s continued efforts to
restructure his office, increasing the use of
technology to realize efficiency. The budget
includes two vacant, unfunded Paralegal
allocations. As a result of restructuring
efforts, the District Attorney expects to
delete two vacant allocations over the
course of the next year. The savings in the
current budget associated with these
positions is approximately $185,000, which
will become ongoing savings once the
allocations are deleted.

The FY 2016-17 Recommended Budget is
based on the FY 2015-16 approved budget
with a small increase of $20 based on mail cost applied charges.

The Recommended Budget represents an
overall increase of $126,748 or 2% in
revenues and an increase of $1,398,683 or
8% in appropriations when compared to the
FY 2015-16 approved budget. As a result,
the Net County Cost is increased by
$1,271,935 or 11%. This represents a
status quo budget.
The increase in revenue is the result of
additional AB109 funding and Youthful
Offender Block Grant funding.
The increase in appropriations is primarily
related to increased salaries and benefits
($1,301,286). The majority of this increase
is related to permanent salaries ($873K),
retirement ($255K), worker’s compensation
costs ($140K), and health insurance
($129K). Much of the increase in
permanent salaries is due to the fact that
the department held several positions
vacant in order to achieve savings in FY
2015-16.
The department included a request to make
personnel allocation changes to improve
efficiency and provide support for revenuegenerating
grants and federal claiming
activities. The changes result in no net
increase to the department’s allocation and
are expected to result in an overall savings
of approximately $5,000. These changes
are recommended and have been reflected
in the proposed personnel allocation and
organizational chart. One of the
recommended adjustments is the deletion of
one Deputy Probation Officer I/II – Field and
the addition of one Probation Assistant. This
change would save the department
approximately $14,000 annually. However,
the job classification has not been
established by the Board of Supervisors so
the addition is noted in italics on the
personnel allocation chart.
Departmental requests that are not
recommended at this time include $296K in
capital improvement projects:
New carpeting for South Lake Tahoe
Office ($43K)
Secure parking for Placerville Office
($15K)
Placerville Juvenile Hall shower upgrade
($50K)
Placerville Juvenile Hall security camera
upgrade ($54K)
Heating for recreation yard at Juvenile
Treatment Center in South Lake Tahoe
($80K)
South Lake Tahoe Juvenile Treatment
Center security camera upgrade ($54K)
These projects have not been included in
the proposed work plan for the Facilities
Division. All remaining capital funds are
being used for deferred maintenance
projects identified in the VANIR study.
Currently, funding has not been identified
for any new department requests.

The Recommended Budget represents an
overall decrease of $402 or less than 1% in
revenues and an increase of $128,745 or
3% in appropriations when compared to the
FY 2015-16 approved budget. As a result,
the Net County Cost is increased by
$128,343 or 4%. This represents a status
quo budget.
The slight change in revenue is due to
cumulative minor increases and decreases
across several line items and does not
represent a significant change to the
department’s overall revenue picture.
Appropriation increases are spread across
several line items, including salaries ($62K),
worker’s compensation ($6K) and health
insurance ($25K). The increase in fixed
assets ($17K) is a one-time expense for
leasehold improvements related to the
department’s relocation of the Placerville
Office. The increase in other financing uses

The Recommended Budget represents an
overall decrease of $2,135,690 or 12% in
revenues and an increase of $3,256,765 or
5% in appropriations when compared to the
FY 2015-16 approved budget. As a result,
the Net County Cost is increased by
$5,392,455 or 12%. The increase in Net
County Cost is due primarily to increases in
countywide costs including negotiated
salary and benefits, combined with
reductions in revenue. The Recommended
Budget therefore represents a “status quo”
NCC budget.
The largest source of revenue for the
Sheriff’s Office continues to be Proposition
172 - Public Safety Sales Tax revenue.
This revenue is increasing by approximately
1% in the Recommended Budget. The
CAO’s office closely monitors this revenue
stream and if any adjustments are
necessary, they will be made in the
addenda process.
The reductions in revenue are related to
Homeland Security Grant funds, Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
funds related to the King Fire ($585K),
Court security revenue ($645,000) and
Rural and Small Counties funding ($520K).
Revenue related to Homeland Security and
Court Security may be increased during the
addenda process, but any increase will be
offset with appropriation increases.
Overall salaries and benefits are increasing
by $3,515,204. The majority of this increase
is due to increases in permanent salaries
($2,033,000), retirement ($1,259,000), and
worker’s compensation ($687,000). In
addition to the increased countywide costs
noted above, a reduction in the assumed
salary and benefits savings, from $2.9M in
FY 2015-16 to $1.1M in FY 2016-17, is
contributing to the increase in salaries and
benefits.
Services and supplies are increasing
$728,000 overall related to increased
general liability costs, fuel and vehicle costs,
and the inclusion of lease payments for two
body scanners at the jails. The reduction in

The Recommended Budget for the Court
Maintenance of Effort represents a
reduction in revenue of $92,938 or 8% and
an increase in appropriations of $250,809 or
11% from the FY 2015-16 approved budget.
As a result, the Net County Cost is
increased $343,747 or 29%.
The increase in appropriations is due to an
increase in expenses for indigent defense.
The Chief Administrative Office issued a
Request for Proposals (RFP) for conflict
attorney services for indigent clients. The
Board awarded the contract to El Dorado
Law, A Professional Law Corporation.
Rather than contract directly with the conflict
panel attorneys, El Dorado Law will
administer the panel of 11 attorneys as
subcontractors. In addition, El Dorado Law
will provide administrative support and will
collect and report data to the County in
order to assist in better evaluation and
management of these services. Individual
attorney pay will be increased by 15%,
commensurate with increases received by
most County employees over the past
several years.

The Recommended Budget represents an
increase $20,255 or 2% in revenues and an
increase of $67,058 or 5% in appropriations
when compared to the FY 2015-16
approved budget. As a result, the Net
County Cost increased by $46,803 or 10%.
This represents a status quo budget.
The increase in revenue is primarily related
to an increase in estimated Unclaimed Gas
Tax funding of $15,395 for FY 2016-17
(totaling $288,816) and is based on the
actual amount received in FY 2015-16.
The increase in appropriations of $67,058 is
primarily related to salaries ($35,679) and
services and supplies ($27,489), primarily
related to a USDA contract increase of
$10,000 (restored from previous year
reduction) and vehicles and fuel increase of
$17,601 to more accurately reflect actual
vehicle usage through County Fleet rates
for maintenance and fuel use.

Prior to FY 2015-16, the CDA
Administration and Finance unit was
included in the Development Services
Division (Department “34”), along with
Development Services, Long-Range
Planning, and Code Enforcement. In order
to more cleanly account for activities and
Agency wide financial matters, “Department
35” was created to solely include CDA
Administration and Finance activities and
will be utilized going forward. This mirrors
the Administrative and Finance model of the
Health and Human Services Agency.
The recommended budget for the CDA
Administration and Finance Division
represents a decrease in revenue and
appropriations of $475,083 or 10%,
representing no change to Net County Cost
that remains at $0.
Major changes to revenue include a
reduction in Charges for other services of
$268,192 based on reduced overall
administrative costs for charges to other
divisions in CDA. An additional decrease in
operating transfers of $327,000 is attributed
to less funding being needed for the “P3”
system from fund balance transfers from the
Garbage Franchise Fee fund (partially paid
for in FY 2015-16). There was an increase
of $120,000 for other license and permit
revenue (new revenue source) that is
attributed to a new fee component included
on permits as a “technology fee” that was
approved by the Board on May 3, 2016.
This revenue source will be utilized to pay
for oversight and implementation of the new
“P3” permitting system, and similar
technology programs implemented by the
Agency to enhance services and help
streamline operations.
Changes to appropriations include an
increase in salaries and benefits of
$246,355, primarily related to increases in
salaries tied to standard labor agreement
increases ($83,000), retirement costs
($33,000), health insurance ($59,000) and
other compensation tied to anticipated
retirement payouts of unused leave
balances ($58,000). Additional decreases in
services and supplies ($340,216) are
primarily related to the aforementioned
decreased “P3” costs along with a decrease
in computer equipment ($91,000). This

All figures below are adjusted comparisons
versus Fiscal Year 2015-16 that remove the
CDA Administration and Finance figures as
these revenues and appropriations have
been accounted for in a separate section of
this document.
The recommended budget for the General
Fund portion of the Development Services
Division represents an increase in revenue
of $2,459,292 and an increase in
expenditures of $2,336,707. As a result,
Net County Cost is decreased by $122,590
or 5%. Total Net County Costs for this
portion of the Division is $3,300,738.
Major changes to revenue include an
increase in permit and franchise fees of
$2,031,987 related to a large increase in
permit activity coupled with a rate increase
for permits approved by the Board on May
3, 2016. The new fees will go into effect for
FY 2016-17 and better recover costs of
providing permit related services. There is a
decrease in charges for services ($316,695)
primarily due to decreased work by Long
Range Planning (LRP) staff for work done
that would be reimbursed from the Missouri
Flat Master Circulation and Financing Plan
(MC&FP) account, Road Fund, Road CIP
and Erosion Control ($268,000).
Additional changes to revenue include an
increase of $291,871 as miscellaneous
revenue primarily tied to developer funding
agreements ($270,000) for work overseen
by LRP staff with offsetting consultant work.
Lastly, there is an increase in operating
transfers of $452,129 due to an increase in
Planning billings for privately initiated
Environmental Impact Reports (EIR) work
($160,000 transferred from Planning special
revenue fund) and $132,000 as a transfer
from CSA #10 garbage franchise fees to
fund the trash amendment portion of the
County’s storm water program (housed in
LRP).
Major chanes to appropriations include an
increase of $931,189 in salaries and
benefits tied to the addition of 1.0 FTE Code
Enforcement Officer allocation at the
request of the Board, negotiated labor
agreement increases, and fully funding all
allocated positions (there was a vacancy
rate built into the budget for FY 2015-16 to
meet reduction targets). An additional
$100,000 has been programmed at the
direction of the Board to help with
Community Planning functions. There is an
increase in services and supplies
($725,855) almost entirely related to
appropriations included as “special
department expenses” that are discussed
below under “Pending issues and policy
considerations” ($546,000), and contracts
for EIR work as mentioned above
($119,000).
Additional appropriation adjustments are
seen through an increase in interfund
allocated charges ($42,974) related to Road
Fund staff working on storm water permit
activities, operating transfers increasing
($155,827) related to permit fee revenue
being utilized to fund the additional Code

The Recommended Budget represents an
overall decrease of $517,597 or 16% in
revenues and appropriations when
compared to the FY 2015-16 approved
budget. There is no Net County Cost for
this department. This represents a status
quo budget.
Changes to revenue are almost entirely
related to a reduction in operating transfers
($522,000) related to less use of CSA 10
Garbage Franchise Fees to balance
appropriations to maintain a zero Net
County Cost. Other revisions include a
decrease in charges for services ($59,000)
related to staff charges to CSA 10 and CSA
3, and an increase in federal revenue
($75,000) for Local Primacy Agency grant
funding.
Changes to appropriations include a
decrease in interfund revenue ($1,082,617)
largely related to reduced charges from the
staff in CSA 10 and 3 being re-distributed,
and no fixed assets being requested
($55,000). These decreases are partially
offset by an increase in salaries and
benefits ($581,000) related to a
redistribution of Division staff (offsetting
reduction in Fund Type 12), and a slight
increase in services and supplies ($10,000).
Fund 12 – General Fund
The Recommended Budget represents an
overall decrease of $1,980,416 or 21% in
revenues and appropriations when
compared to the FY 2015-16 approved
budget. There is no Net County Cost for
this department. This represents a status
quo budget.
The use of fund balance is being reduced
by $1,188,043 or 27%.
Reductions to revenue are primarily related
to a reduction in charges for services
($1,076,000) that ties to the General Fund
portion of the Divisions adjustments (shift in
personnel and reimbursable work being
decreased), and the reduced use of Fund
Balance needed as noted above.
Decreases in appropriations are primarily
related to reductions in salaries and benefits
($476,000) and operating transfers
($1,608,000) related to the shift in
employees to the General Fund units in the
Division and a decrease in Myers Landfill
closure costs. Slight increases in
appropriations that partially offset these
decreases include services and supplies
($172,000) for purchase and distribution of
equipment to help increase recycling and
composting.
Staffing Changes
Several staffing changes in the Division are
being proposed to “true-up” existing
allocations to accurately reflect how
positions are currently filled, or to better
meet the needs of the Agency. These
changes include two add/delete revisions;
add 1.0 FTE Environmental Management
Programs Manager, delete 1.0 FTE vacant
Deputy Director of Environmental
Management, and add 1.0 FTE
Development Aide I/II, delete 1.0 FTE filled
Administrative Technician (true-up). Lastly,
the recommendation is to delete 1.0 Office
Assistant I/II, for a net reduction of 1.0 FTE
in the Division.

Within the General Fund programs in the
Transportation Division, the Recommended
Budget represents an increase of $530,744
or 30.2% in revenues and an increase of
$437,316 or 18.9% in appropriations when
compared to the FY 2015-16 approved
budget. As a result, the Net County Cost is
decreasing by $93,428 or 16.9%, for a total
Net County Cost of $458,050. This
represents a status quo budget.
County Engineer
The Recommended Budget for the County
Engineer includes an increase in revenues
of $525,744 and an increase in
appropriations of $399,299 resulting in a
decrease in Net County Cost of $126,445.
Net County Cost for this program is
$352,160. The increase in revenue is
related to an increase in projected activity
for developer funded work related to new
subdivisions and adjusted fees, with a
lesser increase in appropriations related to
consultant contracts for engineering work
that is anticipated to outpace staff
availability for such work.
Cemetery Operations
The Recommended Budget for Cemetery
operations includes an increase in revenues
of $5,000 and an increase in appropriations
of $38,017 resulting in a Net County Cost
increase of $33,017, for a Program Net
County Cost of $105,890. Slight increases
to revenue are seen through increased fees
approved by the Board, with an increase in
appropriations tied to increased cemetery
ground maintenance for deferred
maintenance work.

The Fish and Game Commission has historically been funded with Wildlife violation
fines. These revenue sources are typically less than $6,000 annually. The Fish and
Game Commission requested additional general funds in the amount of $20,000 in FY
2016-17. These additional funds are included in the Recommended Budget. The funds
are proposed to be used on the following projects:
 Wood Duck Habitat Improvement Project – Building, monitoring and maintenance of
Wood Duck nesting boxes. The program would provide artificial nesting sites for
habitat deprived Wood Ducks and would engage students in additional educational
opportunities addressing the environment. Estimated cost $2,000
 Grant Proposal – To improve the ability to fund important projects within the County,
the Commission would like to contract with an individual to develop grants.
Estimated cost $4,000
 Finnon Lake Fisheries Project – Purchase of $3,200 of rainbow trout and additional
monies for sampling equipment, like crayfish traps. Estimated cost $3,600
 Wildlife Resource Protection & Preservation Project – To reduce illegal harvest and
aide in the apprehension of poachers, purchase equipment to assist in reducing
illegal harvest. Estimated cost $3,200
 Game Processing Project – Establish a fund to process illegal game seized by
California Fish and Wildlife Warden. The intent of this project is to work in
conjunction with the Health and Human Services organization to provide additional
food to various County support food programs. Estimated cost $2,000
 Baron Lake Fisheries Project – To provide family oriented fishing opportunities in the
eastern portion of El Dorado County, establishes a fish stocking program for Baron
Lake. Estimated Cost $3,300
 Administrative Funds – Clerical support, printing and travel expenses. Estimated
cost $2,000

The Recommended Budget represents an
overall decrease of $1,468 or 2% in
revenues and a decrease of $7,577 or less
than 1% in appropriations when compared
to the FY 2015-16 approved budget. As a
result, the Net County Cost is decreased by
$6,109 or less than 1% compared to the FY
2015-16 approved budget. This represents
a status quo budget.
The slight decrease in revenue is primarily
related to decreased charges for parcel map
inspections ($8,185) mostly offset by an
increase in charges for Geographic
Information System (GIS) service fees
($6,367), both billed to the Transportation
Division for work related to various projects.
Overall appropriations are decreasing by
$7,577. Salaries and benefits are increasing
by $14,889, primarily related to an
anticipated long-term employee retiring with
an associated payout of unused vacation
time. For FY 2016-17, the budget continues
to include $10,000 for extra help to address

2016-17 Summary of Department Programs

seasonal map checking work and to assist
GIS staff with data entry work associated
with General Plan Implementation efforts.
Services and supplies are decreasing by
$6,012 primarily related to decreased costs
for maintenance of computer systems
($8,457) and computer equipment ($3,200),
partially offset with an increase in general
liability insurance ($5,273). Intrafund
transfers are increasing by $16,155
primarily due to information technology
program charges related to converting data
for the LMIS conversion to a new program
($16,000). Intrafund abatements are
decreasing by $33,109 related to
reimbursement for additional staff support
work on a new Parcel Map, Permitting and
Planning (P3) system being implementing
through the County’s Community
Development Agency that will replace the
aforementioned LMIS system.


The Recommended Budget represents
an overall decrease of $61,266 or 1%
in revenues and appropriations when
compared to the FY 2015-16 Adopted
Budget. There is no Net County Cost
for Child Support programs. All but
$5,000 of the expenditures in the
Revenue Recovery Program are offset

by revenues from charges for services.
This represents a status quo budget.
Decreased revenues are primarily
related to a reduction in the Electronic
Data Processing/Maintenance and
Operations (EDP) allocation for Child
Support Services. Expenditures in that
program have also been reduced so
the Net County Cost remains at zero.
The department has also included
projected salary savings of 3.9% from
position vacancies in the Child Support
program based on their historical
vacancy rate.
Staffing Changes
The Recommended Budget includes the
deletion of one vacant Accounting
Technician position.

Administration Division was created to
provide efficiencies in administrative and
fiscal support to all the various programs
across the agency. The division passes
these fiscal and administrative costs to
programs within the agency based on direct
program salaries. All Administrative Division
costs are funded from state, federal,
realignment, donations/fees, and General
Fund.
The total Recommended Budget for the
Administration Division represents a
decrease of revenues of $250,193 or 6%
and an increase in appropriations of
$252,616 or 6% when compared to the FY
2015-16 approved budget. As a result, the
Net County Cost is increasing $502,809.
This represents a status quo budget.
At the beginning of the year the Division
calculates an Indirect Cost Rate (ICR) that
is charged out to all Divisions in the Health
and Human Services agency based on
direct salary dollars. Due to fluctuations in
actual salary dollars spent throughout the
year, sometimes the department collects
more revenue than necessary which rolls
into the General Fund as fund balance and
will be used to fund the Net County Cost in
future years.

The total Recommended Budget represents
a decrease in revenues and appropriations
of $3,106,856 or 8% when compared to the
FY 2015-16 adopted budget. There is a
General Fund contribution of $16,510 for
County match requirements. This
represents a status quo budget.
The decrease in revenues and
appropraiations is mainly due to lower fund
balance for the MHSA program. The
program has less fund balance because it is
catching up on approved past spending
plans.
The Behavioral Health Division is focusing
on shifting client services to Mental Health
Services Act (MHSA) programs for
expanded service delivery which could
decrease expenditures in Traditional
programs. The shift to MHSA focused
programs is in correlation to the approved
plan and allows the Behavioral Health
Division to develop more comprehensive
recovery-oriented programs for the
underserved target populations.
The Behavioral Health Division is submitting
an Innovation Plan to fund the Community
Hub Program. This plan will need the Board
of Supervisors’ approval and State approval
prior to implementing the project. For more
information on the Community Hub Program
please visit the budget page for the Public
Health Division.
Staffing Changes
The Behavioral Health Division is requesting
an increase of 5.9 FTEs that will help better
align personnel allocations with the current
funding, administrative and programmatic
requirements of the division’s programs.
The positions are paid with special revenue,
so there are no General Fund dollars
allocated for the positions. The department
is requesting two new Mental Health
Workers in South Lake Tahoe for the
Traditional Behavioral Health Programs,
which are funded with federal revenues,
realignment/state revenues, and charges for
services. The positions will be part of the
Intensive Case Management Team that
serves the Adult Full Service Partnership
clients (highest acuity clients) by providing
them the services they need to stabilize and
gain skills to better manage their symptoms
while living in the community rather than
being placed in a more costly and restrictive
higher level of care.
In the FY 2016-17 Budget, the Behavioral
Health Division has 1.03 unfunded
positions: Senior Department Analyst (1.0
FTE) and Medical Records Technician (.03
FTE). Both positions are located in the
Traditional Behavioral Health programs.
Traditional Behavioral Health Programs
The Recommended Budget for the
Traditional Behavioral Health Programs is
$12,572,252, which represents an increase
of approximately $338,800 or 3% when
compared to the FY 2015-16 adopted
budget. The Traditional programs are
primarily funded by federal revenues,
realignment/state revenues, and charges for
services to other counties and private
payers. The increase to the traditional
programs can largely be attributed to the
program budgeting for more psychiatric
beds for out of County patients.
The Traditional Behavioral Health Program
funding continues to present a challenge

since the majority of traditional funds are
spent on out of county placements and
placements in the Psychiatric Health
Facility. Currently, two clients are placed in
the state hospitals with an estimated cost of
$475,000 per year.
Finding local alternatives remains a
challenge as demand for bed space is
increasing statewide. El Dorado County
does not have the provider capacity and
while HHSA recently posted an RFI relative
to local Mental Health Rehabilitation Center
services, one-time startup costs will likely be
a challenge.
Mental Health Services Act (MHSA)
Program
The Recommended Budget for the MHSA
Programs is $17,359,667 and represents an
overall decrease of approximately
$3,010,200 or 15% when compared to the
FY 2015-16 adopted budget. The decrease
in the budget is primarily due to less fund
balance available for the MHSA program. In
prior years, the MHSA program would not
have an adopted plan until later in the fiscal
year. Spending could not happen until the
plan was adopted resulting in savings that
would roll into the program’s fund balance at
the end of each fiscal year. Now the plans
are being adopted earlier in the fiscal year
and the MHSA program is catching up on its
past planned spending as MHSA services
and expenditures have increased as
follows:

The Fiscal Year 2016-17 MHSA plan update
is anticipated to be adopted in June 2016.
MHSA programs are reviewed on an annual
basis to determine which programs are
successful (many of the programs are
relatively new) in meeting program
outcomes. The Behavioral Health Division
has been reassessing MHSA services and
reviewing outcomes to ensure sufficient
appropriations are available in future years
to continue with the current staffing levels
and contract expenditures.
Alcohol and Drug Programs
The Recommended Budget for Alcohol and
Drug Programs is $4,285,199, which
represents an overall decrease of
approximately $435,500 or 9% when
compared to the FY 2015-16 adopted
budget. Alcohol and Drug Programs are
funded primarily by realignment funds and
federal revenues. The decrease is primarily
due to Public Health funds being transferred
to the Traditional Behavioral Health
programs for state hospital beds instead of
the Alcohol and Drug programs.
Pending Issues and Policy
Considerations
AB 403 (Stone)/Continuum of Care Reform
AB 403 is a comprehensive reform effort to
make sure that youth in foster care have
their day-to-day physical, mental, and
emotional needs met; that they have the
greatest chance to grow up in permanent
and supportive homes; and they have the
opportunity to grow into self-sufficient,
successful adults. The full impact of AB 403
is unknown, but all indications are there will
not be sufficient funding from the State to
meet the new mandates. A fiscal analysis
conducted by the State of California
Legislative Analysis Office concluded that
AB 403 would have a major fiscal impact on
mental health services in the tens of millions
of dollars statewide, and that due to 1991
Realignment, the responsibility of providing
services rests on the counties. However, on
behalf of counties, the California Behavioral
Health Director’s Association submitted a
request for $370 million in additional funding
statewide to offset the impact of AB 403 on

local behavioral health departments. At this
time the State has not responded to this
request.
Services for Children’s Welfare Services
Clients
Alcohol and Drug Programs will be
providing a clinician to Children’s Welfare
Services clients. This position is funded with
the 10% 1991 Realignment transfer
authority to Behavioral Health from Public
Health.
American Society of Addiction Medicine
Criteria
The Alcohol and Drug Program is pursuing
training in the American Society of Addiction
Medicine (ASAM) Criteria which is the most
widely used and comprehensive set of
guidelines for placement, continued stay
and transfer/discharge of patients with
addiction and co-occurring conditions. The
ASAM criteria is a required element of the
proposed Organized Delivery Service
(ODS) for Alcohol and Drug Program Medi-
Cal waiver that is in the pilot stage with the
State. The ODS waiver brings additional
ADP services to Medi-Cal beneficiaries
through the State medi-cal plan update. The
County has not yet opted into the program
and is currently reviewing the feasibility of
participating in the ODS medi-cal waiver
program.

The Recommended Budget represents an
increase of $1,136,668 or 2% in revenues
and an increase of $3,448,105 or 6% in
appropriations when compared to the FY
2015-16 approved budget. As a result, the
Net County Cost increased by $2,311,437
or 138%. This represents a status quo
budget.
The increase in revenues is due to
increased state and federal revenue in
Medi-Cal and Cal Fresh allocations, 2011
Protective Services Realignment for Child
Welfare Services and Housing Support
Program grant.
The increase in appropriations is primarily
due to the division now being charged for
County overhead costs through the
County’s Cost Allocation Plan (A-87). For
more information about the A-87 charges
please reference the subtitle called “County
Cost Allocation Plan Changes for HHSA” on
the first page of the Health and Human
Services Agency budget write-up. The FY
20161-17 A87 charges for Social Services
totals $2,759,510 plus $285,051 for Public
Guardian. Overall salaries and benefits
have increased $1,792,057 due to step
increases, health care and retirement costs.
Other charges have decreased $2,066,142
due to changes in foster care funding.
Staffing Changes
The Departmetn is requesting an increase
of 1.0 FTEm Social Services Supervisor to
help align personnel allocations with the
current funding, administrative and
programmatic requirements.
The Division has 1.0 unfunded FTE, an
Employment & Training Worker in the CAL
Works program.
Community Services - Fund Type 11
The Recommended Budget represents an
overall increase of $661,268 or 8% in
revenue and appropriations when compared
to the FY 2015-16 approved budget. The
increase is related to additional funds from
the federal government for the Low-Income
Home Energy Program (LIHEAP)
($500,000), and fees from the senior
daycare program due to higher attendance.
The General Fund Contribution request has
a net increase of $46,547 from the level of
General Fund support included in the FY
2015-16 Adopted Budget. The increase in
General Fund Contribution is for the County
share of cost for the additional LIHEAP
program funding.
Staffing Changes
The Community Services division is
requesting position changes that will help
better align personnel allocations with the
current funding, administrative and
programmatic requirements.
In the FY 2016-17 Recommended Budget,
the Community Services program has 3.0
unfunded positions: Employment & Training
Worker I/II (1 FTE), Employment & Training
Worker III (1 FTE) and Program Assistant (1
FTE). The Employment & Training positions
are located in the Workforce Innovation and
Opportunity Act program and the Program
Assistant is located in the Senior Daycare
program.
IHSS & Public Housing Authority – BOS
Governed Special Districts Fund Type 12
The Recommended Budget represents an
overall increase of approximately $93,706
or 2% in revenues and appropriations when
compared to the FY 2015-16 approved
budget.
The increase in revenues are primarily
related to an increased use of fund balance
($177K), offset with reduced federal funding
($120K). The General Fund Contribution in
Fund Type 12 is $66,650, which is an
increase of $8,720 for the IHSS Public
Authority.
Pending Issues and Policy
Considerations
Foster Parent Recruitment and Retention
Services Program
The Child Welfare Service program
submitted a plan and was awarded
additional funding for the Foster Parent
Recruitment and Retention Services
Program (FPRRS), as a precursor to AB
403 and the dissolution of the use of higher
level Group Homes for long term foster care
placement. HHSA was awarded $96K (it
should be noted that most, counties,
including El Dorado, only received
approximately 10% of the funding
requested). The plan includes a Social
Worker for the recruitment and support of
foster parents in a “Hub” style environment.
A key element in the plan is to identify and

recruit a lead foster family who should
receive a monthly stipend to provide primary
support to new foster families.
Through Federal and Protective Services
Realignment revenue, the division is
increasing its participation in the AB 2129
Foster Parent Training and Recruitment
Program, which helps concentrate efforts on
recruitment, training and retaining additional
local foster family homes.
AB 403 Continuum of Care Reform
AB 403 Continuum of Care Reform reworks
the Child Welfare System for the care and
placement of foster care children. Minimal
funding has been issued for start-up costs
with the long term operational funding
expected to be provided by savings from
lower Foster Care placement costs. Due to
the increased complexity of child welfare
cases, as the State Department of Social
Services complies with new legislation, the
savings from reduced placement costs
alone will not be sufficient to fund the
required increased casework. Katie A.(Katie
A. requires casworkers to perform
assessments for children who are either in
foster care or at imminent risk of being
placed into foster care for referrals to more
intensive mental health services) is also
being reworked into AB 403, and Social
Services and Behavioral Health are
collaborating on service options.
Implementation of AB 12
All counties considered the implementation
of AB 12, which was passed in 2010 and
extended foster care services to 21 years
old for children in foster care, as a
mandated and fully reimbursable program.
However, in March 2016 counties were
notified that as a result of 2011 realignment,
this is not a mandated program and only
reimbursable up to a cap amount. At the
time of the budget submission, all counties
were waiting for the cap amount from the
State Department of Social Services.
Depending on the cap amount and current
expenditures, HHSA may be required to
reduce AB 12 services, which has been one
of the most successful programs in
preventing homelessness among aged out
foster youth.
Preventing Sex Trafficking and
Strengthening Families Act: Commercial
Sexual Exploitation of Children
HHSA continues to participate in a multi
departmental collaboration to implement the
requirements of the Preventing Sex
Trafficking and Strengthing Families Act. As
a result of these efforts, HHSA was
awarded approximately $290,000 in
additional funding, some of which is being
used for specialized services and placement
options of Commercial Sexual Exploitation
of Children victims allowing the children to
remain local. The funding will also provide
specialized support services for identified
victims of sex trafficking, and community
education in the recognition of signs and
prevention of incidents.
Child Welfare Case Reviews
The State has shifted the responsibility for
Child Welfare Case Review to counties.
Beginning in August 2015, California
counties became responsible for completing
qualitative case reviews for child welfare
services. These reviews are modeled after
the Federal Child and Family Services
Reviews conducted by the Administration
for Child and Families, Children’s Bureau.
These case reviews, coupled with the
quantitative data already available, will be
part of a larger continuous quality
improvement effort in the state. Funding
was not sufficient to cover all costs
associated with the workload increase.
Housing Support Program
The CalWORKs program received new
funding that will target the reduction of
homelessness for those who may not
qualify for traditional CalWORKs housing
support. HHSA received a $470,000 federal
allocation for the Housing Support Program
which will provide housing and other
support services for families in need. Some
of the allowable costs are rent and rental
deposits, utility deposits, moving costs, and
credit repair services to help families find
affordable and sustainable homes.
Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act
Golden Sierra has decreased El Dorado
County’s funding in the Workforce
Innovation and Opportunity Act by 26%. The
Grant for FY 2016-17 decreased funding for
program staff while the client service output
requirement doubled. Additionally, the grant
included a new leveraging component that
may require General Fund dollars if the
program is unable to meet the new client
service requirement level. The rules to
leverage General Fund dollars to identify
additional grant support to clients has very
specific requirements and will be
challenging to meet. HHSA is concerned
that the department will not be able to meet
the requirements of this grant with the
current staffing and funding. The
department anticipates that this program
may require a higher level of ongoing
General Fund support, or other options may
need to be developed.

The Recommended Budget represents an
increase of $86,777 or 7% in revenues and
an increase of $768,772 or 28% in
appropriations when compared to the FY
2015-16 approved budget. As a result, the
Net County Cost increased by $681,995 or
46%. This represents a status quo budget.
The increase in revenues is primarily due to
the cities’ contribution for the shared
expenditures of the Animal Services
program including A-87 overhead costs.
The increase in appropriations went up
primarily due to the division now being
charged for County overhead costs through
the County’s Cost Allocation Plan (A-87).
For more information about the A-87
charges please reference the subtitle called
“County Cost Allocation Plan Changes for
HHSA” on the first page of the Health and
Human Service Agency budget write-up.
The A87 charges for Animal Services total
$627,598. Salaries and benefits also
increased slightly ($79,014) due to
increased health and retirement costs.
In the last year, Animal Services has seen
its workload increase while achieving
important outcomes. In 2015, Animal
Services received over 36,000 incoming
calls for service, up from approximately
33,000 calls from the prior year, which is
approximately a 9.1% increase. In Fiscal
Year 2014-15, the program took in over
4,800 animals with a live release rate of
91.2% (excludes feral and owner request
euthanasia), which exceeds the national
benchmark of 90% to be considered a “No
Kill Shelter”.
Public Health Fund Type 11
The Recommended Budget represents an
increase of $1,659,150 or 7% in revenues
and appropriations. There is no Net County
Cost associated with these programs.
The increase is related to the launching of
the Community Hub Program. The funds
for the Community Hub program are coming
from multiple programs: Mental Health
Service Act Innovation funds, Maternal
Child Adolescent Health funds, First 5 grant
funds, etc. (for more information on the
Community Hub programs please look at
the Pending Issues and Policy
Considerations section). In other words,
there are dedicated revenues for the
appropriations related to the Community
Hub program. The budget includes a
$3,502,194 General Fund contribution for
various programs (e.g. Jail and Juvenile
Hall medical services contract and county
matches for state health programs).
Staffing Changes
The Public Health Division is requesting an
increase of 11.5 FTEs to better align
personnel allocations with the current
funding, administrative and programmatic
requirements of the Division’s Public Health
programs. Nearly all of the 11.5 FTEs are
related to the new Community Hub
Program. The program will be utilizing five
community health advocates, five public
health nurses and a supervising public
health nurse (for more information on the
Community Hub program please look at the
Pending Issues and Policy Considerations
section).
In the FY 2016-17 Budget, the Public Health
Division has 1.2 unfunded positions:
Nutritionist (0.6 FTE) and Program Assistant
(.6 FTE). Both positions are located in the
Women, Infants, and Children (WIC)
program.
CSA #3, CSA #7 and Ambulance Billing –
Fund Type 12
The Recommended Budget represents a
decrease of $604,845 or 3% in revenues
and appropriations. There is no Net Count
Cost associated with these programs.
Revenues for CSA #3 and CSA #7 prehospital
medical services and ambulance
billing programs include charges for
services (primarily ambulance services),
assessments and taxes, and contract

payments from the Miwok Tribe. The
decrease in revenue is primarily due to fund
balance decreasing by $1,313,623.
Decreases to appropriations have been
made to reflect the corresponding decrease
of the use of fund balance. Ambulance
service charges are estimated to rise due to
ambulance fee increases that the Board of
Supervisors approved in 2015, which
helped to offset the decrease in fund
balance.
Pending Issues and Policy
Considerations
Community Hub Program
The Public Health Nursing program, in
partnership with First 5 El Dorado and the
Behavioral Health Division, is proposing to
launch the Community Hub Program
pending the Board of Supervisors and State
funding approvals. The Community Hubs
will leverage the best practices in early
childhood, health and community building to
inform systems change and increase
access to health care, social services and
behavioral health services for families,
including children birth through 18 years of
age. This systems change will offer a local
point of access for services and outreach to
isolated families in the surrounding
communities. Hubs will be established at
libraries located in the five supervisorial
districts within El Dorado County: El Dorado
Hills, Cameron Park, Placerville,
Georgetown, and South Lake Tahoe. The
Hubs will offer health prevention activities
including support groups, educational
classes and engagement opportunities for
the purposes of building resiliency within the
community thereby reducing incidence of
domestic violence, substance use and
improving mental health outcomes.
One full-time Community Health Advocate
will be assigned to each Hub, charged with
engaging isolated families and children from
birth through eighteen years old; assisting
them in health navigation that may include
insurance, medical homes and accessing
social and community services. Using a
trauma informed approach, one full-time
Public Health Nurse at each Hub will
provide case management, assisting clients
in accessing services to meet individualized
needs including referring to contracted
mental health partners. A full-time
Supervising Public Health Nurse will
oversee Hub staff and implementation.
The program is expecting to be funded by
Mental Health Services Act (MHSA)
Innovation funding, a new grant from First 5
and matching federal funding from Maternal
Child Adolescent Health (MCAH). The
program will be tailored to meet funding
awards. The state approvals for the MHSA
and MCAH funding are expected in the fall
of 2016. Lastly, this program is consistent
with the HHSA Strategic Plan as well as the
Healthy Community Goal in the County
strategic plan, by trying to find ways to
increase access of health services to our
community.
The Community Hub Program, once fully
implemented, is projected to use between
$100K and $200K in realignment fund
balance per year.
Public Health Accreditation
Significant progress has been made toward
Public Health Accreditation, which is part of
HHSA’s strategic plan as well as the
County’s Healthy Communities strategic
plan goal. Benefits of accreditation include
identification of strengths and opportunities
for improvement, enhanced validity, and
accountability of public health programs and
services. The accreditation process is
expected to take several years to complete
and will allow Public Health Division
enhanced funding opportunities which could
allow for expansion of services to
underserved populations. Many of the
principals learned through the accreditation
process are already being used to
strengthen other divisions in HHSA.
Public Health Lab
The El Dorado County Public Health Lab is
certified as “high complexity” testing under
guidelines from the Clinical Laboratory
Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA).
As a CLIA laboratory, the lab is capable of
performing testing that involves extensive
manipulation of samples or laboratory
apparatus, and extensive interpretation of
results.
In 1996, Governor Pete Wilson approved
legislation which adopted the federal CLIA
requirements for laboratory personnel. In
summary, personnel assigned to labs such
as El Dorado County must possess a
doctoral degree, must pass a national board
exam, must have a baccalaureate level
public health microbiology certification, and
four years of experience working in a public
health laboratory. For those labs that did
not have a Lab Director who met this
requirement in 1996, including El Dorado
County, the existing Lab Director was
permitted to continue in his/her capacity.
El Dorado County’s current Lab Director
announced his retirement effective April
2017. As a result, HHSA is exploring
options to ensure mandated services are
available, but due to the difficulty in finding
individuals who meet the CLIA
requirements, these options include the
possibility of having to close our lab and
partnering with Sacramento County for lab
services. At this time, the operational and
fiscal impacts are unknown.

The Recommended Budget represents an
overall increase of $102,115 or 5% in
revenues and an increase of $72,516 or 2%
in appropriations when compared to the FY
2015-16 approved budget. As a result, the
Net County Cost has decreased by $29,599
or 2%. This represents a status quo
budget.
Revenues are increasing by $102,115 due
to increased grant funding from First 5 El
Dorado ($26,500), revenue to offset costs
related to high speed Internet services
($67,000) and a donation to the Museum
program from a bequest to the El Dorado
Community Foundation for the purchase of
fireproof filing cabinets ($62,000).
Expenditures remain relatively flat at
$3,784,627. Salaries and benefits are
decreasing by $35,076 due to a reduction in
extra help employee costs; services and
supplies are increasing by $72,516 primarily
due to implementation of new high speed
Internet services at all library branches
($67,000) – offset by the revenue noted
above, and a project in the Museum
program to move the rail at Missouri Flat
Road to the railroad Depot parcel in Shingle
Springs.
Grant funding from First 5 El Dorado is
included in the department’s Recommended
Budget at $263,000. These grant funds are
used to support early literacy programs.
Staffing Changes
The total personnel allocation for the Library
is unchanged at 37.65 FTEs; however, the
Recommended Budget includes the addition
of 1.0 FTE Supervising Librarian for the
Main Library in Placerville and the deletion
of 1.0 Librarian I/II. This allocation change is
recommended to provide dedicated
supervisorial oversight for the branch and
First 5 programs and to allow the Library
Director to focus on long term and short
term planning, management and funding of
countywide library services. There is also a
minor allocation change to delete 0.05 FTE
Custodian and add 0.05 FTE Office
Assistant.

Although the Recommended Budget for the
Library maintains the status quo for branch
operations in FY 2016-17, the budgeted use
of library fund balance is 55% of the total
available fund balance. This use of fund
balance is not sustainable and presents a
significant policy issue for the Board to
consider for future budget years. Unless
long-term funding solutions can be
identified, library hours will be reduced in
future years. The Library Director plans to
schedule a special session with the Board
of Supervisors later this year to discuss
options, possible outcomes and strategies
for the future of library services in the
County.

The Recommended Budget represents an
overall increase of $49,263 or 162% in
revenues and an increase of $72,228 or
15% in appropriations when compared to
the FY 2015-16 approved budget. As a
result, the Net County Cost has increased
by $22,965 or 5%. This represents a status
quo budget.
The increase in revenues is primarily due to
the use of Veteran License Plate special
revenue of approximately $32,400. The
funds are being budgeted for part-time
employee assistance for one-time projects
and to renovate the reception area in the
Placerville office to create another workstation.
The department anticipates an increase in
state subvention revenue of approximately
$18,800. In the past, the initial state budget
did not include increased levels of
subvention funds. However, in the last few
years increased levels of subvention funds
were made available to the County later in
the fiscal year. For FY 2016-17, the State
has included the increased level of
subvention funds in its budget, so the
County has included the revenue.
The increase in appropriations is primarily
related to onetime appropriations. First, the
department has increased part-time funds
due to a grant it received from the El
Dorado County Veteran Affairs Commission
to fund a part-time position for a veteran
trainee and, as stated above, Veteran
License Plate special revenue is being used
to fund a part-time position to digitalize
documents. Second, the department has
budgeted $15,000 for a retiring employee
who is eligible for a payout due to vacation
and sick time that was not used.
The Recorder-Clerk/Registrar of Voters
continues to act as the department head for
Veteran Affairs.
