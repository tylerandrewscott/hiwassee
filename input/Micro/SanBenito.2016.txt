LONG RANGE PLANNING GOALS ( 3-5 YEAR) FOR DEPARTMENT
• Address employment concerns
• Analyzing opportunities for revenue sources
• Continued support to departments to provide tools for efficient service to the community


• Responsiveness and coverage issues due to staffing cuts of more than 42% since 2009-2010.
• Need for an improved document management system, and support staff to manage clerical tasks.
• Need for updated County policies, especially personal policies, which impact the County on a daily basis
and generate significant avoidable work for County Counsel’s Office.

1. Continue to provide timely professional legal advice in the most cost efficient manner possible. The
need for additional County Counsel staffing directly correlates with the staffing and the workload of the
Departments served. As assignments have continued to increase, the need for an additional attorney
has become critical.
2. Improve communications and work processes between the Office of County Counsel and the
Departments it serves. When there is insufficient attorney staffing, time delays occur, critical issues
receive less time and attention than warranted, non-critical issues may be delayed or abandoned, and
there is very little ability to take proactive action on the many issues facing the County.
3. Monitor outside counsel assigned to County litigation to ensure cost containment and delivery of quality
legal services.

Retention of experienced County Auditing staff is the department’s biggest concern. San Benito County’s
proximity to Monterey, Santa Cruz and Santa Clara counties make it difficult to retain experienced staff
without sufficient compensation.
• The completion of the renovation of the Hall of Records Building is a top priority for FY2016-17. Planning
for moving the County Auditor staff to the renovated Hall of Records Building will be addressed during
Fiscal Year 2016-17.
• Retirement of the County’s long-time Property Tax and Special Accounting Analyst will bring on additional
training and other costs.

• The Board of Supervisors has expressed interest in reconsolidated the elective office of the Clerk, Auditor
and Recorder. If the Board moves in this direction, planning the most efficient and effective elective office
consolidated structure will need to begin in FY2016-17.
• One additional Auditor-Accountant I/II/III will need to be added to staff to keep up with demands.

Preparation for the November 8, 2016 Presidential General Election is the Division’s highest priority.
• Retention of highly trained Election staff is the department’s biggest concern especially with the
November 8, 2016 Presidential General Election looming. Fair and accurate elections can only be assured
when election staff are experienced and have been properly trained. San Benito County’s proximity to
Monterey, Santa Cruz and Santa Clara counties make it difficult to retain experienced staff without
sufficient compensation.
• The completion of the renovation of the Hall of Records Building is a top priority for FY2016-17. The odd
calendar year is the window for completion of this project is calendar year 2017.

Replacement of the County’s aging Sequoia voting system must be planned for no later than three years
or perhaps sooner. The system peripherals have been failing at an alarming rate. This expenditure is
expected to cost between $1 and $2 million.

and Recorder. If the Board moves in this direction, planning the most efficient and effective elective office
consolidated structure will need to begin in FY2016-17.

Difficulty in attending meetings and training when staffing is minimal and there are two other County
divisions to tend to.
• At times we may only have one person available to run the operation due to illness, vacations, meetings,
board meetings, training, etc.

• Expand and relocate office for more efficiency.
• Explore using the Logos Treasury module for daily cash flow management or new software for cash
balance to move away from excel spreadsheets to a more sophisticated system.

Retain Staffing Levels - If the SCAPAP Grant is discontinued, it would be prudent to retain staffing levels
to keep the workload from backlogging, but more importantly to retain the knowledge base and not
forgo our investment of time, cost and energy in training of personnel.
• Rapid Development Growth - The office is concerned with the rapid growth in residential developments
and keeping up with new construction assessments. We are working on reducing the backlog of
appraisal work. Our mapping department is trying to stay current on drawing and creating parcels from
new subdivisions.

paper records. The creating of electronic records is a project we have begun and hopefully can
complete in the future.

Continue to Expand Office - If the SCAPAP Grant is extended, the goal would be to expand and grow the
office personnel for future assessment needs.
• Remodel/Renovation of Office - The Hall of Records Building is outdated and in need of renovation
after 53 years of use. The Assessor’s Office space is at full capacity and needs more office space for the
future.
• Lack of IT in the Assessor’s Office - Many of the Assessor’s Office throughout the state have their own
Information Technology person on staff to write data base programs and use access to streamline
workflow process.

without sufficient compensation.
• The completion of the renovation of the Hall of Records Building is a top priority for FY2016-17. Planning

• Develop a County Specific Plan
• Promote staff development

Division staff is most challenged in the areas of local assistance bridge program. Public Works is currently

The Behavioral Health Department is increasingly incurring the effects of being unable to be competitive
in salary and other compensation with other Behavioral Health Care Providers such as neighbor large
counties and large corporate and private level Behavioral Health Care providers. They are consuming the
pool of the skilled, licensed, professionals that the Behavioral Health Department seeks to employ.
• The Behavioral Health Department is in desperate need of a larger building and has a substantial amount
of MHSA funds that state regulations specify must be used for building construction. Those funds are also
subject to reversion back to the state if unspent within a specified time frame.
• The Behavioral Health Department cannot expand service programs or capitalize on other service
expansion opportunities without a larger facility to house additional staff. This situation also puts existing
state allocated funds for service programs in jeopardy of reversion back to the state due to the inability
to expand program growth that requires expansion of staffing for those programs.
LONG RANGE PLANNING GOALS ( 3-5 YEAR) FOR DEPARTMENT
• It is the goal for Behavioral Health’s Mental Health Division to acquire a larger facility and to the
correspondingly expand Mental Health Services Act programs maximizing the utilization of that revenue
stream leveraged in conjunctions with MediCal revenue generation.
• Good progress is being made in coordinating and integrating Behavioral Health Care with physical health
care through a pilot project with the San Benito Health Foundation. It is a long range goal to continue
progress with this concept and to ultimately improve the health and the longevity of life span of
behavioral health clients who currently die on average at significantly young ages as compared to the
general population’s life span.
• It is the Behavioral Health Department’s goal as facility space allows, to expand all behavioral health
treatment services to commensurately meet the needs of the community that will continue to benefit
from the insurance and MediCal beneficiary population growth resulting from the Affordable Care Act.

The Dept. of Health Care Services received approval of a federal waiver to implement a statewide
demonstration project involving the expansion of an expanded Drug MediCal funded service delivery
system. There are new required services and accountability requirements that the County Substance
Abuse Program will be challenged to successfully implement for the new expanded Drug MediCal funded
service delivery system.
• Maintaining Substance Abuse treatment service capacity is a concern as the forensic system evolves in
the acceptance and utilization of treatment in lieu of, or in conjunction with incarceration. The
mandated, non-voluntary treatment utilizing population is expected to increase.
• Currently the Drug MediCal reimbursement rate structure for Substance Abuse Treatment services is very
low compared to MediCal reimbursement rates for mental health services. This is a shared concern by all
Substance Abuse treatment providers throughout our state. As the Behavioral Health Department’s
Substance Abuse Program moves forward with the implementation of the Drug MediCal waiver
expansion services we are concerned that there is fiscal risk in fulfilling the requirements to deliver the
new services and related processes if reimbursement rates may not adequately offset the costs incurred.
LONG RANGE PLANNING GOALS ( 3-5 YEAR) FOR DEPARTMENT
• It is a goal for the Substance Abuse Program to generate increased revenue as the maturation of Drug
MediCal waiver expanded services occurs and to expand the number of service delivery staff
correspondingly with the growth of revenue and the ability to house those staff in a new Behavioral
Health building.
• An excellent and required resource of the Drug MediCal waiver expanded services is medication assisted
substance abuse treatment and residential treatment. There are no viable local options for those
resources at this time and it is a desire that in the future those options exist locally.

Fiduciary: Public Health Services (PHS) has sustained itself on entitlement funds, allocations,
public health realignment monies, and grants that provide for staff services, health education
and community assessment and response. Chronic illness care, public health nurse (PHN) home
visiting, children with special health care needs and care for the aged are areas that will demand
more attention and funding. Projected county population growth will create an increased need
for expansion of public health services requiring more revenues, more services and staff wages
comparable to neighboring counties.
Facilities: PHS conducts business in a building that has had leaks in the roof, outdated and
problematic plumbing, inadequate electrical capacity and overcrowding. The 439 Fourth Street
building needs upgrades and at the very least, telephone, data and electrical line replacements/
renewal or optimally, a complete remodel or relocation. HHSA is exploring a number of options
for improving the facilities for Public Health.
Staff Retention: Higher wages and benefit packages in surrounding counties’ public and private
sectors, rising health insurance costs and growing retirement trends contribute to the low
retention rates of licensed and professional staff, particularly PHNs and Registered
Environmental Health Specialists (REHS). This leads to a loss of staff that acquires costly training
and valuable experience in our county and then leaves for higher pay scales and benefit packages
elsewhere. Recruitment of these professional staff is particularly challenging for the same
reasons, resulting in long-term, ongoing vacancies and an inability to meet the State
requirements of medical oversight and assurance within the local health jurisdiction.
Technology: The computer network system and server providing internet access to PHS is
insufficient. The local area network (LAN) server does not provide an adequate amount of storage
or memory for shared drive purposes. The IT department has been working with PHS to upgrade
systems where possible.

Facilities: Relocate PHS staff and operations to a more suitable building.
Programmatic: Complete contract requirements and achieve goals, objectives and
performance measures for all mandated public health programs.

Immunizations: Increase internal immunization clinics from twice a month and on a walk-in
basis to three times a month to improve childhood immunization rates. This will also increase
PHS’ internal procedures efficiency and utilize staff time more effectively. Work with community
health care providers to improve their facility’s immunization capabilities and rates.
Data Analysis Utilize the California Department of Public Health, California County Profiles
Data, Centers for Disease Control, Community Dashboard, Family Health Outcomes Project,
local hospital and clinics and other viable data sources to set health goals, objectives, strategies
and outcomes. Evaluate internal public health services systems and processes to link public
health initiatives to research and evidence-based practices.
Equipment and technology: Launch the HHSA website and utilize its features to promote
public health, and to communicate with San Benito County population, clients, customers,
providers and the Internet-connected world. Provide ergonomically appropriate equipment
to promote health and safety within the division.
Fiscal: Utilize all available funds to improve the quality of public health services to the public.
Pursue funds to expand services to chronic illness care and children and youth with special
health care needs.
Organizational: Improve public health system operations on all levels. Utilize funds, staffing,
infrastructure and facilities to maximize public health performance.
Partnerships in Wellness: Increase community collaboration among organizations, schools,
businesses and public agencies to maximize existing and potential resources that will improve,
enhance, protect and promote the health of San Benito County families.
Staff Recruitment and Retention: Recruit public health nurses by working with universities,
human resources, staffing and networking programs such as montereybayjobs.com,
monster.com, linkedin and other sources. Strategize with County Administration and HR on
recruitment and compensation options.
Staff Requests: Due to the continuing difficulties in recruiting for a Supervising Public Health
Nurse, we are requesting to set that position aside and add the position of Public Health Services
Manager to lead the licensed and clinical team in 2016/17. This position will provide more
structure to meet the increasing needs of clinical program oversight and guidance to our local
health care providers.
The Department has identified carry over funding in the Supplemental Nutrition Education
program that will allow for additional activities within the program. These activities will require
the addition of a half time (.5FTE) Health Education Associate.
The required job analysis and organizational chart are included in the agency’s personnel
requests package that accompanies this narrative.

Outreach: The Agency has assigned the General Assistance cases to a specific Eligibility Worker in an effort to
provide advocacy for the General Assistance participants. The goal of the Agency is to assist the client in
obtaining employment and/or securing an alternative source of income. The Agency continues to work closely
with the Social Security Administration to assist the clients with the application process. The Eligibility Worker
also assists the clients with transportation to necessary appointments as required by SSA.

and/or another source of income. The Agency will also be exploring the Cal Fresh Employment and Training
Program for this population which would help provide more in depth services and possible funding. Continue
advocacy work with those individuals seeking Social Security Supplemental Income and Disability. The
Department would also like to being refining the County’s GA policy in efforts to establish cost controls.

Current budget being able to sustain a rapidly growing office:
I have concerns and doubts that our previous budget allowance of $11,950 for services and supplies will
sustain our office for the 2016-2017 fiscal year. Currently our office supports 3.3 FTE employees:
1 FTE County Director/Youth Development Advisor
1 FTE Livestock and Range Advisor
.50 FTE 4-H Program Representative
.40 FTE Administrative Assistant
.40 FTE Science Education Coordinator
Presently UC ANR is in the process of identifying Advisor positions for the next three years (2018, 2019 and
2020). In the tri-county region (San Benito, Santa Cruz and Monterey counties) we are proposing three
positions, of which at least one will be located here in San Benito County. As such, our proposed staff will
increase to 5.7 FTE (72.7%) between July, 2016 and December 2020:
1 FTE County Director/Youth Development Advisor
1 FTE Livestock and Range Advisor
1 FTE Tree Fruit and Nut Crop Advisor
.50 FTE Livestock Research Associate
.50 FTE Tree Crop and Fruit Research Associate
.50 FTE 4-H Program Representative
.50 FTE Administrative Assistant
.40 FTE Science Education Coordinator
.30 FTE 2016 Summer youth program Intern
As such, increases in our staffing, calls for a 72.7% increase ($8687.65) in our services and supplies, an
additional vehicle (fixed asset) and an increase in time and funding to our Administrative Assistant contract
(see below) to effectively meet the needs of addressing community issues and solving problems through
research, information and education.
1. Multi-year Administrative Assistant Contract:
To ensure consistent staffing, office hours, support and on-going efficiencies, I would like to ask the County
for a three to five year funding commitment for the Administrative Assistant position contract to UC ANR.
