(18.7%) compared to FY 2015-16.
Capital Assets are recommended at $56,000 for
the purchase of two replacement vehicles. The
Department has requested two full-sized 4x2
Extra Cab ½ ton pick-up trucks.
Residual Equity Transfer-Out is budgeted at
$10,349 for payment of the Department’s share
of the Opterra Energy Efficiency Project. The
Agricultural Commissioner/Farm Advisor
facility on Garden Hwy had solar panels
constructed that will offset Utility costs as well
as Lighting and HVAC upgrades to help reduce
the Departments energy usage.
The Agricultural Commissioner’s
Department was granted use of General
Government Impact Fee (0-101) funds in
prior years to help offset the cost of a facility
expansion project, with the understanding
that 40% of the funds would be reimbursed to
the Fund using any unanticipated Unclaimed
Gas Tax revenue. Excess Unclaimed Gas
Tax revenue is to be used first to make
progress toward repayment, prior to being
used for extra projects or purchases. It is
anticipated to make the final payment of
$62,115 to the General Government Impact
Fee fund in FY 2015-16 due to projected
savings.
This budget is recommended at $174,000, of
which $168,000 is for a replacement Weight

portion of the Maintenance and Replacement
costs, is budgeted as an Interfund expense in
the Agricultural Commissioner’s budget unit
(2-601). The rest of the funding is provided
by revenues collected from Yuba and Nevada
Counties.
Due to current California Air Resources
Board requirements, the County is required to
replace this vehicle by the year 2020. Over
the past three years, the Administrative
Committee has been developing a plan for the
replacement of this vehicle. The Committee
is recommending increasing contributions
into these accounts in order to purchase this
replacement vehicle this fiscal year. The
estimated cost of the replacement is
$168,000, which includes purchase of the
vehicle, fabrication, installation of a new bed
(due to safety concerns), and transferring of
existing articulating crane. Other factors
driving the decision to replace the vehicle in
FY 2016-17 are: (1) 5% annual appreciation
in the cost of a new vehicle, (2) safety
concerns with existing truck bed and load
securement, and (3) increasing on-going
maintenance costs with the existing vehicle.
An update to the JPA will need to be
developed and approved by the member
jurisdictions and will be presented to the
Board for consideration at a later date.

as Lighting upgrades to help reduce energy
usage. In addition, all three Library
locations had HVAC upgrades to help
reduce the Departments energy usage.
Over the years, staff has manually entered
positions into the budget system. With the
upgrade to ONESolution a reconciliation of
the position allocation schedules has been
done. For this budget unit, it was discovered
that one unfunded position had been
removed from the budget allocation table,
while it has no net effect on budget it is
important to have an accurate reflection of

new classification recommended in
FY 2015-16 in an effort to reflect the broad
range of administrative duties that are
required of positions in the Development
Services Department. It is the intent that the
new classification will assist the Department
in providing adequate customer service and
administrative support coverage.

will come from County Criminal Justice
Development Impact Fee Fund (0-102) and
the remaining estimated $2.1 million will be
covered by County General Funds. As the
project evolves and construction starts the
project costs are subject to vary. Future
revenue received in Fund 0-102, beyond the
current $1.5 million fund balance, may also
be used to offset General Fund costs.
Because reimbursement cannot be claimed
until the construction contract is awarded,
this budget reflects the transfer-in of funds
from the County’s Criminal Justice
Development Impact Fee Fund (0-102) to
cover any required local match and to
advance funds to complete the initial phases
of the proje

system (01) and $158,235 for the Wastewater
Service (02). The budget reflects the total
expenditures associated with Operations &
Maintenance, Structure Improvements/
Capital Expenses, and Depreciation Expense.
The majority of the District’s expenses are
associated with maintenance and operations.
This category includes supplies and
materials, electricity, chemicals, professional
services, monitoring, state permits, repair and
maintenance expenses, staff expenses for the
operator and engineering support staff, and
other costs associated with operating the
water system. There are also administrative
costs incurred by the District, such as costs
associated with performing utility billing
services and accounting for the District.
The District is under a Compliance Order for
arsenic exceedance in the water service
program. In order to comply with the order,
the District needs to update the
water treatment plant. The FY 2012-13,
FY 2013-14, and FY 2014-15 budgets that
were approved by the District’s Board of
Directors included expenses associated with
an arsenic remediation feasibility study
associated with the design of a new water
treatment plant incorporating arsenic
removal technologies. The Consultant
Agreement, which includes design recommendations, concluded September
2015.
In November 2013, a new monthly water fee
of $70.00 per EDU for water service was
adopted by the District’s Board of Directors.
The new water fee went into effect on
January 1, 2014. In March 2016, a new
wastewater fee of $103.50 per Equivalent
Dwelling Unit (EDU) was adopted by the
District Board of Directors to cover the actual
ongoing operations and maintenance costs
associated with operating the wastewater
services for the District. The new wastewater
fee went into effect on May 1, 2016.
Approved services rates do not generate
enough operating revenue to cover the noncash
Depreciation Expense of $126,069 for
the wastewater system, or the Depreciation
Expense of $34,452 for the water system.
Historically, the replacement costs for
infrastructure have been provided by State
grants.

for one Chief Appraiser position. To help
offset the long-term costs of this addition, it
is recommended that one vacant Assessment
Office Supervisor position be eliminated and
one vacant Assessment Technician I be
eliminated. It is recommended that these
changes be effective July 1, 2016.
Two promotions within flexibly-staffed
positions are recommended - Assessment
Technician I to Assessment Technician II and
Assessment Technician II to Assessment
Technician II both effective July 1, 2016.
Over the years, staff has manually entered
positions into the budget system. With the
upgrade to ONESolution a reconciliation of the
position allocation schedules has been
done. For this budget unit, it was discovered
that two unfunded eliminated position had not
been removed from the budget allocation table,
while it has no net effect on budget it is
important to have an accurate reflection of all
positions.

usage. In addition, the building will also
benefit from the Acacia property Solar Panel
array that will offset Utility costs. This
payment reflects the Assessor’s proportional
share of the building’s total payment.
There was a significant increase in the
Department’s unreimbursed cost during
FY 2014-15, primarily due to the reduction in
the Interfund Transfer-In from the State-
County Property Tax Program special
revenue fund (0-181). This was first
budgeted in FY 2010-11 to offset staff costs,
in an effort to avoid further budget reductions
in the Assessor’s budget unit. With the
FY 2014-15 budget, it was recommended that
the Interfund Transfer-In be reduced to
$16,000. During FY 2015-16 this amount
was again reduced to $10,500. The funds in
this special revenue fund reflect the
remaining balance of funds received under
the State’s former State-County Property Tax
Administration Grant Program, which was
eliminated by the State Legislature
effectively in FY 2006-07. This funding
source previously provided additional
revenue to augment staffing and for
acquisition of new equipment and
technology, necessary to enhance staff
proficiency and productivity and to eliminate
backlogs. As indicated above, these funds
have been used recently to offset regular
staffing costs in the Assessor’s office, but
those funds are now virtually depleted. It is
anticipated that the remaining balance in the
fund will be approximately $21,100 at July 1,
2016.
This budget is recommended at $1,590,729.
The General Fund provides 96.1% of the
financing for this budget unit and is
decreased by $98,523 (6.1%) compared to
FY 2015-16. A portion of the costs for this
budget unit, estimated by the Auditor-
Controller at $716,738, are recouped through
the annual A-87 cost plan.
It is recommended that the Limited Term
Account Clerk I position, authorized for
FY 2015-16, be authorized through
September 2016. This will allow time for the
Auditor-Controller to fill the Senior Internal
Auditor position, approved by the Board of
Supervisors in April 2016, and ensure
internal operations are adequately staffed
until all permanent positions are filled.
Extra Help funding continues to include
$10,000 to fund approximately 620 hours of
an Account Clerk I position to perform data
entry duties which had been previously
performed by the Computer Operator in the
Information Technology Department. This
change was first implemented in FY 2011-12.
The Plant Acquisition/Facilities Project
Request for FY 2016-17 is not included in the
Recommended Budget as an overall plan for
the updating of the facility at 463 Second
Street needs to be developed. The Auditor-
Controller’s Office will be included in those
plans.
This budget is recommended at $369,731,
which is an increase of $39,429 (11.9%)
compared to FY 2015-16. The General Fund
provides 100% of the funding for this budget
unit.
This budget is recommended at $179,106,
which is an increase of $19,696 (12.4%) over
to FY 2015-16. The General Fund provides
58.7% of the financing for the Clerk-
Recorder’s Department and is increased in
the Clerk of the Board budget unit by $18,746
(11.8%) compared to FY 2015-16.
This budget is recommended at $867,261,
which is an increase of $56,421 (7.0%) over
FY 2015-16. The General Fund provides
58.7% of the financing for the Clerk-
Recorder’s Department and is increased in
the Elections budget unit by $47,321 (6.4%)
compared to FY 2015-16.
Previous budgets have included funding for
smaller, less frequent landowner and utility
district elections (UDEL). This budget does
not include funding for these elections. In the
event such an election is called, a budget
amendment requiring Board action would be
required and the County would be
reimbursed by the entity requesting the
election.
This budget is recommended at $607,470,
which is an increase of $46,904 (8.4%) over
FY 2015-16. The General Fund provides
58.7% of the financing for the Clerk-
Recorder’s Department and is increased in
the Recorder budget unit by $16,164 (50.0%)
compared to FY 2015-16.
The recommended budget includes the
addition of one Office Assistant I position to
be split between the County Recorder budget
unit (0.6 FTE) and the County Clerk budget
unit (0.4 FTE). This position is partially
funded with a decrease in Extra Help costs
and an increase in Passports revenue and
Other Charges Current Services revenue in
the County Clerk budget unit. It is
recommended the position be authorized to
be filled as of July 1, 2016.
The recommended budget maintains one
frozen and unfunded Deputy Clerk-Recorder
position, which was defunded in FY 2011-12.
This budget is recommended at $287,298,
which is an increase of $33,429 (13.2%)
compared to FY 2015-16. The General Fund
provides 58.7% of the financing for the
Clerk-Recorder’s Department and is
increased in the County Clerk budget unit by
$8,379 (7.1%) compared to FY 2015-16.
The recommended budget includes the
addition of one Office Assistant I position to
be split between the County Recorder budget
unit (0.6 FTE) and the County Clerk budget
unit (0.4 FTE). This position is partially
funded with a decrease in Extra Help costs
and an increase in Passports revenue and
Other Charges Current Services revenue in
the County Clerk budget unit. It is
recommended the position be authorized to
be filled as of July 1, 2016.
This budget is recommended at $25,000. The
General Fund does not provide any financing
for this budget unit.
This budget is recommended at $1,049,131.
The General Fund provides 100% of the
financing for this budget unit, and is
decreased by $50,103 (4.6%) compared to
FY 2015-16. A portion of the costs for this
budget unit are recouped through the annual
A-87 Cost Plan.
Residual Equity Transfer-Out is budgeted at
$5,467 for payment of the Department’s share
of the Opterra Energy Efficiency Project. The
Administration Building at 1160 Civic Center
Blvd had Lighting and HVAC upgrades to help
reduce the building’s energy usage. In addition,
the building will also benefit from the Acacia
property Solar Panel array that will offset
Utility costs. This payment reflects the County
Administrator’s Office proportional share of the
building’s total payment.
The County Administrative Office assumed
oversight responsibility for the Human
Resources and Emergency Services functions
of the County in FY 2014-15. Due to
continued budget constraints and other needs
within the County, it is recommended that no
position be added back to this budget unit in
this fiscal year. Therefore, it is recommended
that the Human Resources function of the
County remain assigned to the County
Administrative Office for FY 2016-17 with
no additional staff within the Human
Resources Department to augment the related
functions.
The County Administrative Office will also
continue to oversee the Emergency Services
budget unit in FY 2016-17, including
oversight of the inter-related functions of
Risk Management and Loss Prevention
Services. The Recommended Budget and
Organization Chart reflect these assignments.
The budget continues to maintain the Senior
Analyst position as vacant and unfunded.
This position was first left vacant and
unfunded in FY 2010-11.
This budget is recommended at $1,844,561.
The General Fund provides approximately
97.8% of the financing for this budget unit and
increased $1,257,033 (229.5%) over
FY 2015-16.
Audit Fees are recommended at $85,000 for
annual Independent Audit costs. This will be
the third year of a three-year contract.
The Professional and Specialized Services
account is recommended at $145,000, and
includes $10,000 for the Management
Training program along with other general
contract services currently in place or which
may be required during the year.
The Contribution to Other Agencies account
continues to reflect the County’s contribution
to the Area 4 Agency on Aging (pursuant to a
current Joint Powers Agreement).
The Contribution to Other Agencies account
also reflects the $52,000 annual contribution
to the Yuba Sutter Economic Development
Corporation, which was moved to the NDE
budget unit from the Subsidy Request budget
unit (7-202) in FY 2013-14.
The Contribution to Other Agencies account
reflects $1,000,000 anticipated to be invested
with Public Agency Retirement Services
(PARS). PARS enables the County to
establish a Pension Benefits Trust Fund and
an Other Post-Employment Benefits (OPEB)
Trust Fund in order to pre-fund a portion of
unfunded pension and OPEB actuarial
liabilities. Investment in PARS as a Section
115 Trust is enabled by Government Code
53216.1.
Interfund transfers include $310,000 to reflect
Sutter County’s proportional share of the Tri-
County Reginal Juvenile Rehabilitation
Facility Construction Project. This amount is
budgeted to be transferred to the Juvenile Hall
(2-309) budget unit for payment to Yuba
County.
Intrafund Transfers include a negative $5,000
(essentially a revenue) in Intrafund
Rents/Leases related to the Farm Advisor’s
building lease. This account is budgeted each
year.
For FY 2016-17, there is one recommended
position elimination resulting in a layoff.
This position is not in the General Fund;
therefore, there are no recommended costs in
this budget unit.
The estimate for the General Revenue
category (including Intrafund revenue) is
$38,100,941, which is an increase of
$1,565,475 (4.3%) compared to the
FY 2015-16 Adopted Budget.
The increase is primarily due to two increases
in two primary sources of General Fund
revenue: (1) an increase in secured property
tax; and (2) an increase in property tax in-lieu
of vehicle license fee revenues.
The County's three major General Revenues
have traditionally been the property tax, the
sales tax, and the motor vehicle in-lieu
payments from the State. However,
significant changes occurred in FY 2004-05
regarding how two of these major revenue
streams, the sales tax and the motor vehicle
in-lieu (MVIL) payments, are received from
the State.
The voter approved Proposition 57 (The
Economic Recovery Bond Act, 2004),
implemented a set of transactions, also
known as the “Triple Flip,” whereby a share
of revenues that had previously appeared
under the Sales and Use Taxes account are
now shown in the related In-Lieu Local Sales
and Use Tax account. The amount that each
county receives for In-Lieu Local Sales and
Use Tax is provided each year by the State
Controller’s Office. This “temporary” shift
of revenues by the State was to last until all
revenue bonds issued by the State, pursuant
to Proposition 57, were paid off. As planned,
the Triple Flip ended in FY 2015-16 with the
final payment expected in June 2016. The
Bradley-Burns local tax rate was returned to
the full 1 percent on January 1, 2016.
For FY 2016-17, the In-Lieu Local Sales and
Use Tax account has been budgeted at $0,
while the Sales and Use Taxes account has
been increased by $837,324. These changes
have been implemented due to the end of the
Triple Flip and the return of the full 1%
Bradley-Burns local tax rate.
Prior to 2004, a primary source of revenue for
California counties was the motor vehicle inlieu.
Due to the voter approved Proposition
1A (Protection of Local Government
Revenues Act of November 2004), the State
now receives the motor vehicle in-lieu
revenues and have “swapped” that revenue
for property tax. That revenue is budgeted in
the Property Tax In-Lieu – Vehicle License
Fee account. The intent of Prop 1A was to
protect revenues collected by local
governments (cities, counties, and special
districts) from being transferred to the
California state government for statewide
use. This was a permanent change to the
County-State relationship regarding these
revenues, and the County will continue to
receive Property Tax revenues in lieu of MVIL. Property Tax In-Lieu - Vehicle
License Fee revenues are calculated each
year by a formula determined by the State
Controller’s Office. It should be noted that
these In-Lieu Property Tax revenues are not
related to, nor should they in any way impact,
the amount received in the Property Tax –
Secured account.
For FY 2015-16, property tax revenues
(including secured, unsecured, and property
tax in lieu of Motor Vehicle License Fees) are
projected to be approximately $24.4 million.
This represents a combined increase of
$1,748,000, or 7.7%, from the FY 2015-16
Adopted Budget. Estimates for property tax
and related revenues have been developed
based on an evaluation of estimates and
projections received from the Auditor-
Controller’s Office and developed jointly by
the County Administrative Office and the
Auditor-Controller’s Office. While it
appears that revenues are increasing,
estimates for improvements in property tax
revenues remain comparatively conservative.
The County Administrative Officer and the
Assessor estimate that secured property tax
revenue will increase by 1.1% over
FY 2015-16 actual receipts based on recent
market activity. These estimates represent an
increase of 6.9% over two years based upon
FY 2014-15 actual receipts.
The Auditor-Controller’s Office has
provided the County Administrative Office
with estimates indicating that current
supplemental property tax revenue, current
unsecured property tax revenue, and other
related revenues will increase for
FY 2015-16. As mentioned previously, these
estimates were developed jointly and agreed
upon by the Auditor-Controller’s Office and
County Administrator’s Office. The
recommended revenue amounts, based on
recent and historic activity, are slightly less
conservative in nature compared to the
County’s past budgeting approach.
The budget for sales and use tax revenue,
including in-lieu revenue, is recommended at
approximately $3.3 million. Sales tax based
revenues declined substantially in
FY 2008-09 and FY 2009-10; however, the
decline in sales tax revenues appears to have
leveled off starting with FY 2011-12. Sales
and Use Tax has remained flat from
FY 2013-14 through FY 2014-15. Due to the
ending of the Triple Flip, it is difficult to
project Sales and Use Tax for FY 2016-17.
However, the current estimate of $3.3 million
represents a 4.3% increase compared to the
FY 2015-16 Adopted Budget. Sutter County
has averaged an increase of 5.5% for sales
and use taxes over the past three completed
fiscal years (FY 2011-12 through
FY 2014-15).
The County receives Franchise Fee revenue
from three sources: PG&E, Recology Yuba-
Sutter, and Comcast, with the majority of the
fee revenue coming from PG&E. Because
the PG&E franchise fee is tied to electric and
gas use, this revenue source fluctuates from
year to year. However, overall, Franchise
Fee revenue from PG&E has gradually
declined over the past three years. Total
franchise fee revenue is budgeted at $1.25
million, a decrease of $50,000 (3.8%)
compared to FY 2015-16.
Revenue from Interest earned on monies held
by the General Fund in the pooled treasury
has decreased substantially over the past five
years. This decrease is primarily due to the
combination of a decrease in the general fund
balances held in the pooled treasury and a
general decrease in the overall pooled
treasury interest rate. However, projections
for FY 2015-16 show a slight increase in this revenue and therefore, the FY 2016-17
estimate for Interest revenue is increased by
$15,000 to $265,000.
The estimated available Fund Balance from
FY 2015-16 is $4.65 million. This represents
carry-forward monies generated from ongoing
County operations which can be, and
need to be, used to fund on-going County
expenditures. This represents an increase of
approximately $1.65 million from the
amount that was budgeted to be available in
the FY 2015-16 Recommended Budget.
It should be noted that the actual estimated
available Fund Balance will not be known
until the financial books of the County are
closed by the Auditor-Controller and it is
likely that the actual fund balance will differ
from what is included in this
recommendation. At this time, it is
anticipated that any change in Fund Balance
available that results from the closing of the
County books at year-end will be adjusted to
increase Unassigned Fund Balance in the
General Fund. If significantly less revenue is
received than anticipated, staff will return to
the Board of Supervisors with revised
recommendations.
The recommended Appropriation for
Contingency is $864,112 and is increased by
$334,181 (63.1%) when compared to
FY 2015-16.
This budget is recommended at $393,896,
which is an increase of $129,523 (49.0%)
over FY 2015-16. This budget unit is within
the Public Safety fund; however, it is
considered to be funded primarily by the
General Fund, which provides 28.3% of the
financing for this budget unit. This is an
increase of $39,828 (55.7%) compared to
FY 2015-16. The increase is primarily
related to the retirement and subsequent
deletion of the Emergency Operations
Manager position and the hiring of the
Emergency Operations and Loss Prevention
Manager position.
For FY 2015-16, the division is staffed by an
Emergency Operations and Loss Prevention
Manager Position allocated at 0.7 FTE in this
budget unit and 0.3 FTE in the Liability
Insurance ISF budget unit (4-590). The
Public Information Officer Position
allocation is recommended to remain at 0.2
FTE in this budget unit.
The remaining thirty percent (0.3 FTE) of the
Emergency Operations and Loss Prevention
Manager’s 1.0 FTE allocation for
FY 2016-17 will be dedicated to managing
identified countywide safety efforts, which
overlap with countywide emergency
management and communication duties. The
County is eligible for reimbursement for
these duties, and any revenue received will be
deposited into the Refund account within the
Liability Insurance ISF budget unit.
This budget is recommended at $682,879,
which is a decrease of $100,850 (12.9%)
compared to FY 2015-16. The General Fund
provides 96.3% of the financing for this
budget unit and is decreased by $101,661
(13.4%) compared to FY 2015-16. A portion
of the costs for this budget unit are recouped
from outside and subvented funds through
the annual (A-87) Cost Plan.
This recommended budget reflects the
continued elimination of the Human
Resources Director position. The Human
Resources function of the County was
reassigned to the County Administrative
Office for FY 2014-15. It had been
anticipated that a lower-level Human
Resources manager position would be added
back to the budget once County revenues
increased sufficiently. However, due to
continued budget constraints and other needs
within the County, it is recommended that no
position be added back to this budget unit in
this fiscal year. The Director position had
historically been included in both the Human
Resources (1-401) budget unit (80%) and the
Workers’ Compensation (4-591) budget unit
(20%). There is no recommendation to
allocate County Administrative staff to the
Human Resources budget unit. However,
10% of the County Administrative Officer
position has been included in the Workers’
Compensation budget unit. The
organizational structure of the department
will continue to be evaluated during
FY 2016-17.
It is recommended that the Extra Help budget
remain defunded for FY 2016-17. The
Department has been closed to the public
during the noon hour (from 12:30 p.m. to
1:30 p.m.) due to the loss of extra-help front
desk assistance in FY 2012-13.
The Department is reducing its Professional
and Specialized Services expenses by
$21,000. This amount reflects a decrease in
flexible spending account administration fees
(this cost is included in insurance premiums
with SJVIA) and a decrease in investigation
fees as departments for whom the
investigations are being conducted are
funding the cost of outside investigators as
needed.
Contract negotiations will take place with all
bargaining units in FY 2016-17 and the
department will request additional funding if
necessary once a negotiator and cost has been
determined. Residual Equity Transfer-Out is budgeted at
$3,395 for payment of the Department’s
share of the Opterra Energy Efficiency
Project. The Administration Building at 1160
Civic Center Blvd had Lighting and HVAC
upgrades to help reduce the building’s energy
usage. In addition, the building will also
benefit from the Acacia property Solar Panel
array that will offset Utility costs. This
payment reflects the Human Resource’s
proportional share of the building’s total
payment. 
This budget is recommended at $79,673
(when Intrafund revenue is included). This
results in an increase of $2,278 (2.9%) over
FY 2015-16.
There are no other changes recommended in
this budget unit. Because this budget unit
reflects only the cost of insurance premiums
which are provided to the County by the
carrier, there is no practical ability for the
County to affect budget reductions in this
budget unit in the short-term.
This budget is recommended at $561,225.
The FY 2016-17 General Fund cost for this
budget unit is $353,769, or 63.0% of the total
budget. The General Fund’s cost for this
budget unit has increased by $38,156
(12.1%) as compared to FY 2015-16.
It was recommended to add one Animal
Control Officer I position in the Yuba City
budget along with other general increases.
Yuba City provides Workers’ Compensation
benefits for all employees including the
employees contracted from Sutter County.
However, because Workers’ Compensation costs are allocated to all Sutter County
departments utilizing a formula that includes
a 10-year experience factor, there is a residual
cost for the coverage provided in prior years
by Sutter County while it acted as lead
agency. This residual cost ($156,723 for FY
2016-17) will be borne by Sutter County
alone and is reflected in this recommended
budget. This residual amount will eventually
decrease and be reduced to zero.
This budget consists of the following primary
expenses and related revenues.
 Contribution to Other Agencies,
recommended at $237,031, reflecting
Sutter County’s 22% share of the SASA
operating budget. Sutter County’s share
of cost for FY 2015-16 is based on
population, and has been reduced from
25% in prior years.
 The residual Intrafund Overhead (A-87)
charge of $44,771, not shared by the
SASA jurisdictions, reflects an
adjustment to credit costs paid by Sutter
County in the prior year. This item was
removed from the shared SASA budget in
FY 2011-12 and will eventually be
reduced to zero.
 The Yuba City Animal Control revenue
line item, $207,456, which reflects the
actual cost of employees contracted to
Yuba City.
Eventually, the General Fund cost for this
budget unit will reduce each year to reflect
the reduction of residual costs and any
changes that may occur to the agreement for
employee services with the City of Yuba
City. At some time in the future, this budget
unit will reflect only Sutter County’s
proportionate share of the approved SASA
operating budget.
This budget is recommended at $769,413.
The County’s Liability self-insurance was
transitioned to Trindel during FY 2014-15.
The Liability Insurance budget unit operates
as an ISF and must balance revenues to
expenditures within the fund.
The recommended budget increases result in
a $46,281 (6.4%) increase in the Interfund
Liability Insurance ISF premium charges to
County Departments as compared to
FY 2015-16. The amount budgeted in the
Interfund Liability Insurance ISF line item
reflects the total charges made to County
departments for liability insurance premiums,
management of the liability fund, and loss
prevention efforts. Therefore, the increase in
this account equals the amount that has been
increased in County department budgets for
FY 2016-17.
This budget is recommended at $2,678,216,
which is an increase of $37,523 (1.4%) over
FY 2015-16.
It is continued to be recommended that 20%
of the Risk Manager position be allocated to
the Workers’ Compensation budget unit
(4-591) to reflect management of that fund
and the oversight of the County’s loss
prevention efforts. These staffing costs were
previously recorded through an Interfund
transfer (Interfund Administration – Misc.
Departments).
Because the net costs of this fund are
allocated to all County departments,
including General Fund departments, a
significant effort has been made to contain
costs in the Workers’ Compensation Fund.
Over 80% of the cost of the County’s
Workers’ Compensation program is driven
by insurance premium costs. Initial
insurance premium estimates received from
the carrier indicate an increase over the prior
year budgeted amount, driven primarily by
escalating workers’ compensation insurance
rates from the underwriting markets.
This budget is recommended at $738,312,
which is an increase of $45,779 (6.6%)
compared to FY 2015-16.
Because the net costs of this fund are
allocated to all County departments,
including General Fund departments, a
significant effort has been made to contain
costs in the Employee Wellness Services
Fund.
The recommended General Fund
Contribution is $4,074,579, which is an
increase of $187,907 (4.8%) compared to
FY 2015-16. As noted, this Unreimbursed
Cost represents the County share of all
recommended budgets in the Trial Court
Fund (0-014).
The recommended General Fund
contribution is $4,074,579, which is an
increase of $187,907 (4.8%) compared to
FY 2015-16.
The recommended amount equals the
revenue that is required to meet the
Unreimbursed Costs of all the budget units
within the Trial Court Fund (0-014), which
include Sheriff’s Court Bailiffs (2-103),
Public Defender (2-106), Trial Court
Funding (2-109), Superior Court (2-112) and
Probation (2-304).
The Revenue for this budget is recommended
at $24,814,532, which is an increase of
$2,458,486 (9.6%) compared to FY 2015-16.
The recommended General Fund
contribution is $17,414,532, which is an
increase of $2,458,486 (16.4%) compared to
FY 2015-16.
California voters enacted Proposition 172 in
1993, which established a permanent
statewide half-cent sales tax for support of
local public safety functions. Proposition
172 funding is budgeted at $7.4 million for
FY 2016-17. The full amount received is to
be transferred from the Public Safety
Augmentation Fund (0-282) to the Public
Safety Fund (0-015) in FY 2016-17. It should be noted that the decrease of
$288,347 in Prop 172 revenue accounts for a
one-time deposit of additional Prop 172
revenue that occurred in FY 2015-16.
Otherwise, the FY 2015-16 Prop 172
budgeted amount would have been $7.1
million, while the FY 2016-17 amount is $7.4
million.
In FY 2016-17, the General Fund is budgeted
to contribute approximately $17.4 million in
funding to the Public Safety fund in excess of
the Proposition 172 funding. The General
Fund contribution to the Public Safety fund is
recommended to increase by $2,458,486.
This budget is recommended at $17,414,532,
which is an increase of $1,870,139 (12.0%)
compared to FY 2015-16. The General Fund
contribution to the Public Safety Fund
reflects the total of the recommended
Unreimbursed Costs of all budgets within the
Public Safety Fund.
This budget is recommended at $6,261,186
which is an increase of $234,826 (3.9%) over
FY 2015-16.
The County’s contribution to the Health Fund
is recommended at $2,371,354. This
contribution includes $674,240 to satisfy the
County’s AB8 required match (which is
interpreted to remain intact following the
passage of AB85); and $188,781 for the
County’s required CMSP Participation Fee, which pursuant to Welfare and Institutions
Code Section 16809.3(d) may not be paid
with Health Realignment funds and pursuant
to Welfare and Institutions Code Section
16990(e) may not be included in determining
compliance with any other statutory
Maintenance of Effort provisions. After these
deductions, the net General Fund
contribution to the Health Fund equals
$1,508,333.
MVIL Realignment revenues are
recommended at $3,782,869, which is an
increase of $638,493 (20.3%) compared to
FY 2015-16. In March of 2014, AB85 came
into effect, which redirected how sales tax
and MVIL will be distributed, as well as
ceased the pass-through of CMSP funds.
MVIL Realignment revenues will continue to
be monitored to see how that revenue stream
may affect this budget unit throughout the
coming fiscal year.
The Realignment revenue amounts are set
each year by the State Controller’s Office. It
should be noted that these budgeted figures
are subject to change once revenue estimate
information becomes available from the State
Controller’s Office later in the year.

This budget is recommended at $6,154,223.
The County’s General Fund contribution to
the Health Fund is recommended at
$2,371,354 a decrease of $508,221 (17.6%)
compared to FY 2015-16. This contribution
includes $674,240 to satisfy the County’s
AB8 required match (which is interpreted to
remain intact following the passage of
AB85); and $188,781 for the County’s
required CMSP Participation Fee, which
pursuant to Welfare and Institutions Code
Section 16809.3(d) may not be paid with
Health Realignment funds and pursuant to
Welfare and Institutions Code Section 16990(e) may not be included in determining
compliance with any other statutory
Maintenance of Effort provisions. After
these deductions, the net General Fund
contribution to the Health Fund equals
$1,508,333.
MVIL Realignment revenues are
recommended at $3,782,869, which is an
increase of $638,493 (20.3%) compared to
FY 2015-16. In March of 2014, AB85 came
into effect, which redirected how sales tax
and MVIL will be distributed, as well as
ceased the pass-through of CMSP funds.
MVIL Realignment revenues will continue to
be monitored to see how that revenue stream
may affect this budget unit throughout the
coming fiscal year.
A policy direction which is recommended for
implementation during FY 2016-17, in
preparation for the production of the
FY 2017-18 Recommended Budget, is to
change the method for transferring the
County’s AB8 Match contribution and the
County required CMSP Participation Fee.
It is recommended that a process be
developed, in conjunction with the Auditor-
Controller’s Office and the Health
Department, to transfer these General Fund
contributions first through the Health
Realignment Trust Special Revenue Fund
(0-247) and then to the Health Fund (i.e., to
the Health Care – General budget unit
4-110). These amounts are currently
transferred from the General Fund directly to
the Health Fund. The incumbent Human
Services Director concurred with this
recommendation.
In March 2014 AB85 came into effect, which
redirected how sales tax and MVIL portions
of the Social Services Realignment Revenues
(SSRR) would be distributed. Revenues will
continue to be monitored to see how they may
affect this budget unit throughout the coming
fiscal year.
The recommended revenue is $5,009,072,
which is an increase of $170,347 (3.5%)
compared to FY 2015-16.
The recommended amount for the sales tax
portion of the SSRR, which, by statute, is first deposited to the Welfare and Social Services
Realignment Fund, is recommended at
$4,344,072. This is an increase of
$2,991,437 over FY 2015-16 and is
attributable to the increase in unreimbursed
cost of the budget units within the Welfare
and Social Services fund as well as AB85.
The recommended budget for the MVIL
portion of the SSRR is $216,000, which is a
decrease of $2,821,090 compared to
FY 2015-16 and is attributable to AB85. The
Motor Vehicle In-lieu (MVIL) portion of the
SSRR is first deposited in the General Fund
and is then transferred to this budget unit.
The SSRR amounts are set each year by the
State Controller’s Office. It should be noted
these budgeted figures are subject to change
once revenue estimate information becomes
available from the State Controller’s office
later in the year.
The recommended budget is $665,000 which
is a decrease of $2,821,090 (80.9%) over
FY 2015-16. The Unreimbursed Cost of this
budget unit represents the County share of all
recommended budgets in the Welfare/Social
Services Fund.
In March 2014 AB-85 came into effect,
which redirected how sales tax and MVIL
portions of the Social Services Realignment
Revenues (SSRR) would be distributed.
Revenues will continue to be monitored to
see how they may affect this budget unit
throughout the coming fiscal year
This budget is recommended at $1,224,967
which is a decrease of $9,065 (0.7%)
compared to FY 2015-16. The General Fund
provides 97.4% of the financing for this
budget unit. A portion of the costs for this
budget unit are recouped from outside and
subvented funds through the annual (A-87)
Cost Plan.
Residual Equity Transfer-Out is budgeted at
$5,032 for payment of the Department’s
share of the Opterra Energy Efficiency
Project. The Administration Building at 1160
Civic Center Blvd had Lighting and HVAC
upgrades to help reduce the building’s energy
usage. In addition, the building will also
benefit from the Acacia property Solar Panel
array that will offset Utility costs. This
payment reflects County Counsel’s
proportional share of the building’s total
payment.
This budget is recommended at $1,012,331
which is an increase of $6,188 (0.6%) over
FY 2015-16. The General Fund provides
63.1% of the financing for the Office, which
is an increase of $8,788 (1.4%) compared to
FY 2015-16. The Plant Acquisition/Facilities Project
Request for FY 2016-17 is not included in the
Recommended Budget as an overall plan for
the updating of the facility at 463 Second
Street needs to be developed. The Treasurer-
Tax Collector’s Office will be included in
those plans.
This budget is recommended at $228,257
which is an increase of $22,760 (11.1%) over
FY 2015-16. The General Fund provides
81.8% of the financing for this budget which
is an increase of $39,760 (27.0%) compared
to FY 2015-16. In prior years, special
revenue funds were used to offset General
Fund costs in this budget unit. No special
revenue funds are recommended for use in
FY 2016-17 due to lack of funds available.
This recommendation reflects the continued
decision to hold vacant and unfunded one
Treasurer-Deputy Collector position that was
initially frozen and unfunded in FY 2009-10.
This budget is recommended at $850,109,
which is a decrease of $38,439 (4.3%)
compared to FY 2015-16. The General Fund
provides 28% of the financing for this budget
unit and is increased by $5,377 (2.3%) when
compared to FY 2015-16.
Budget Changes
This budget unit historically provided mail
services for the Sutter County Superior Court
and billed for the cost of postage. The
Courthouse has moved to a new location and
has opted to provide its own mail services.
This is reflected in the budget as a decrease in postage and a decrease in Court
Reimbursement revenue.
The Auditor-Controller has determined the
County’s copier lease is a capital lease as
opposed to an operational lease. This is
reflected by a decrease in Rents and Leases
Equipment and an increase in Residual
Equity Transfer Out.
This budget is recommended at $301,654
which is an increase of $35,379 (13.3%) over
FY 2015-16. The General Fund provides
86.7% of the financing for this budget unit
and is increased by $23,879 (10.0%)
compared to FY 2015-16.
This budget is recommended at $3,211,497,
which is a decrease of $271,704 (7.8%)
compared to FY 2015-16. The General Fund
provides 82% of the financing for this budget
unit and is decreased by $365,280 (12.2%)
compared to FY 2015-16.
A portion of the costs for this budget unit are
recouped from outside and sub-vented funds
through the annual (A-87) Cost Plan.
The Chevron Energy Savings and
Infrastructure Upgrade Project, now
managed by Opterra Energy Services, is in its
second year, and is expected to be completed
in June 2016. Project costs and utility
reductions are reflected in this budget.
The budget includes the following
recommended staffing changes in the
Building Maintenance program (70):
 Eliminate one (1.0 FTE)) vacant
Senior Building Maintenance Worker
position
 Add one (1.0 FTE) Building
Maintenance Worker position
No Capital Assets are requested for this
budget; however, two D-rated pickups will be
replaced by two B-rated pickups transferred
from Information Technology.
Building Maintenance
Professional and Specialized Services are
recommended to include known recurring
contract work such as elevator maintenance,
fire extinguisher maintenance, pest control
services and card access system repairs and
monitoring. This budget includes $140,000
for an anticipated building security services
contract to provide security guards at
vulnerable locations.
Maintenance of Structure & Improvements is
recommended at $92,000 to cover planned
maintenance projects not budgeted in Plant
Acquisition (1-801).
This budget includes a request to purchase
the Facilities module of the WIN–CAMS
cost system. This module will provide:
 A Building Ledger with Occupancy
and Asset Values
 Tracking Costs associated with each
building based on Services Types,
Projects and Occupancy
 Work Order system
 Preventative Maintenance system
 Reporting
This module will work in conjunction with
the General Services and Fleet modules of
WIN-CAMS and will allow for greater
efficiencies for staff as well as a complete
asset system for each of the buildings,
including electronic versions of construction
and remodel plans, age of HVAC systems
and repairs made, and tracking of all
occupancies. The cost for this module is
$13,600 with an ongoing annual maintenance
cost of $1,050.
In order to most efficiently utilize this
module, the budget also includes a $10,000
request for tablets for the Building Maintenance staff to access the system while
away from the office. This will improve
efficiency by allowing staff to complete work
and move on to other jobs without having to
return to Facilities.
This budget is recommended at $16,351,
which is a decrease of $609 (3.6%) compared
to FY 2015-16. All funding is provided
through fines and interest.
The Special Department Expense – Fish and
Game account reflects expenses related to
programs, events, and donations such as:
 Purchase of pheasants
 Support of duck egg projects
 Yuba Sutter Fair booth
 Donations of equipment to the Game
Wardens
 Donations to support special events,
programs, and projects
The Special Department Expense – Youth
Programs account reflects expenses
specifically tied to youth educational
programs, events and donations such as:
 Youth fishing derbies
 Salmon aquarium programs
 School educational programs and
field trips
 Shady Creek Outdoor School
scholarships
This budget is recommended at $1,605,197
which is an increase of $29,292 (1.9%) over
FY 2015-16. The Fleet Management budget
unit operates as an ISF and must balance
revenues to expenditures within the fund.
This budget includes a recommendation to
eliminate one (1.0 FTE) Equipment
Mechanic II position and replace it with a
Heavy/Light Equipment Mechanic position.
There was a retirement during FY 2014-15 of
a Heavy Equipment Mechanic and that
position was eliminated in the FY 2015-16
budget. With approval of the Board, during
FY 2015-16, the General Services
Department, in conjunction with the Human
Resources Department, explored the
possibility of evaluating the job descriptions
and adding a mid-range position between the
Heavy Equipment Mechanic and the
Equipment Mechanic II. During
FY 2015-16, the Equipment Mechanic II staff
were offered training to prepare them to fill
this requested position. One staff member
elected to take the training and is ready to fill
the position when implemented in FY 2016-17. It is requested that the position
be allowed to be filled effective July 1, 2016
and the vacant Mechanic II position be
eliminated.
Due to the volatility in the price of fuel, it is
difficult to accurately estimate future cost.
Based on current fuel prices and recent
fluctuations, the Recommended Budget for
FY 2015-16 includes $506,688 for the
purchase of fuel for the majority of County
departments. This represents a 4.1% increase
compared to FY 2015-16.
The Recommended Budget includes
$118,469 in Interfund Plant Acquisition
charges for two projects.
Oil/Water Separator
The present vehicle washing system does
not have the capability to separate the water
from oil. This is a re-budget from an
approved project in FY 2015-16 for
$93,469.
Awning
The budget also includes a request to add an
awning to the building to help shield the sun
and deflect the rain coming in when the
doors are open. The estimated cost is
$25,000.
This budget is recommended at $4,546,479.
The Information Technology budget unit
operates as an ISF and must balance revenues to
expenditures within the fund. The
recommended budget results in a decrease of
$175,337 (3.7%) in Interfund Information
Technology charges to County departments
compared to FY 2015-16. The Interfund
Information Technology account represents the
total of all charges made to County departments
for Information Technology services.
Therefore, the decrease equals the amount that
has been decreased in other County department
budgets for FY 2016-17.
The Information Technology division is
undergoing modernization efforts. The future
direction of technology in the County is
transitioning from developing and supporting
custom in-house legacy applications to webbased
and commercial “off the shelf”
solutions. This change in vision and mission
requires more network and system
administrators and fewer programmers in
order to succeed. Due to this change, it is
recommended that one (1.0 FTE) Network
Administrator I position be added and one (1.0 FTE) Programming Analyst II position
be eliminated, which results in a layoff. This
change results in a budget savings of
$29,432.
The Recommended Budget also includes the
addition of one (1.0 FTE) Information
Security Analyst position. This position will
be responsible for planning and
implementing security measures to protect
computer systems, networks and data. The
analyst will also be responsible for
preventing data loss and service interruptions
by researching new technologies that will
effectively protect a network. Additional
duties include:
 Creating, testing and implementing
network disaster recovery plans
 Performing risk assessments and
testing of information systems
 Installing firewalls, data encryption
and other security measures
 Recommending security
enhancements and purchases
 Training staff on network and
information security procedures.
Capital Assets are recommended at $193,000
as follows:
 Enterprise Wireless Network
Implementation: $100,000
This recommendation is for the
deployment of a County-wide enterprise
wireless network. Wi-Fi has become
ubiquitous in everyday life and our
customers have come to expect Internet
access in county facilities. Providing Wi-
Fi service has become essential, and as
technology has advanced, both County
staff and guests want secure, easy access
and a fast connection. This project
includes multiple integrated
systems/software.
 Deduplication Backup Target
Appliance: $40,000
This recommendation will upgrade the
enterprise data protection architecture
with a deduplication backup target
appliance. The appliance is an easy-tomanage
platform that consolidates
backup, archive and disaster recovery.
The appliance will allow us to reduce
backup costs by reducing tape media.
Deduplication reduces the amount of disk
storage needed for backup data by an
average of 10-30 times and is an
economical replacement for tape.
Greatly increased backup and recovery
speeds will also be realized by using an
appliance and will result in better backup
and recovery service levels.
 Two Replacement Vehicles: $53,000
It is recommended to replace two 14 year
old B-rated small Ford Ranger pickup
trucks with compact, energy efficient
CMAX type vehicles. Information
Technology no longer has a use for
pickup trucks because the items
transported have become much smaller
and lighter weight: LED monitors and
small form factor PCs. In addition, IT no
longer performs dump runs nor has a need
to transport large quantities of equipment.
The two B rated pickups will be
transferred to Facilities Management and
two D rated pickups will be sent to
surplus. It is recommended that the recommended
capital assets be approved for purchase
effective July 1, 2016.
This budget is recommended at $697,792.
The recommendation includes one project
that were authorized in prior years and are
continuing in FY 2016-17, as well as 11 new
projects for FY 2016-17.
It is recommended that immediate
authorization be given to continue work on
the prior year projects that are being rebudgeted
and both Development Services
and General Services departments to
commence work on the new projects, without
waiting for the adoption of the final budget
resolution.
Both the Development Services and General
Services Departments concur with this
recommendation.
Continuing Projects
The Development Services Director, General
Services Director, and County Administrator
are recommending that one previously
authorized project, an Oil/Water Separator
System Project for Fleet Management, be
rebudgeted in FY 2016-17. This continuing
project, which ensures environmental
wastewater compliance, totals $93,469. Recommended New Projects
The chart on the following page summarizes
the 11 new projects recommended for
approval, and indicates the funding source for
each project. The total of the newly requested
projects for FY 2016-17 is $604,323. Of this,
$485,232 is estimated to be a General Fund
Cost.
Since 2011, Sutter County has been making
ongoing improvements to its facilities to
ensure compliance with the Americans with
Disabilities Act. These improvements are
budgeted at $32,035 for FY 2016-17
This budget is recommended at $656,001.
The recommendation includes the principal
and interest payment amount due for
FY 2016-17. 
This budget is recommended at $186,879
which is an increase of $61,534 (49.1%) over
FY 2015-16. The General Fund provides
77.5% of the financing for this budget unit
and is increased by
This budget is recommended at $34,532,
which is an increase of $7,226 (26.5%) over
FY 2015-16. The General Fund provides
72.2% of the financing for this budget unit
and is increased by $4,826 (24.0%) compared
to FY 2015-16.
The Recommended Budget includes
estimated rental revenues of $9,600, an
increase of $2,400 for FY 2016-17. This
increase reflects actual rental revenue over
the past four years.
During FY 2015-16 rentals included:
 16 Paid
 11 Un-Paid
The Community Memorial Museum
Commission is estimated to receive $4,134,
which represents half of the net rental
revenue (less rental expenses). The
remaining half of the net rental revenue is
returned to the General Fund to repay the
General Fund loan used to construct the
facility.
This budget is recommended at $205,095.
This is a decrease of $11,046 (5.1%)
compared to FY 2015-16. The General Fund
does not provide funding for this budget unit.
All funding is provided by the water/
wastewater systems maintained by the Water/
Wastewater Operator position.
The budget includes $58,000 in Maintenance
of Structures as follows:
 Clay Valve Replacement - $5,000
 Booster Pump Rebuilds - $10,000
 Back Wash Tank Cleaning / Repairs
- $23,000
 Step Tank Cleaning - $20,000
There is $15,000 budgeted in General
Supplies to cover supplies needed for
operations including:
 Chlorine
 Pumps
 Step Tanks
 General Supplies
 Replacement of worn filters/pumps
The budget contains $24,000 in Professional
and Specialized Services to cover costs
related to operations such as:
 Step Tank Pumping $15,000
 Water Sample Testing $7,200
 Other misc. services $1,800
This budget is recommended at $24,613,
which is a decrease of $11,013 (30.9%)
compared to FY 2015-16. This budget unit
does not receive any funding from the
General Fund.
This budget is recommended at $501,330,
which is an increase of $39,151 (8.5%) over
FY 2015-16.
The $131,833 unreimbursed cost, which is an
increase of $60,221 (84.1%) compared to
FY 2015-16, represents the Public Health
Department’s share of the Human Services
Administration budget. This increase is
primarily due to an additional $57,200
budgeted in Interfund Capital Projects. This
Unreimbursed Cost is, in concept, partially
funded by the General Fund through the
General Fund’s contribution to the Health
Fund.
The Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) and the Health Information Technology for
Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH)
Act require health care providers to have in
place privacy and security protections for
health information. These privacy and
security protections were required to be in
place in 2005-06. Part of this process
included a risk analysis to conduct an
accurate and thorough assessment of the
potential risks and vulnerabilities to the
confidentiality, integrity, and availability of
electronic protected health information.
Since it has been about ten years since this
was last accomplished the Department is
recommending that another risk analysis be
performed; $25,000 has been included in the
Professional and Specialized Services
account to accomplish this task.
Renewed efforts are being made to evaluate
the feasibility of creating a “one stop shop”
for the Human Services Department
functions. Additionally, discussions have
been held with Rideout Regional Healthcare
to lease the former Sun Ridge Hospital
property on Stabler Lane for our CPS/APS,
Children’s Mental Health Outpatient and
System of Care programming. Relocation of
the CPS/APS and Youth Services programs
will serve to address concerns voiced in past
years by the Sutter County Grand Jury
regarding the condition of the modular units
that currently house those functions. The
FY 2016-17 budget includes $57,200 in
Capital Projects funding for consultant and
engineering expenses associated with these
projects.
 This budget is recommended at $6,327,755,
which is an increase of $105,275 (1.7%) over
FY 2015-16.
The County has a required contribution of
$674,240 to satisfy the County’s AB8 required
match (which is interpreted to remain intact
following the passage of AB 85). The County’s
contribution is reflected in the Health General
budget unit (4-110) and the Health – County
Share budget unit (4-112). The balance of cost
for the Health budget unit is covered by 1991
Realignment revenue.
Due to the closure of the Public Health
Laboratory it is recommended to eliminate one
vacant and defunded Public Health
Microbiologist position and one vacant and
defunded Director of Public Health Lab. In
FY 2015-16 it was recommended to eliminate a
vacated Public Health Lab Technician.
In addition the following position changes are
recommended effective July 1, 2016.
 Eliminate one vacant and defunded
Account Clerk I/II position
 Eliminate one vacated Account Clerk
III position.
 Add one Accountant I/II position
 Transfer a portion (0.1 FTE) of the Health Officer position out of Jail
Medical (4-134) back to the Health
budget unit
The Department anticipates a reduction in
SNAP-Ed grant funding, therefore instead of
defunding one (1.0 FTE) Health Program
Specialist position in SNAP-Ed effective
October 1, 2016, it is being recommended to
use the existing full time HPS to fulfill the
combined duties of addressing the Homeless
population health concerns, grant writing, and
Accreditation Coordinator duties. In essence
this position would no longer be grant funded,
but covered with County contribution and 1991
Realignment.
Capital Assets are recommended at $77,000 for
a telephone system and keycard security system
upgrade.
Residual Equity Transfer-Out is budgeted at
$71,261 for payment of the Department’s share
of the Opterra Energy Efficiency Project. The
Health facility had solar panels constructed that
will offset Utility costs as well as Lighting and
HVAC upgrades to help reduce the
Departments energy usage.
Of the 51.98 FTE positions contained in the
Health Division budget, 29.55 FTE positions
are directly grant funded.
This budget is recommended at $2,687,172,
which is an increase of $6,182 (0.2%) over
FY 2015-16.
The following position changes are
recommended effective July 1, 2016: add a
part-time (0.5 FTE) Physician - Contract
position to serve as the Medical Director for the
Jail, eliminate vacant Nurse Practitioner II
position, and transfer a portion (0.1 FTE) of the
Health Officer out of Jail Medical back to the
Health budget unit (4-103).
Costs related to the provision of health care to
individuals held at or incarcerated in the County
Jail, including administration costs, have
traditionally been funded by a combination of
1991 Realignment funding and General Fund
contributions (prior to the State’s
implementation of 1991 Realignment, services
were funded through a combination of general
revenues and AB8 funding). For the fiscal
years 2012-13 through 2014-15, due to a
significant decline in 1991 Realignment
revenues and other county revenue sources
(related to the Recession) and based on a
request from the Human Services Director, it
was recommended that all Jail Medical services
costs be removed from the Health budget unit
(4-103) and placed into a separate budget unit (4-134), and that any costs not funded by
AB109 Public Safety Realignment funds be
funded entirely by the General Fund.
Beginning again for FY 2015-16, due in part to
an increase in MVIL 1991 Realignment
funding through the recent passage of AB85, a
relatively small portion of expense currently
shown in the Jail Medical budget unit is
recommended to be funded by 1991
Realignment funds. This budget
recommendation, in essence, funds $365,355 of
Jail Medical expenses with 1991 Realignment
funds, with the balance funded by approved
AB109 funds and the General Fund.
The total cost of Jail Medical services is costapplied
back to the Jail budget through a
separate Interfund Transfer between the Jail
budget unit (2-301) and the General Revenues
budget unit (1-209). It should be noted that this
transfer is for presentation purposes, and does
not result in any increased cost or revenue in the
overall budget.
Support & Care of Persons expense reflects
direct expenditures related to the
hospitalizations and other outside care of
inmates. This line item is recommended at
$628,258, which is a decrease of $71,742
compared to FY 2015-16. During FY 2014-15
the County signed a contract with CorrectCare-
Integrated Health, Inc. to provide claims
processing services and utilization
management, which should continue to
decrease the expenditures related to Support
and Care.
This budget is recommended at $599,370, with
a net cost of $574,370, which is an increase of
$2,746 (0.5%) over FY 2015-16.
The County is currently in a multi-year contract
with Bi-County Ambulance Services for
indigent medical transportation. The annual
cost for these services is $26,400.
The County share for participation in the EMS
Agency is recommended at $51,208. The
anticipated cost for participation in this joint
powers agreement is based on California State
Department of Finance projections for the
population of Sutter County. This cost is
partially offset with a transfer in from the
Emergency Medical Services Special Revenue
Fund (0-252), in the amount of $25,000.
This budget continues to reflect the CMSP
Participation Fee of $188,781, as set by statute,
for the County to participate in the CMSP.
The budget also includes $332,981 to be
transferred to the Environmental Health budget
unit (2-725).
This budget is recommended at $280,848,
which is increased by $445 (0.2%) over
FY 2015-16.
At this time, the State has not determined the
amount of its contribution to the Sutter
County CCS Program for FY 2016-17. As
mentioned above, in the past, as a policy
item, the County has budgeted an amount in
excess of the county share of cost in order to
meet the potential demand for service, which
can be very volatile. The budget
recommendation for $210,368 is consistent
with the Board of Supervisors’ past policy in
this area and is the same as the prior year’s
Adopted Budget. However, the Board could
opt to reduce this budget request to the
minimum county share of cost of $154,465,
to match a potential reduced State
contribution. At this time it is not known
whether the State contribution would match
the amount appropriated.
This budget is recommended at $174,402,
which is an increase of $5,500 (3.3%) over
FY 2015-16.
This budget is recommended at $26,313,210,
which is an increase of $1,699,343 (6.9%)
over FY 2015-16.
This budget unit receives no financing from
the General Fund. The sources of funding for
Sutter-Yuba Mental Health Services are
shown in the Mental Health Revenue Sources
chart. Mental Health’s funding history is
shown graphically in the Mental Health
Budget History chart.
The increase in total cost is largely due to
increased costs for personnel and for
contracted services.
The following new positions are recommended
to be effective July 1, 2016:
 Add one Rehabilitation Clinician position
to be recruited as a registered occupational
therapist or recreational therapist - 62.5%
funded by the Mental Health budget with
the remainder funded by the Mental Health
Services Act budget (4-104)
 Add one Crisis Counselor - 50% funded by
the Mental Health budget with the remainder funded by the Mental Health
Services Act budget (4-104)
 Add one flexibly-staffed Psychiatric
Technician/LVN position
 Add one flexibly-staffed Medical Clerk I/II
position
Capital Assets are recommended at $99,450 for
the purchase of four replacement vehicles. The
Department has requested three mid-sized
sedans and one small SUV.
Residual Equity Transfer-Out is budgeted at
$46,698 for payment of the Department’s share
of the Opterra Energy Efficiency Project. The
Mental Health Building on Live Oak Blvd had
Lighting and HVAC upgrades to help reduce
the building’s energy usage. In addition, the
properties on Plumas and E. Onstott Rd will
benefit from the Acacia property Solar Panel array
that will offset Utility costs. This payment
reflects Mental Health’s proportional share of
the payment.
It remains SYMHS’ objective to keep the
Mental Health budget and the Mental Health
Services Act budget in balance and to fully
utilize all available funding in a fashion most
advantageous to our counties.
This budget is recommended at $10,406,385,
which is an increase of $235,110 (2.3%)
compared to FY 2015-16. MHSA program
expenses are funded by revenue from the
State and from the Federal share of
reimbursement for services claimed to Medi-
Cal. This budget unit receives no financing
from the General Fund. See Figures 1 and 2
in the Mental Health (4-102) budget narrative
for information on Mental Health funding
sources and history.
The following new positions are recommended
to be effective July 1, 2016:
 Add one Rehabilitation Clinician position
to be recruited as a registered occupational
therapist or recreational therapist - 37.5%
funded by the MHSA budget with the
remainder funded by the Mental Health
budget (4-102).
 Add one Crisis Counselor - 50% funded by
the MHSA budget with the remainder
funded by the Mental Health budget
(4-102).
It remains SYMHS’ objective to keep the
Mental Health budget and the Mental Health
Services Act budget in balance and to fully
utilize all available funding in a fashion most
advantageous to our counties.
This budget is recommended at $23,561,071
which is an increase of $1,122,653 (5%)
compared to FY 2015-16. The Welfare and
Social Services fund, as a whole, receives
$449,000 in financing from the General Fund
in order to meet the County’s Maintenance of
Effort (MOE) for receipt of CalWORKs and
related Realignment funding.
Capital Assets are recommended at $66,000
for the purchase of three replacement
vehicles. The Department has requested
three mid-size sedans.
It is recommended to add the following
positions effective July 1, 2016:
 One Office Assistant II position
 Two Staff Services Analyst positions
 One Social Worker III - Child
Services position
 One Program Manager position
Residual Equity Transfer-Out is budgeted at
$44,082 for payment of the Department’s
share of the Opterra Energy Efficiency
Project. The Welfare facility at 190 Garden
Hwy had solar panels constructed that will
offset Utility costs as well as Lighting and
HVAC upgrades to help reduce the
Departments energy usage. While the
Welfare facility at 539 Garden Hwy will
benefit from the Acacia property Solar Panel
array that will offset Utility costs.
During FY 2011-12, Public Safety
Realignment was implemented, which
realigned the responsibility for many
programs from the State to counties. Because
of this shift in funding, Sutter County was
mandated to establish the County Local
Revenue Fund 2011 (0-140). For
FY 2012-13, the Social Services
Realignment Fund 2011 (0-245) was
established to transfer funds from the County
Local Revenue Fund 2011 to the operating
budgets of the Welfare and Social Services
Division. The shift in funding simply
changed the flow of funding from the State to
the County without affecting the overall
amount of funding for programs. The County
Local Revenue Fund 2011 and the Social
Services Realignment Fund 2011 are
discussed in greater detail in their own budget
narratives.
This budget is recommended at $272,341,
which is a decrease of $8,790 (3.1%)
compared to FY 2015-16. The General Fund
provides 27.1% of the funding for this budget
unit.
The percentage and manor in which the
Mental Health budget unit (4-102) is paying
for LPS cases, through Interfund MH Admin
Conservator Services account (#46519), was
evaluated and the Department provided an
update to the payment process and amounts
which resulted in an increase in interfund
revenue.
This budget is recommended at $1,893,477,
which is an increase of $64,031 (3.5%)
compared to FY 2015-16. This increase
represents adjustment to FY 2015-16 which
was based on the preliminary County IHSS
MOE and the inflation factor of 3.5% based
on the final County IHSS MOE. The
inflation factor increase of 3.5% is part of the
implementation of SB 1036 which
established an MOE for each county’s IHSS
expenses. The County’s MOE is met with
Welfare and Social Services 1991
Realignment funds (0-248). Any costs over
the MOE amount are paid by the State.
The General Fund does not provide any
financing to this budget unit.
This budget is recommended at $9,660,000,
which is a decrease of $180,000 (1.8%)
compared to FY 2015-16.
The FY 2013-14 State budget passed by the
Legislature includes funding to provide a
five-percent grant increase effective March 1,
2014. AB 85 amended the Welfare and
Institutions Code Section 17600.10(a)(5) that
requires counties to establish a new
subaccount wherein funds for the fivepercent
grant increase will be deposited. The
five-percent increase will be funded through
the redirection of 1991 Realignment general
growth revenues from Social Services and
Health to a new 1991 subaccount created for
this purpose. Counties will not have a share
of cost for grant increases provided from
funding in the new subaccount, the Family
Support Fund (0-227).
Also effective FY 2013-14, the State has
started remitting SB1041 TANF child
support collections pass-through funds to the
County.
Commencing FY 2014-15, Welfare and
Institutions Code Section 17601.50 requires
the State to provide additional funding to the
Family Support Fund for CalWORKs grant
increases. This is funded through the
redirection of 1991 Realignment sales tax
and sales tax growth revenues from Social
Services and Health.
The General Fund does not provide any
financing to this budget unit. The County’s
share of cost is met with Welfare and Social
Services 1991 Realignment funds.
As in previous fiscal years, the State’s share
of TANF costs, which is realized as revenue
by the County, flows through the County
Local Revenue Fund 2011 (0-140) as
opposed to being directly received by the
Division through the Welfare and Social
Services Fund as had occurred in the past.
The County Local Revenue Fund 2011 is
discussed in greater detail in its own budget
narrative.
This budget is recommended at $5,967,550
which is an increase of $351,850 (6.3%) over
FY 2015-16. The General Fund does not
provide any financing to this budget unit.
The County’s share of cost is met with
Welfare and Social Services 1991
Realignment funds.
The State’s share of Foster Care costs, which
is realized as revenue by the County, flows
from the County Local Revenue Fund 2011
(0-140) through the Social Services
Realignment Fund 2011 (0-245) as opposed
to being directly received by the Division
through the Welfare and Social Services
Fund as had occurred in the past. The County
Local Revenue Fund 2011 and the Social
Services Realignment Fund 2011 are
discussed in greater detail in their own budget
narratives.
This budget is recommended at $14,800,
which is unchanged compared to
FY 2015-16. The General Fund does not
provide any financing to this budget unit.
This budget unit is 100% federally funded.
This budget is recommended at $4,874,400
which is a decrease of $111,600 (2.2%)
compared to FY 2015-16. The General Fund
does not provide any financing to this budget
unit. The County’s share of cost is met with
Welfare and Social Services 1991
Realignment funds (0-248).
The State’s share of Adoption costs, which is
realized as revenue by the County, flows
from the County Local Revenue Fund 2011
(0-140) through the Social Services
Realignment Fund 2011 (0-245) as opposed
to being directly received by the Division
through the Welfare and Social Services
Fund as had occurred in the past. The County
Local Revenue Fund 2011 and the Social
Services Realignment Fund 2011 are
discussed in greater detail in their own budget
narratives.
This budget is recommended at $69,120,
which is an increase of $2,160 (3.2%) over
FY 2015-16. The General Fund provides
95.4% of the financing for this budget unit.
This budget is recommended at $2,979,852,
which is a decrease of $323 (0.0%) compared
to FY 2015-16. This budget unit does not
receive any funding from the General Fund.
All funding is provided through State and
Federal sources as set forth above.
It is recommended to defunded and hold
vacant one (1.0 FTE) Child Support Specialist
I position and eliminate one (1.0 FTE) vacant
Child Support Specialist I position.
Over the years, staff has manually entered
positions into the budget system. With the
upgrade to ONESolution a reconciliation of the
position allocation schedules has been
done. For this budget unit, it was discovered
that one unfunded position had been removed
from the budget allocation table, while it has no net effect on budget it is important to have
an accurate reflection of all positions.
Residual Equity Transfer-Out is budgeted at
$11,858 for payment of the Department’s
share of the Opterra Energy Efficiency Project.
Child Support Services will benefit from the
Acacia property Solar Panel array that will
offset Utility costs.
This budget is recommended at $4,084,137,
which is an increase of $456,771 (12.6%)
over FY 2015-16. The General Fund provides
58.2% of the financing for the District
Attorney’s Office and is increased by
$402,612 (13.3%) compared to FY 2015-16.
It should be noted that these funding
calculations reflect the addition of Public
Safety Augmentation Funds (Proposition
172), which are transferred into the Public
Safety fund through the Public Safety
General budget unit (2-210). California
voters enacted Proposition 172 in 1993,
which established a permanent statewide
half-cent sales tax for support of local public
safety functions. Proposition 172 funding is
budgeted at $7.4 million for FY 2016-17.
The full amount received is to be transferred
from the Public Safety Augmentation Fund
(0-282) to the Public Safety Fund (0-015) in
FY 2016-17. In FY 2016-17, the General
Fund is budgeted to contribute approximately
$17.4 million in funding to the Public Safety
fund in excess of the Proposition 172
funding.
The new Sutter County Courthouse opened
on January 19, 2016 on Civic Center
Boulevard. The District Attorney’s Office
has not yet been moved to a location near the
new courthouse. This is causing inefficiency
as staff are now required to commute across
town to attend court, where staff previously
could walk to court. A secondary impact is
increased expense due to the requirement for
additional vehicles. Currently, additional vehicles are being rented; however, plans are
being made to either lease or purchase
additional vehicles so the rental vehicles can
be returned. This plan, with a budget
amendment, will be brought before the Board
of Supervisors for consideration once a
decision has been made.
A new location for the District Attorney’s
Office is being sought. It is expected that the
Office will be able to move during
FY 2016-17. Any related expenses, such as
remodeling of office space, will also be
brought separately to the Board of
Supervisors for consideration.
Two Senior Criminal Investigator positions,
previously funded by the Welfare and Social
Services Division of the Department of
Human Services have returned to full-time
work in the District Attorney’s Office. These
positions are recommended to be maintained
and funded due to the greatly increased need
for investigated services that has
accompanied the highly technical nature of
criminal activities within the County that
require extensive investigation. This
includes technology based investigative
requirements such as cell phone and
computer forensics.
It is recommended to restore funding for one
Deputy District Attorney I position effective
July 1, 2016. This is recommended due to
increased caseloads, in addition to the
complexity of cases being prosecuted. This
position will be funded by the General Fund for
FY 2016-17.
It is recommended to add one Deputy District
Attorney I position effective July 1, 2016.
This is a grant funded, Limited Term position
in the Victim/Witness Assistance Program.
It is recommended to restore funding for one
Senior Criminal Investigator position
effective July 1, 2016. This is a grant funded,
Limited Term position in the Victim/Witness
Assistance Program.
Lastly, it is recommended to add two Victim
Advocate positions effective July 1, 2016.
These are grant funded, Limited Term
positions in the Victim/Witness Assistance
Program.
The recommended budget does not include
the use of Local Anti-Drug Programs (0-264)
funds and District Attorney Asset Forfeiture
Trust (0-293) funds at this time. These
special revenue funds supplement the District
Attorney’s Office’s efforts to investigate and
prosecute crime. As of July 1, 2016, the fund
balance of Local Anti-Drug Programs Fund
(0-264) is projected to be $29,000. The fund
balance of District Attorney Asset Forfeiture
Trust Fund (0-293) is projected to be
$47,500.
 This budget is recommended at $42,173,
which is an increase of $497 (1.2%) over
FY 2015-16. The General Fund provides
100% of the financing for this budget unit. It should be noted that many of the
expenditures incurred by each year’s Grand
Jury are authorized in Government Code and
are not restricted by the County’s annual
budget. These expenditure items are based
on the needs of each year’s Grand Jury and
may vary from year to year. The County
ultimately has limited ability to affect or
predict expenditures.
This budget is recommended at $6,670,112,
which is an increase of $572,773 (9.4%) over
FY 2015-16. The General Fund provides
approximately 43.8% of the funding for this
budget unit and is increased by $266,555
(10.0%) compared to FY 2015-16.
In FY 2014-15, two positions were unfunded
(one vacant Supervising Probation Officer and
one vacant Deputy Probation Officer) coupled
with the deletion of an Accounting Technician
II position, to reduce the overall General
Fund contribution to the Department. In
FY 2015-16, an additional funded, but vacant
Deputy Probation Officer position was left
vacant in order to comply with a status quo
budget recommendation. While it is
recommended that the previously unfunded
positions remain frozen in FY 2016-17, non-
General Fund monies are now available to fill
the vacant, allocated Deputy Probation Officer
position. The position will be filled and utilized
as a school resource officer at Gray Avenue
Middle School.
The current organizational structure represents
a reasonable span of control for all supervisory
positions within the Department. Specifically, the supervisor-to-staff ratio for the Supervising
Probation Officer positions as recommended is
one supervisor per 6.2 officers (1:6.2). The
probation industry standard ranges between one
supervisor for every six officers (1:6) and one
supervisor for every eight officers (1:8).
It is recommended that one additional bilingual
slot be added to the Department, which allows
for six total bilingual slots.
Capital Assets are recommended at $98,500 for
the purchase of three replacement vehicles. The
vehicles requested to be replaced are at least 15
years old, have high mileage and are in poor
condition. Recommended replacement vehicle
purchases are as follows:
 $38,500 for a Patrol Utility Vehicle
funded by a cancellation of obligated
fund balance from the General Fund’s
Designation for Future Vehicle
Replacement account (#31209)
 $37,500 for a Patrol Utility Vehicle
funded by JJCPA funds
 $22,500 for a Mid-Size Sedan funded
by YOBG funds
Residual Equity Transfer-Out is budgeted at
$44,574 for payment of the Department’s share
of the Opterra Energy Efficiency Project. The
Probation Department facility on Boyd Street
had solar panel covered parking constructed
that offsets Utilities costs as well as Lighting
and HVAC upgrades to help reduce the
Departments energy usage. In addition, the
Probation building on Center St will benefit
from the Acacia property Solar Panel array that
will offset Utility costs. This payment reflects
the Probation Department’s proportional share
of the total payment.
This budget unit receives $71,000 in
Realignment (1991) funds, which are
transferred from the Local Health and Welfare
Trust, Social Services Fund (0-248).
 This budget is recommended at $1,000, which is
the same as FY 2015-16. This budget unit does
not receive any financing from the General
Fund as it is funded by Realignment funds,
which are transferred from the Local Health and
Welfare Trust, Social Services Fund (0-248).
This budget is recommended at $2,181,880,
which is an increase of $611,880 (39.0%)
over FY 2015-16. The General Fund
provides 59.5% of the funding for this budget
unit (as explained below) and is increased by
$301,880 (19.4%) for FY 2016-17.
It should be noted that these funding
calculations reflect the addition of Public
Safety Augmentation Funds (Proposition
172), which are transferred into the Public
Safety fund through the Public Safety
General budget unit (2-210). California
voters enacted Proposition 172 in 1993,
which established a permanent statewide
half-cent sales tax for support of local public
safety functions. Proposition 172 funding is
budgeted at $7.4 million for FY 2016-17.
The full amount received is to be transferred from the Public Safety Augmentation Fund
(0-282) to the Public Safety Fund (0-015) in
FY 2016-17. Annual Proposition 172
revenue, is projected to equal $7.4 million for
FY 2016-17. In FY 2016-17, the General
Fund is budgeted to contribute approximately
$17.5 million in funding to the Public Safety
fund in excess of the Proposition 172
funding.
Part of the increase in the Juvenile Hall budget
is due to the addition of a Supervising Probation
Officer position that is responsible for
conducting Internal Affairs investigations,
applicant background checks, and training, and
to assist Intervention Counselors with case
planning. This is a new position that is needed
to provide support and to carry out the
aforementioned administrative duties. In
FY 2015-16, the JPA approved three additional
Juvenile Correctional Officer positions, and an
Intervention Counselor position to comply with
Federal Title 15 regulations regarding staff to
youth ratios, and assessment and case planning
requirements.
The project to build the new Tri-County
Regional Juvenile Rehabilitation Center is
continuing to progress. The cost of design
and construction of the new facility is to
remain at the previously agreed upon ratio of
40/40/20 for Sutter, Yuba and Colusa
counties respectively. For Sutter County’s
share of project costs in FY 2016-17,
$310,000 has been budgeted in Contribution
to Other Agencies.
This budget is recommended at $690,272,
which is an increase of $2,441 (0.4%) over
FY 2015-16. The General Fund provides
92.2% of the financing for this budget unit
and is decreased by $1,762 (0.3%) compared
to FY 2015-16.
Though the Superior Court is ordering in
some cases, as a condition of probation,
payment of a nominal fee for reimbursement
to the County of Sutter for the services of the
Public Defender’s Office, it is difficult to
predict how much revenue will be received
for FY 2016-17. The Sutter County Public
Defender’s Office has been able to collect for
services rendered to those who have been
involuntarily held at private psychiatric
centers. Based upon the first 10 months of
FY 2015-16, it is anticipated the Department
should receive reimbursement revenues
totaling $6,200 for FY 2016-17.
This budget is recommended at $30,200,191,
which is an increase of $3,391,320 (12.7%)
compared to FY 2015-16. All funding is
provided by the State through Public Safety
Realignment.
As previously stated, this fund is designed to be
a “pass-through” budget where, upon deposit,
funds will immediately be transferred out to the
appropriate operating budget or special
revenue fund, as budgeted. Funds budgeted to
be used completely each fiscal year will pass
through to an operating budget, while funds not
used completely in a single fiscal year will
pass-through to a special revenue fund, such
that any unused funds will remain separate
across budget years. This prevents fund
balances from becoming co-mingled and will
allow each department responsible for these
realigned funds to accurately and more easily
track the expenditure and fund balance of
individual revenue streams.
This budget is recommended at $3,474,720,
which is an increase of $545,802 (18.6%) over
FY 2015-16. The General Fund provides
approximately 55.9% of the financing for the
Sheriff’s Department and is increased in the
Communications budget by $626,785 (23.2%)
compared to FY 2015-16.
It should be noted that these funding
calculations reflect the addition of Public
Safety Augmentation Funds (Proposition
172), which are transferred into the Public
Safety fund through the Public Safety General
Budget unit (2-210). California voters enacted
Proposition 172 in 1993, which established a
permanent statewide half-cent sales tax for
support of local public safety functions.
Proposition 172 funding is budgeted at $7.4
million for FY 2016-17. The full amount
received is to be transferred from the Public
Safety Augmentation Fund (0-282) to the
Public Safety Fund (0-015) in FY 2016-17. In
FY 2016-17, the General Fund is budgeted to
contribute approximately $17.4 million in
funding to the Public Safety fund in excess of
the Proposition 172 funding.
It is recommended that the requested position
changes – restore funding for one Supervising
Public Safety Dispatcher position, eliminate
one vacant Public Safety Dispatcher position,
and restore funding for one Criminal Records
Technician position - be approved effective
July 1, 2016.
Capital Assets are recommended at $574,749
for three radio dispatch stations, which
includes a contingency of 10%. It is
recommended that the purchase of the three
replacement radio dispatch stations be
approved for purchase as of July 1, 2016 to
ensure the replacement project is completed before the current systems are no longer
serviceable.
 This budget is recommended at $868,544,
which is an increase of $108,630 (14.3%)
compared to FY 2015-16. The General Fund
does not provide any financing for this budget
unit as it is funded by Realignment revenues and
an agreement with the Superior Court for
security services. The new Sutter County Courthouse opened on
January 19, 2016. Funding for two additional
Correctional Officer positions (Bailiffs),
approved during FY 2015-16, is provided by the
State through Public Safety Realignment.
Funding for one Deputy Sheriff position to
provide security services at the main entrance of
the Courthouse is provided through an
agreement with the Superior Court.
Trial Court Security was a component of Public
Safety Realignment in FY 2011-12. Therefore,
funding is first deposited into the County Local
Revenue Fund 2011 (0-140) in the Trial Court
Security (2-105) budget unit before it is
transferred into this operating budget. The
County Local Revenue Fund 2011 is discussed
in greater detail in its own budget narrative.
This budget is recommended at $7,225,353,
which is an increase of $469,589 (7.0%) over
FY 2015-16. The General Fund provides
approximately 55.9% of the financing for the
Sheriff’s Department and is increased in the
Sheriff-Coroner budget by $473,165 (7.6%)
compared to FY 2015-16.
It should be noted that these funding
calculations reflect the addition of Public
Safety Augmentation Funds (Proposition
172), which are transferred into the Public
Safety fund through the Public Safety
General budget unit (2-210). California
voters enacted Proposition 172 in 1993,
which established a permanent statewide
half-cent sales tax for support of local public
safety functions. Proposition 172 funding is
budgeted at $7.4 million for FY 2016-17.
The full amount received is to be transferred
from the Public Safety Augmentation Fund
(0-282) to the Public Safety Fund (0-015) in
FY 2016-17. In FY 2016-17, the General
Fund is budgeted to contribute approximately
$17.4 million in funding to the Public Safety
fund in excess of the Proposition 172
funding.
It is recommended to restore funding to two
(2.0 FTE) Deputy Sheriff positions effective
July 1, 2016.
Since FY 2008-09, the average number of
filled Deputy Sheriff positions in the Sheriff-
Coroner budget unit has been 29. The current
recommendation provides for 31 filled
Deputy Sheriff positions for FY 2016-17.
Capital Assets are recommended at $192,000
for the purchase of three (3) replacement patrol
vehicles.
Residual Equity Transfer-Out is budgeted at
$16,607 for payment of the Department’s share
of the Opterra Energy Efficiency Project. The
Development Services Building at 1130 Civic
Center Blvd had Lighting and HVAC upgrades
to help reduce the building’s energy usage. In
addition, the building will also benefit from the
Acacia property Solar Panel array that will
offset Utility costs. This payment reflects the
Sheriff’s proportional share of the building’s
total payment. In addition, the Sherriff’s
Training Center received Lighting and HVAC
upgrades to help reduce the building’s energy
usage.
COPS funds are not currently budgeted in the
FY 2016-17 Recommended Budget. The
Sheriff has not yet determined how these funds
will be used. Once that determination is made,
the Sheriff will present his recommendations
to the Board of Supervisors along with a
recommendation to amend the budget. COPS
funds may not be used to supplant current County Public Safety funding and therefore do
not reduce the General Fund contribution to
the Public Safety Fund. It is anticipated the
Sheriff-Coroner will have approximately
$340,000 in COPS front line law enforcement
funding available for use by the end of
FY 2016-17 with an additional $100,000 in
COPS funding available for use specifically in
the Jail.
This budget is recommended at $135,585, which
is an increase of $1,707 (1.3%) over
FY 2015-16. This small increase is offset by
revenue from the other two participating
agencies and CalMMET revenue transferred in
from the County Local Revenue Fund 2011
(0-140) and results in no unreimbursed cost for
the General Fund. The County Local Revenue
Fund 2011 is discussed in greater detail in its
own budget narrative. The NET 5 Secretary - Law position is allocated
in this budget unit. Sutter County pays one third
of the cost of the position’s salary and benefits.
This budget is recommended at $350,657,
which is a decrease of $10,562 (2.9%)
compared to FY 2015-16. The General Fund
provides approximately 55.9% of the
financing for the Sheriff’s Department and is
decreased in the Boat Patrol budget by
$10,181 (7.9%) compared to FY 2015-16.
It should be noted that these funding
calculations reflect the addition of Public
Safety Augmentation Funds (Proposition172), which are transferred into the Public
Safety fund through the Public Safety General
budget unit (2-210). California voters enacted
Proposition 172 in 1993, which established a
permanent statewide half-cent sales tax for
support of local public safety functions.
Proposition 172 funding is budgeted at $7.4
million for FY 2016-17. The full amount
received is to be transferred from the Public
Safety Augmentation Fund (0-282) to the
Public Safety Fund (0-015) in FY 2016-17. In
FY 2016-17, the General Fund is budgeted to
contribute approximately $17.4 million in
funding to the Public Safety fund in excess of
the Proposition 172 funding.
It is estimated that approximately 61% of the
total expenditures for the Boat Patrol budget
unit will be reimbursed by the State
Department of Boating and Waterways in
FY 2016-17. These reimbursements are
derived from boat registration fees. The
County contributes collected boat taxes and
pays for expenditures not subject to State
reimbursement. The Department of Boating
and Waterways’ allocation to Sutter County is
likely to remain at $214,800 as it has for the
past several years. Thus, any expenditure
increases beyond the allocation and collected
boat taxes become a County General Fund
cost.  
This budget is recommended at $1,418,109,
which is an increase of $44,033 (3.2%) over
FY 2015-16. The General Fund provides
approximately 55.9% of the financing for the
Sheriff’s Department and is increased in the
Sheriff – Live Oak budget by $4,751 (1.9%)
compared to FY 2015-16.
The majority of costs for patrolling the area
in and around the City of Live Oak are shared
80% by the City and 20% by the County.
However, the salary and benefits of a
Lieutenant position, all dog handling-related
items, and new patrol vehicles are costs
covered in full by the City.
The Sheriff provides some law-enforcement
services to the City of Live Oak at no charge
for which the City would have to pay if it
were to have its own police department, or if
it had a typical contract for Sheriff services.
Among these services are dispatch,detectives (for major felonies), records,
narcotics, and special enforcement detail
(SWAT). These costs are not represented in
this budget unit.
 This budget is recommended at $10,131,192,
which is an increase of $440,828 (4.5%) over
FY 2015-16. The General Fund provides
approximately 55.9% of the financing for the
Sheriff’s Department and is increased in the
Jail budget by $375,665 (4.4%) compared to
FY 2015-16. It should be noted that these funding
calculations reflect the addition of Public
Safety Augmentation Funds (Proposition
172), which are transferred into the Public
Safety fund through the Public Safety
General budget unit (2-210). California
voters enacted Proposition 172 in 1993,
which established a permanent statewide
half-cent sales tax for support of local public
safety functions. Proposition 172 funding is
budgeted at $7.4 million for FY 2016-17.
The full amount received is to be transferred
from the Public Safety Augmentation Fund
(0-282) to the Public Safety Fund (0-015) in
FY 2016-17. In FY 2016-17, the General
Fund is budgeted to contribute approximately
$17.4 million in funding to the Public Safety
fund in excess of the Proposition 172
funding.
The Jail is in the planning stage of being
expanded through the AB 900 Phase II
Construction/Expansion of County Jails
program. The envisioned project will add 28
Maximum Security male beds in a new
housing unit along with 14 Medium Security
female beds in a new housing unit.
Additionally, the project will remodel and
expand the Medical Services and Kitchen
Areas. The project’s design phase is
scheduled to be completed by the end of
FY 2015-16. This will be followed by the
construction phase lasting approximately 18
months. This project is more thoroughly
discussed in the Jail Expansion Project
budget unit (1-701).
Residual Equity Transfer-Out is budgeted at
$121,031 for payment of the Department’s
share of the Opterra Energy Efficiency Project.
The Jail on Civic Center Blvd had Lighting and
Plumbing Control upgrades to help reduce the
building’s energy usage. In addition, the
building will also benefit from the Acacia
property Solar Panel array that will offset
Utility costs. This payment reflects the Jail’s
proportional share of the building’s total
payment.
Capital Assets are recommended as follows:
 $6,759 for one replacement food
delivery cart
 $20,592 for one replacement tilt
skillet
This budget is recommended at $360,583,
which is an increase of $10,732 (3.1%) over
FY 2015-16. This fund is projected to
generate $289,500 in revenue during FY
2016-17. Therefore, $71,083 of fund balance
is being used to offset a portion of the cost of
this budget unit, as described below.
The General Fund does not provide any
financing for this budget unit. This fund is
financed by revenue generated from inmate
use of public telephones and inmate
purchases from the jail commissary.
This budget is recommended at $856,000,
which is a decrease of $95,000 (10.0%)
compared to FY 2015-16. The General Fund
provides 11.6% of the financing for this
budget unit and is decreased by $83,500
(45.7%) for FY 2016-17 due to the reduction
of the Court Shared Cost Payment (JOA).
This budget is recommended at $520,656,
which is an increase of $2,036 (0.4%) over
FY 2015-16. The General Fund provides
79.7% of the funding for this budget unit and
is increased by $10,686 (2.6%) for
FY 2016-17.
