No greater challenge or responsibility exists than to assure our residents that the District Attorney’s role is not simply to get a conviction in an individual case but to assure that justice is done and that due process was afforded the accused. This is done by always being mindful of our ethical responsibilities, being accessible to the public to explain our actions and being as transparent as possible on how we conduct ourselves in meeting our mandated and discretionary responsibilities. One step being taken in the upcoming year is to have our Inspectors (police Officers) carry body cameras. As a District Attorney’s Office, we do not have the daily patrolled-based contacts that our local law enforcement partners experience; however, we do have many public contacts that can and will be documented. Marin County is the first District Attorney’s Office in California putting in place a policy requiring and equipping with body cameras its investigative staff.

Today approximately 20 per cent of Marin’s population is 65 years of age or older. In the Bay Area, Marin County has the largest percentage of seniors among its population base and has shown the largest growth in its senior demographic. This trend is expected to continue and, in fact, accelerate in the upcoming decade. Coupled with this population demographic is the fact that nationally Marin County ranks in the 25 highest medium income counties, and, specifically in California, Marin residents have the state’s highest per capita income. This makes Marin’s seniors a prime target for financial exploitation. In order to protect our maturing population base, we need to prepare and be properly staffed to address our financial exploitation vulnerability. Putting in place a dedicated real estate and financial elder abuse investigative and prosecution team is an upcoming key challenge. Over the next year, the District Attorney will be working with other county partners to develop a funding source to meet this need.
