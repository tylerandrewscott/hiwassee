Initiatives
•
Work to increase library hours and appropriate staffing levels
•
Proactively explore new technologies, services, and best practices in an ongoing effort to improve services and create a better environment for Law Library patrons
Key Challenges and Outstanding Issues
The Law Library has seen significant declines in its income for the past four years, which has severely restricted our operating budget. Our filing fee income has gone from $260,000 in FY2010-11 to $175,000 in FY2013-14. This is a loss of $85,000 (33%) over a three year period. And the conclusion is unavoidable: filing fee revenues alone will no longer provide the Law Library with a workable operating budget. In fact, as of the date our report goes to press, a review of our income for the month of January over the past four years reflects a $2,000 per month decrease each year, from a high of $20,296 in FY 2010-11 to $12,812 in FY 2014-15.
In addition to drastically reducing our collection due to declining revenues and increasing costs for both print and online publications, the Library also slashed staffing costs. Whereas the Law Library once boasted open hours every day of the week, including eight hours on Mondays and Fridays, 12.5 hours on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays, and five hours on Saturdays and Sundays, it now maintains a schedule of only 8 hours on Mondays, 8.5 hours on Tuesdays and Thursdays, 11.5 hours on Wednesdays, 7 hours on Fridays, closed entirely on Saturdays, and only 4 hours on Sundays. A $50,000 reduction in publishing expenses plus a $20,000 cut in staff compensation, accomplished by reducing hours of operation, meant that for FY 2014-15, our annual expenditures were reduced from $260,000 to $185,000.
The Law Library was fortunate to receive a one-time contribution from the County's Community Services Funding for the FY 2014-15 year to allow us to meet our budget for the present year. The Board's focus will be on increasing revenue for FY 2015-16 in order to stem the continuing downward trend of further drastic cuts in our collection, staff and overall services.

Key Challenges and Outstanding Issues
•
Competing state and federal guidance and programs
•
Reduced local funding, reduced grant availability, and reduced staff time in key public agencies
•
Due to the fact that major disasters happen rarely and sometimes not at all in a given lifetime, a key challenge is overcoming economic, political, and social pressures on individuals and families that are distracting and result in a lack of long-term preparedness efforts and an appearance of apathy towards spending time, money, and effort in preparing themselves and their communities
•
No single government department or specialized public service agency can provide the County with a comprehensive preparedness and/or response capability that will preserve lives, homes, and the community in the event of a major or regional disaster; as such, preparedness efforts from multiple County agencies can oftentimes overlap, and would benefit in both effectiveness and efficiency from a greater degree of coordination
