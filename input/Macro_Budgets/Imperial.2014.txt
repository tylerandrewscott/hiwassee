The preparation of the 2014-2015 fiscal year budget began as usual in February
with direction to Department Heads and staff to focus on maintaining overall costs
including a reduction of 10% in operating funds (e.g. office expense, professional and
specialized services, travel, communications, etc.).
On June 20, 2014, Governor Jerry Brown signed a budget in the reported
amount of $156 billion including a General Fund budget of $107.9 billion. According
tothe Governor's office, the 2014-2015 budget "advances a multiyear plan that is
balanced, pays down budgetary debt from past years, saves for a rainy day, and shores
up the teacher pension system." In addition, the state budget "increases spending for
education, the environment, public safety, health care, CaiWorks, In Home Services,
and affordable housing."
Unfortunately for the County, it appears that the Budget included an extension of
the Property Tax Exclusion for Solar Energy Systems including commercial solar
projects, which was set to expire on December 31, 2016. This tax exemption reduces
the assessed value of the commercial solar improvements in the County from a possible
$2.2 billion to $70 million. $3.3 million v. $104,670 in property tax dollars to the County.
As required by the County Budget Act, the submitted proposed budget is
balanced but relies on a carryover balance of $8,737,079. Since 2007 the County has
averaged carryover of more than $10 million.
The revenue in the proposed budget includes an estimated $13 million in
property tax. This is an estimated increase of $210,000. Our Sales and Use Tax
revenue estimate includes an additional $2,000,000 over last years budget figure. The
primary reason for the anticipated increase in sales tax is from the anticipated
construction of renewable energy projects in the County.
In consideration of this, we submit for your approval and adoption an overall
County Rroposed budget assuming the following:

Anticipated Revenue:
Total Available Financing:
Anticipated Expenditures:
$ 75,254,341

The 2014-2015 Proposed Budget reflects 2,254.5 position allocations with 132
vacant funded and 283.5 vacant unfunded positions.
Should the Board decide to accept the proposed budget as presented, CEO
budget staff will then assist the Auditor-Controller's office in determining the actual
Carryover from FY 2013-2014. The Carryover balance should be determined by July
24, 2014. Thereafter, budget staff will work to finalize and prepare the budget for
Budget Hearings. We would expect the final recommended budget to be completed by
August 1, 2014 with budget hearings to begin on August 12, 2014. Final adoption of the
budget is to take place shortly thereafter.
