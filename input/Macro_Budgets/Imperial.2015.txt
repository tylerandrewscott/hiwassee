We present for your approval the Fiscal Year 2015-2016 Proposed Budget. As usual
our County budget process began in February. Direction to budget staff and department
heads was that operating budgets would remain as much as possible status quo. However,
while the direction was status quo there were changes due to salary costs, retirement
contribution rate changes, contracts with annual increases, etc .. Unlike fiscal year 2014-2015
departments were not asked to reduce certain operating expenses such as, office expense,
professional and specialized services, travel, etc.
Presentation of the County's budget coincides with a time when history in California is
being made. An NBA championship was brought to the Bay Area for the first time in 40 years
and our legislators approved a governor's budget by the deadline, avoiding being docked in
pay, is point eight of one-percent different than the Governor's proposal and it pays down debt
and provides additional funding to schools and low-income families.
While the state is enjoying better times the County too has seen its success in its
financial health as we have also bounced back from the 2008 housing bust and economy
downfall. We weathered those two economic disasters through conservative practices and our
departments whose department heads and staff recognized the seriousness of the time and
took on the challenges and extra duties when shortage of funding and vacancies occurred
thereby helping the County save funding resources in addition to avoiding layoffs or furloughs.
This current fiscal year and possibly the coming fiscal year we will not experience the
same level of one-time revenue from renewable energy projects we saw during fiscal year
2013-2014, but there will be some residual due to processing at the state. While there are a
few projects in construction the majority of approved projects have completed their
construction phase. Their completion means less sales tax revenue and because of the
extension of the Property Tax Exclusion for Solar Energy Systems there will be no material
increase in our property tax dollars from the completed projects.
We submit this budget to the Board at this time in accordance with the County Budget
Act that requires counties to have a balance proposed budget in place by June 30 thereby
allowing the County to conduct normal business on July 1. The budget we present is
balanced. We balanced the budget submitted by using an assumed carryover of $10, 717, 330,
revenue of $231, 746,618 and expenditures of $242, 459, 948. We are confident in the
carryover figure as the County since 2007 has averaged a carryover balance of more than $10
million. Included for your information are pie charts that reflect the proposed revenue and
proposed expenditures of the General Fund by County function.
The General Fund Operating revenue proposed in this budget is $3.2 million over the
2014-2015 adopted revenue. The difference is due to the residual effects from the completed
solar energy projects whose sales tax payments are not applied in the year paid, e.g. Prop 172
Public Safety, Triple Flip and VLF Swap.
Therefore, we present for your approval an overall County proposed budget assuming
the following:
Anticipated Beginning Balance:
Anticipated Revenue:
Total Available Financing:
Anticipated Expenditures:
$ 78, 885, 225
$389, 308, 737

The 2015-2016 Proposed Budget reflects 2,236.5 allocated positions with 153 vacant
funded and 274.5 vacant unfunded positions.

Auditor-Controller's office if necessary with the determination of the actual carryover from FY
2014-2015. The Carryover Balance should be determined by July 23, 2015. Thereafter,
budget staff will work to finalize and prepare the budget for Budget Hearings. We expect the
final recommended budget to be completed by July 30, 2015. Final adoption of the budget to
take place shortly thereafter.
