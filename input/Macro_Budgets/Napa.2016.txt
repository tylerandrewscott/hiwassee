Submitted for your consideration and adoption is the Fiscal Year 2016-17 Recommended Budget,
prepared in accordance with your adopted Budget Policies. You are scheduled to begin public
hearings for all General Fund, Special Revenue Fund, Internal Service, and Enterprise departments on
June 13th and to adopt the budget on June 21st.
BUDGET CLIMATE
Based on recent economic information, it appears that the economy may be softening somewhat. In
early May, the Legislative Analyst reported that State Personal Income Tax (PIT) receipts were $1
billion below Department of Finance projections, a combination of lower withholding of 2016 taxes as
well as lower receipt of 2015 taxes and higher 2015 tax refunds. April PIT was nearly $400 million below
April 2015 actual revenue collections. Further, the continued volatility of the U.S. stock markets since
January indicates a nervousness on the part of investors about the country’s continued economic
growth (albeit slow) post-recession. Specific to Napa County, the non-farm unemployment rate for
March, as reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, was 4.4%, a reduction of 0.5% from March 2015.
Napa’s unemployment rate for March 2016 remains 1% below the statewide rate of 5.4% and 0.6%
below the U.S. rate of 5.0%. Compared to the eight other Bay Area counties, Napa ties with Contra
Costa County for 2nd highest unemployment. Solano County, with a February 2016 rate of 5.6%, is
highest and San Mateo County lowest with a rate of 3.0% for the same period. Overall, Napa’s
unemployment rate compares favorably with both the state and U.S. statistics, although does not reflect
the more robust employment seen in the southern part of the region and within San Francisco. While
unemployment is not the only indicator of economic health, it does provide an indication of the
existing business climate and Napa’s may improve favorably as the summer tourism season begins.
Leaders within the local tourism industry recently commented on a softening in the tourist activity in
San Francisco, due in part to temporary closure of Moscone Center as a meeting/conference venue.
Other sources point to a weakening in China’s economy and the assumed reduction in Chinese tourism
as indicators of more moderate growth in sales and transient occupancy taxes. On the other hand, the
Assessor-Recorder just released the report of 2015-2016 property tax growth showing an increase in the
total County assessed value of $2 billion (6.39%) over the previous year. This increase is reflective of a
1.99% change in value for most properties as well as increases in value due to changes in ownership or
upward adjustment from a “decline in value” status. While much of that value is concentrated in the
cities and town, the County anticipates reasonable property tax revenue growth for the unincorporated
areas in the budget year. At 30.4% of total General Fund revenue, secured property taxes are the
largest non-departmental revenue source used to fund the cost of County services in excess of state,
federal, fee or other revenue. Overall, the County is budgeting revenue growth in property, transient
occupancy and sales taxes, although our office will carefully watch sales and transient occupancy tax
revenues as they come in and recommend adjustments if they are not consistent with the budget.
Given the current economic conditions and the assumption that a severe recession affecting Napa is not
imminent, the recommended budget remains consistent with the policies approved by the Board of
Supervisors in January. The budget does not include implementing any part of the Fiscal Contingency
Plan, but that remains an option should the economic conditions assumed when the budget was
developed suddenly change.
BUDGET PROCESS
The FY 2016-17 budget process began January 5, 2016, when your Board approved the FY 2016-17
Budget Policies and Calendar. Other steps in the process included:
• January 7th: Budget Orientation/Training for all departments. This year, operating departments
were asked to include progress on their FY 2015-16 goals in their budget narratives. Therefore
the first few accomplishments listed in each narrative reflect the progress.
• February 24th: Departments submitted their budget requests to the County Executive Office.
• March 22nd: A Mid-Year Review of the FY 2015-16 budget status was presented to the Board.
• March 30th: CEO Analysts completed their initial review of departmental budget requests.
• April 19th: The Assistant CEO presented preliminary FY 2016-17 General Fund budget
projections and your Board held a Budget Study Session to provide input into the
Recommended Budget.
As mentioned above, in January of this year, your Board adopted a set of Budget Policies to guide staff
in preparing the FY 2016-17 Recommended Budget. Using these policies as well as principles outlined
in the County’s Strategic Financial Plan, the General Fund budget is finely balanced and should remain
structurally balanced in coming years assuming that jail construction is funded and other programs
remain stable. However, uncertainties remain regarding the continued growth within the local
economy and its impact on revenues.
At the Budget Study Session in April, the Board voted to reduce the reserve for Fiscal Uncertainty to
reflect the fully funded status of the Fiscal Uncertainty reserve within the Health and Human Services
Fund. Previously, the General Fund Fiscal Uncertainty calculation included 10% of Health and Human
Services appropriations. This change frees up funding in the General Fund that will now be set aside
for future jail construction. Further, the Board voted to subordinate funding the General Reserve to
funding the Fiscal Uncertainty reserve while the emergency declaration related to the August 2014
Napa Earthquake remains in place. In 2014, the Board voted to use $13.9 million of the General
Reserve for earthquake response and recovery costs, in advance of reimbursement from insurance and
state and federal sources. As earthquake-related revenues are recognized in future years, they will be
used to restore the General Reserve unless the Board determines some amount should be held in a
restricted account for future audits. In addition, $4.5 million in excess revenues over expenditures from
FY 2014-15 was transferred to the General Reserve. In the budget year, an additional $2.2 million is
projected to be added to General Reserve, bringing the total to $19,951,442 or 77.6% of the
recommended level of 10% of net General Fund and Health and Human Services Fund appropriations.
Consistent with the policy, any FY 2016-17 revenue in excess of expenditures and the amount needed to
support FY 2016-17 budgeted appropriations will be recommended to be used to rebuild the General
Reserve to its policy level in advance of insurance and FEMA/CalOES reimbursements. The Fiscal
Uncertainty is currently fully funded at $15,150,452, and the Health and Human Services Fund Fiscal
Uncertainty is currently fully funded at $10,554,564.
Current policy guides that an Appropriation for Contingency is included in the budget at a minimum
of three percent of General Fund and Health and Human Services Fund appropriations. The
Appropriation for Contingency of $5,800,000 is included in the Recommended FY 2016-17 budget, fully
meeting the policy-level requirement.
FY 2016-17 BUDGET CHANGES
The FY 2016-17 budget includes three significant structural changes. First, Communications, Records
Management and Property Management subdivisions (budget units) were removed from the General
Fund and put into their own respective internal services funds (ISFs). Because these budget units
provide services for “purchase” by operating departments, beginning in the budget year the costs have
been allocated directly to the departments through the ISF mechanism. This gives a clearer picture of
the true operating costs of departments. In FY 2015-16, these three budgets had a combined net county
cost of over $8 million. The costs are now spread to the individual “user” departments, increasing
(sometimes significantly) their operating cost net of department specific revenue. This change affects
3
year-to-year comparisons in the overall budget as well as in individual departments. The result of the
changes on individual budgets is described in the respective department budget narratives.
The second change is in the way that OMB A-87 County overhead charges are calculated. Previously,
A-87 charges were based on estimates and did not include adjustments for actual costs. Beginning in
FY 2016-17, the allocated charge to each department is adjusted for prior years’ actual expenditures. In
most cases, the change resulted in a one-time reduction in A-87 costs. The change, combined with
moving Property Management, Communications and Records Management to internal services funds
resulted in a decrease of approximately $4 million in A-87 revenue within the General Fund.
The third change affects capital projects. The County’s practice has been to establish capital projects in
their entirety during the budget process. In the year that the project was occurring, an estimate was
made of the work that would be completed in the current year and appropriations for any work that
would need to be done in the subsequent year would be requested as part of the next budget process.
The result is that projects completed over multiple years would be budgeted over and over again.
Beginning in FY 2016-17, capital projects will be budgeted in full only one time. Any remaining budget
at the end of the fiscal year will roll over and requested to be re-appropriated by the Auditor-
Controller. Any increase to the project beyond the original project budget will then come to the Board
separately for approval.
POSITIONS
The Recommended Budget reflects a net increase of 12.5 FTE new positions. Departments requested
12.5 FTE new positions as described below. Two Community Aide positions in Health and Human
Services Self Sufficiency Services are requested to be deleted. The total cost of the new positions is
estimated at $1,506,856. The cost is divided between a number of funding sources including Federal
Bureau of Reclamation ($317,936), 2011 Public Safety Realignment ($168,862), various Health and
Human Services (HHS) revenue sources ($607,692) and County General Fund ($412,366).

The County’s Recommended All Funds Budget for FY 2016-17 totals $449,484,566 in appropriations.
This is a $44.0 million, or 1.2%, decrease in appropriations compared to the FY 2015-16 Adopted Budget
appropriation level. A detailed comparison of the FY 2016-17 Recommended Budget’s appropriation
levels to the FY 2015-16 Adopted Budget follows:
In addition to the $891,988 increase in General Fund appropriations described in detail in the next
section, the primary reasons for the overall decrease in appropriations are due to changes in the way
that capital projects are budgeted and the removal of Communications, Records Management and
Property Management mentioned earlier in this report. Changes to the All Funds Recommended
Budget compared to the FY 2015-16 Adopted Budget include:
• Overall Salaries and Benefits in all funds increased by $9.1 million (5.15%) from the FY 2015-16
adopted budget. Of that total, $6.2 million is due to negotiated cost of living adjustments
(COLAs) as well as normal step advances. Overtime increased by approximately $525,000
(22.26%), mainly due to a Corrections Department major capital project. Employee insurance
premiums increased by approximately $360,000 (1.76%). Retirement costs increased by $2.0
million (8.78%). Projected salary savings increased by approximately 20% for an additional
anticipated savings of $725,000 over last year’s adopted budget.
• An $18.7 million decrease in Operating Special Revenue Funds appropriations is based on the
following:

o The change in budgeting for capital improvements contributed to reductions of $21.7
million in the Roads fund, $1.56 million in the County Library fund and $1.4 million in
County Fire Capital Projects in the Fire Protection fund.
o Appropriations increased by approximately $5.0 million in HHSA. Salaries and Benefits
appropriations increased by $2.8 million (5.48%), mainly due to negotiated COLAs and
step increases. In addition, an increase of approximately $1.2 million in the Health Care
Enhancement Program budget (Division 20007) reflects the transfer of funding to the
state required as match dollars necessary to participate in the Inter-Governmental
Transfer (IGT) funding program. The dollars are returned to the County when the IGT
revenue is received and are used to augment current health-related services.
• The change in budgeting methodology for capital projects also contributed to a $36.2 million
decrease in appropriations in the Capital Projects fund.
• Internal Service Funds include Information Technology Services, Fleet Management,
Employee/Retiree Benefits, and Liability Insurance. Overall, appropriations in Internal Services
Funds increased by approximately $11.6 million. The majority of the increase is due to moving
Property Management ($8.0 million), Communications ($1.7 million) and Records Management
($800,000) from the General Fund into their own internal services funds. Other increases are
related mostly to salary and benefit costs and are spread throughout the remaining internal
services funds.
The County’s Recommended General Fund Budget appropriation level for FY 2016-17 totals
$197,061,713. This is an increase of $891,988 million or .05%, compared to the FY 2015-16 Adopted
Budget appropriation level. A more detailed comparison of the FY 2016-17 Recommended General
Fund Budget to the FY 2015-16 Adopted General Fund Budget follows:

The primary reasons for the increase in both revenues and expenditures in the Recommended Budget
compared to the FY 2015-16 Adopted General Fund Budget are described as follows:
REVENUES
• The FY 2016-17 General Fund Recommended Budget reflects a decrease of $906,866 (0.8%) in
Non-Departmental Revenue compared to the FY 2015-16 Adopted Budget level. The overall
decrease is mainly the result of a reduction in OMB A-87 County overhead charged to
departments due to the change in accounting for A-87 as and moving Property Management,
Communications and Records Management explained earlier in this report. Changes in
budgeted non-departmental revenue as compared to FY 2015-16 are:
o $4.3 million (4.4%) increase in Secured Property Tax revenue;
o $670,000 (4.0%) increase in VLF Swap Property Tax revenue;
o $2.5 million (-100%) decrease in Triple Flip Property Tax revenue (this revenue source has
ended and sales tax revenue is increased commensurately);
o $284,000 (-18.27%) decrease in Current Year Supplemental Property Tax revenue;
o $2.8 million (39.8%) increase in Sales and Use Tax revenue due to the elimination of Triple
Flip property tax;
o $683,000 (5.7%) increase in Transient Occupancy Tax (TOT) revenue;
o $2 million (-100%) decrease in excess ERAF. Since excess ERAF revenue is no longer used
for General Fund operations, revenue received, if any, will be deposited directly to
Accumulated Capital Outlay; and
o $3.7 million decrease in A-87 overhead charges to departments due to a prior year
adjustment and reallocation of some costs to Internal Service Funds.
In forecasting discretionary revenues for FY 2016-17, current year estimated revenue, rather
than the FY 2015-16 Adopted Budget, is used as the basis for projection. Total Property Taxes
are assumed to increase by $547,000 (0.7%) from the current year estimated revenue. This total
is reduced due to the elimination of the Triple Flip Property Tax/Sales Tax swap. When Triple
Flip is not considered, Property Taxes overall rise $3.1 million (4.0%). Sales tax is assumed to
increase by $214,500 (3%) from current year estimates and by $2.6 million due to the elimination
of the Triple Flip for a total projected increase of $2.8 million. Transient Occupancy Tax is
assumed to increase by 4% from the current year estimate. In alignment with direction from the
Board, the FY 2016-17 Recommended Budget assumes excess ERAF used for operations is
eliminated. Therefore, excess ERAF received, if any, will be deposited to the Accumulated
Capital Outlay Fund to be set aside for capital projects including construction of a new jail. Due
to the apparent recovery of the overall California economy and the Proposition 98 school
funding guarantee, it is unlikely that any excess ERAF will return to the County after FY 2016-
17.
• Proposition 172 sales tax revenue for Public Safety is considered semi-discretionary as it may be
shifted between public safety functions. In the current fiscal year Proposition 172 revenue of
$15.0 million is expected, approximately $409,000 above budget. For FY 2016-17, a growth
factor of 4% is assumed for a total of $15.6 million in the budget year, an increase of $1,107,409
above the FY 2015-16 Adopted Budget. Proposition 172 revenue is allocated to Public Safety
departments based on a formula. Department specific increases include Sheriff ($385,511), Corrections ($311,348), Probation ($209,225), District Attorney ($115,626) and Public Defender
($85,699).
• Departmental Revenues overall are projected to decrease by $1.5 million. An increase of $14
million in revenue in Declared Emergency reflects anticipated insurance receipts as well as state
and federal disaster emergency funds. An increase of $483,000 in Planning, Building and
Environmental Services reflects fees generated by increased workload. An increase of
approximately $360,000 in revenue in the Sheriff’s budget is related to a contract with the U.S.
Bureau of Reclamation for patrol services at Lake Berryessa. As mentioned in the paragraph
above, Proposition 172 revenues have increased by $1.1 million over the FY 2015-16 budget.
Increases are offset by a number of decreases in departmental revenue. A decrease of $14.7
million in Public Works projects reflects the change in budgeting for capital projects. A
decrease of $833,060 reflects the move of Property Management, Records Management and
Communications into Internal Service funds. A decrease in Housing and Intergovernmental
Affairs of $1.3 million reflects Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds that were
received in FY 2015-16 but not in FY 2016-17. The Agricultural Commissioner’s budget reflects
a reduction in revenue of approximately $680,000 due to the sunset of funding for European
Grapevine moth eradication.
EXPENDITURES
• Overall expenditures are requested at $191.3 million, an increase of approximately $802,000
over the FY 2015-16 budget.
• Salaries and Benefits are projected to increase by approximately $788,000. However, this is
reflective of the movement of Property Management, Communications and Records
Management from the General Fund to Internal Service funds. When these departments are
removed from comparison, the increase in General Fund Salaries and Benefits is $5 million
(5.14%) from the FY 2015-16 budget, due to cost of living adjustments and normal step increases
as well as increases in overtime, retirement, and workers’ compensation. Increases are offset by
decreases in extra help, holiday and standby pay, and health insurance premiums.
• Services and Supplies expenditures are projected to increase by $4.5 million. However, when
Property Management, Communications and Records Management are removed from the
comparison, the increase in Services and Supplies is $24.1 million. The majority is from a $16
million increase in appropriations in Declared Emergency due to major construction projects
related to the earthquake. Services and Supplies are expected to increase by $2.6 million in
Corrections mainly due to the purchase of jail beds in Solano County necessary to hold inmates
while construction in the jail basement takes place. Approximately $1.7 million of maintenance
and utility charges are included in the General Fund for the Old Sonoma Road campus and
common areas at the South Campus. The remainder of the increase is spread throughout the
departments, mainly due to the reallocation of cost of Property Management, Communications
and Records Management directly to the department receiving services.
• The Other Charges category of expenditures is projected to decrease by $2.0 million. The
decrease is mainly the result a water tank project at Lake Berryessa paid for with CDBG grant
funds included in FY 2015-16 but not in FY 2016-17 and an $869,000 short term loan to the Lake
Berryessa Resort Improvement District in FY 2015-16 that did not reoccur in the budget year.
• Other Financing Uses includes transfers to other operating departments as well as to Insurance
and Debt Services funds. Overall, Other Financing Uses is projected to decrease by $2 million
due to eliminating the transfer of excess ERAF funds to Accumulated Capital Outlay (ACO) in
favor of depositing any funds received directly into the ACO. The transfer of funds to the
Health and Human Services Agency (HHSA) decreased by $623,635. The amount transferred
each year is adjusted for any change in A-87 charges. Since A-87 charges to the HHSA
decreased, the transfer is commensurately decreased.
• The Appropriation for Contingencies is budgeted at $5.8 million, an increase of $90,000 from FY
2015-16. This is set at the policy level of 3% of General Fund and HHSA Fund appropriations.
FUND BALANCE CHANGES
The Recommended General Fund Budget assumes a FY 2016-17 beginning fund balance of
approximately $64.1 million, an increase of approximately $12.4 million, or 24.0%, from the FY 2015-16
actual beginning balance level2. The $64.1 million beginning balance is comprised of:
• $17,711,006 million in General Reserves. This represents approximately 6.9% of General Fund
and Health & Human Services Fund appropriations, not including the operating contingency,
the General Fund transfer to the Health & Human Services Fund, Declared Emergency
appropriations and the Intergovernmental Transfer in the Health and Human Services Fund.
This balance reflects the authorized use of $13.9 million in General Reserve to support the cost
of earthquake response and recovery in anticipation of reimbursements from insurance as well
as FEMA/CalOES, of which $2.7 million is expected to remain at the end of FY 2015-16. Board
Policy calls for maintaining the General Reserve at 10% of appropriations, net of the exclusions
mentioned above. In April 2016, the Board voted to subordinate funding of the General Reserve
to the Fiscal Uncertainty reserve while the Declaration of Emergency was in place. The Fiscal
Uncertainty is currently fully funded, so any excess revenues in both FY 2015-16 and FY 2016-17
will go to restore the General Reserve to the policy level. Recognizable Earthquake-related
reimbursements in future years will go to the General Fund provided that the General Reserve
is fully funded. The Recommended Budget adds $2.24 million to the General Reserve.
• $2.5 million in a Reserve for Loans and Advances Receivable. This represents funds owed to
the County by the Napa Berryessa Resort Improvement District (RID).
• $32.6 million “assigned” (or designated) for various purposes. Of this, $26.5 million is assigned
to “Fiscal Uncertainty.” Because the Health and Human Services Agency has resources to fully
fund a “Fiscal Uncertainty” designation within the Health and Human Services fund equal to
10% of appropriations ($10,554,564), it is redundant to fund the same level of “Fiscal
Uncertainty” within the General Fund. In April 2016, the Board voted to transfer $10,554,564
from the General Fund assigned fund balance to the Capital Projects fund to be assigned for
future jail construction. This transfer will be completed during the closeout of FY 2015-16 in the
fall. For FY 2016-17, the estimated Fiscal Uncertainty level is $15,150,452, fully funded with
existing assigned General Fund fund balance.
• The “available” balance of $11.2 million, which can be used to fund County programs. It is
important to keep in mind, however, that the above fund balance number is only an estimate.
The Auditor-Controller will determine the final fund balance number in the first quarter of FY
2016-17. Any revision to the Adopted Budget will be scheduled for your Board’s consideration
once the actual fund balance numbers have been established. If additional fund balance is
identified at that time, staff will recommend that it first be used to increase the General Reserve
up to the policy level.
SIGNIFICANT ISSUES
Over many years, the County has continued its prudent budgeting practices in order to maintain
structural balance. With the Board’s leadership, the County adopted and has followed Budget Policies
that have preserved a solid fiscal foundation and prepare the County for both positive and negative
changes in revenues. However, the County continues to face a number of significant unmet needs and
as well as expected increases in future pension and health care costs. The following issues will need to
be addressed in future fiscal years:
1. Capital Infrastructure Needs: The County continues to face many challenges as a result of aging
facilities. The acquisition of the new HHSA campus in December 2013 and the renovation that
will be completed in mid-2016 will add new, more modern space to address future service
levels. Construction of a new jail remains one of the Board’s highest priorities. A new facility is
currently planned at a cost of $103 million. While this will not fully meet the County’s need for
jail beds, it will significantly increase available beds, particularly for inmates with serious
medical and mental health issues as well as allow for programs that reduce recidivism in the
inmate population. The County identified approximately $35 million in existing County
resources and has applied to the state for $20 million in funding. Any remaining funds needed
will likely have to come from an outside source such as revenue from a new sales tax.
In addition, there are a number of costly renovations that need to be made on the County’s
remaining buildings which include: the Administration Building, Hall of Justice, Carithers,
Juvenile Justice Center, Sheriff facility, and County Fire stations exclusive of earthquake-related
repairs. In the County’s Five Year Capital Improvement Program covering Fiscal Years 2013-
2014 through 2016-2017, the Public Works Department identified $132 million in capital
projects. In coming years, staff will need to develop a financial strategy to address these
growing infrastructure needs. Public Works will begin work on updating the Capital
Improvement Plan in FY 2016-17, and will bring recommendations for prioritizing projects early
in 2017.
2. Roads: Public Works staff has identified the need for approximately $9.1 million dollars per
year in order to maintain a 70% Pavement Condition Indicator (PCI) on 416.8 miles of roadway.
The FY 2016-17 Recommended Budget includes $3,172,000 in General Fund appropriations for
this purpose. In line with Board direction, this amount will increase by $560,000 to $3.7 million
in FY 2017-18 and will continue at that level in FY 2017-18, the year that Measure T funds will
become available. At the same time, Highway Use Tax Account (HUTA) revenues have fallen
by nearly $1.5 million per year, impeding progress on planned improvements. While Measure
T funds may come in higher than originally anticipated, they are still a few years away. In the
interim, staff continues to look for ways to increase funding for projects.
3. Employee Pension and Other Post Employment Benefit (OPEB) Costs: The County continues to
make concerted efforts to proactively pay for employee pension costs in a responsible manner.
In addition, CalPERS has made significant changes in amortization and smoothing policies and
actuarial assumptions that will help agencies address unfunded liabilities in a proactive
manner. However, these changes have significant financial impacts on employer contribution
rates. The CalPERS Board of Administration has revised actuarial assumptions for expected
changes in retiree mortality, reflecting longer life expectancy and revised average investment
earnings assumptions, amortization and smoothing policies in an effort to reduce market
volatility. These assumption changes, went into effect beginning in FY 2016-17, will result in
near and long term cost increases for retirement benefits. Due to the assumption changes,
combined employer/employee CalPERS rates for miscellaneous employees are expected to rise
from 26.6% in FY 2016-17 to 30.0% in FY 2020-21. Combined employer/employee CalPERS rates
for safety employees are expected to rise from 38.7% to 44.2% during the same period. The
impact on the County budget will be less than the impact on many of our neighboring cities and
counties since the County shares rate increases and decreases on a 50/50 basis with employees.
The Recommended Budget includes $8.6 million in payment towards the County’s unfunded
OPEB liability. This represents 7.8% of payroll. The Board is committed to amortizing the
payments over 20 years and will have 13 years left based on that commitment.
Given these issues and other fiscal risks the County may be facing, staff recommends continuing to be
cautious, to control costs and to avoid major new investments in operating new programs. At the same
time, given the nature of the General Fund’s fund balance and the consideration and planning reflected
in the County’s adopted Strategic Financial Plan, the County is well positioned to respond in a careful
and thoughtful way to the impact of an unexpected and significant downturn in the economy.
The following are some of the key issues associated with the FY 2016-17 Recommended Budget:
County-wide Issues
• As noted above, employee salary and related benefit cost increases are due to cost of living
adjustments, benefit increases and step increases. However, the Recommended Budget does
not include assumptions for the upcoming law enforcement negotiations.
• Consistent with the Board’s adopted Budget Policies, the Recommended Budget reflects
payments necessary to fully fund the County’s Other Post-Employment Benefit (OPEB)
unfunded liability on a 20-year amortization schedule. The Recommended Budget includes
contributions of $8.6 million or approximately 7.0% of salaries and wages toward paying down
this liability over approximately the next 13 years.
• The County continues recovery efforts related to the August 24, 2014 earthquake. In January
2015, the Board approved use of up to $13.9 million from the General Reserve to support the
cost of response and recovery efforts until reimbursements are received from insurance and
FEMA/CalOES. Staff is recommending that the Board approve setting aside some revenue for
future audit exceptions. For FY 2016-17, an additional $21 million in appropriations is included
in the General Fund budget, reflective of anticipated costs in the budget year. Revenue of $19
million is anticipated to be recognized during the budget year, leaving a deficit of $2 million
which will come from the remainder of the Earthquake Reserve.
General Administration/Finance
The recommended General Administration and Finance All Funds budgets reflect total appropriations
of $123,455,061, an increase of $16.8 million; and total revenue of $175,937,775, an increase of $13.4
million. In terms of the General Fund, Net County Cost for General Administration and Finance
functional areas is budgeted to increase by $3,410,304. The following summarizes the significant
changes to the General Fund budgets:
• The Human Resources Division of the County Executive Office has an increased Net County
Cost of approximately $458,132 mainly attributed to the loss of revenue from Health and
Human Services for department specific services and increases in salary and benefit costs and
maintenance costs. The cost of the department specific services is now incorporated into the
OMB A-87 County overhead allocation.
• The Appropriation for Contingencies has increased by $90,000 for a total of $5.8 million. This is
consistent with Board of Supervisors’ policy to set aside a minimum of 3% of General Fund
appropriations for significant, unforeseen occurrences.
• Housing and Intergovernmental Affairs revenues decreased by $1.3 million and expenditures
decreased by $1.2 million due to the lack of a large CDBG funded project in the budget year.
Non-Departmental budget units are as follows:
• The General Expenditures budget is decreased by approximately $1.2 million, primarily to
reflect the reduction in anticipated transfer of excess ERAF funds to Accumulated Capital
Outlay and a reduction in the transfer to Health and Human Services due to lower A-87 cost.
These reductions are offset by an increase in Public Works Charges for maintenance of the Old
Sonoma Road campus after the move of Health and Human Services departments to the South
County Campus.
• The Declared Emergency appropriations increased by $16 million and revenue increased by $14
million for a Net County Cost of $2 million. The Earthquake Reserve will be used to support
this cost.
• An appropriations increase of $270,000 in the OPEB fund reflects an increase in the total retiree
health insurance liability. This increase is allocated to County departments as an employee
benefit cost. The County has spread the cost of OPEB over a 20-year period, and the liability
should be fully funded by FY 2029-30.
Community Resources/Infrastructure
The recommended Community Resources & Infrastructure All Funds budgets reflect total
appropriations of $76,643,356, a decrease of $72,284,102 and total revenue of $63,223,091, a decrease of
$44,558,215. Net County Cost in this category is $13,420,265, a reduction of $27.7 million from the FY
2015-16 adopted budget.
The following summarizes the significant changes to budgets:
• $65.5 million of the reduction in expenditures is directly related to the change in the way that
capital projects are budgeted. Capital Improvement Projects must now budget the entire cost of
the project even if the project spans over multiple fiscal years, ensuring the project budget
remains the same as a project moves through the various stages of design and construction.
Therefore, unless new budget is required, projects will not be re-budgeted each fiscal year as
remaining project budget will be rolled over each fiscal year as part of the Auditor Controller’s
re-encumbrance process. Since most capital projects will carry over from FY 2015-16, it is now
unnecessary to re-budget for the cost.
• An increase of $1,406,540 in appropriations in Property Management is due to salary and
benefit increases as well as increased utility costs and costs associated with servicing new space
at the South Campus as well as maintaining the Old Sonoma Road campus.
• Ag Commissioner - Sealer of Weights and Measures projects a reduction in expenditures of
$282,570 and a reduction in revenue of $679,493 for an increased Net County Cost of $396,923.
The decrease in revenue is due to the reduction of state funding for the European Grapevine Moth (EGVM) program, due to zero moth finds in FY 2015-16. The department reduced
expenditures to the extent possible without hampering important pest control activities.
• Appropriations in Planning Building & Environmental Services (PBES) have increased by $1.4
million and revenues have increased by $532,000. The Net County Cost for PBES has increased
by $572,000 and the Building Division is projected to use approximately $325,000 of its available
fund balance. The department is requesting two new positions to assist with increased
workload activity – an Office Assistant and Engineering Supervisor.
In terms of non-General Fund budgets, the following summarizes the significant changes:
• The General Fund Capital Improvement Projects division within the Capital Improvement
Fund includes a reduction of $37.1 million in appropriations in FY 2016-17. Now that the entire
estimated cost of capital projects are budgeted when the project is created there is no need to rebudget
for these costs unless increases to the total project budgets occur. In future years, this
will give a more transparent picture of the total cost of capital projects.
• The total FY 2016-17 Roads Operations and Maintenance budget includes $8.5 million in
appropriations and $7.2 million in revenue, a difference of $1.3 million. Like the Capital
Improvements Projects, Roads Capital Improvement Projects are budgeted only one time.
Therefore, the reason for the use of fund balance is directly related to the transfer of the local
contribution for various Roads capital projects. When the capital transfers are removed the
Roads Operations budget does not require the use of fund balance.
The Animal Shelter reflects a decrease in appropriations of approximately $20,000 primarily due
to Property Management becoming an Internal Services Fund (ISF), no longer being calculated
in the OMB A87 charges (County Overhead), creating a $23,000 credit in OMB A-87 to the
Animal Shelter.
• The Napa County Library operations budget reflects a decrease in appropriations of $796,452,
mainly due to the reduction in Library capital project transfers, as these funds were transferred
to the Library Capital Improvement Project fund in FY 2015-16. There are currently two Library
capital improvement projects included in the FY 2016-17 budget that are continued from FY
2015-16.
Law/Justice
The recommended Law & Justice Departments’ budgets reflect a $2,580,435 increase in appropriations
and a $1,105,225 increase in revenue for an increase in Net County Cost of $1,475,210 or 6.4%. Both the
Law & Justice and Public Safety Departments continue to implement and strengthen programs to
manage the impacts of the 2011 Public Safety Realignment Act. Significant changes for FY 2016-17
include:
• The District Attorney budget reflects an increase in Net County Cost of $569,700 reflective of an
increase in salaries and benefits due to negotiated increases and the addition of one full time
Investigator Technician position to continue the phasing-in of regular staff rather than the use
of extra help and one limited term attorney position to address workload demands through
December 2017. Revenue has increased by approximately 7% or $289,316 reflecting increases in
Prop 172 and 2011 Realignment revenue and various grant programs.
• Both revenue and appropriations are requested to increase by $97,343 in the District Attorney-
Consumer Fraud budget to reflect the increases in salaries and benefits and the new Internal
Service charges. This budget is supported by fines and fees related to consumer protection
actions and there is no cost to the County General Fund.
• Net County Cost in the Probation budget has increased by $995,804 due to negotiated salary
and benefit increases as well as the new Internal Services charges. Revenue is increasing by
10% or $629,824 and appropriations are increasing by 9% or $1,625,628 when compared to FY
2015-16. As mentioned in other sections of this message, 2011 Realignment formulas are
stabilizing which includes Probation and the Juvenile Justice Programs. This revenue is used to
support 10 positions throughout the Department.
• The District Attorney and Public Defender have high profile murder cases pending.
Appropriations do not fully reflect extraordinary costs associated with these cases. As cases
progress, the departments may return to the Board for additional appropriation authority, if
necessary, to address significant one-time costs.
• The Child Support Services budget includes revenue in excess of appropriations of $102,797.
This is due to one-time funding provided by the State to account for payroll processing that is
reflected in FY 2015-16. Other than this one-time payment the program appropriations and
revenue remain flat when compared to FY 2015-16.
Public Safety
The recommended Public Safety Departments’ budgets include a $3,989,379 increase in appropriations
and a $2,245,591 increase in revenues for an increase in Net County Cost of $3,866,312. A significant
portion (approximately 64%) of the increase in Net County Cost is due to the realignment of internal
charges. The Fire Fund is projecting to use approximately $2.8 million of its available fund balance.
Significant changes in these budgets include:
• Intergovernmental Revenues are increased by approximately 4% to reflect projected Proposition
172 revenue. In addition, 2011 Realignment formulas have now stabilized and represent an
increase of approximately $440,000. Charges for Services revenue in the Sheriff’s budget
includes revenue from the Bureau of Reclamation together with contractual increases for the
provision of law enforcement services to the City of American Canyon and the Town of
Yountville.
The Sheriff budget reflects an increase in appropriations of $2.4 million, mainly attributed to
internal charges and negotiated salary and benefit increases. The budgeted appropriations also
include the addition of two deputies to provide enhanced law enforcement services at Lake
Berryessa, one Senior Deputy Sheriff II as part of the transition from extra help positions in
Court Security, and the creation of a Sheriff Fleet & Facility Services Coordinator position to
assist in the performance of various duties such as overseeing the Fleet and building repairs.
The Coroner’s budget includes replacement of x-ray and refrigeration equipment that has
reached the end of its useful life.
The Corrections budget has an overall increase in Net County Cost of $2,780,073 due to two
major factors. First is the need for continuing the contract with Solano County for jail beds
while a major capital improvement project is conducted in the jail basement. This is partially
offset by holding four Correctional Officer positions vacant. And secondly, an increase of
$801,000 in Internal Services charges as part of the overall realignment of those costs.
• The County’s current agreement with Cal-Fire for career fire service is budgeted to grow by a
negotiated annual increase of 5%, or $523,000. The total contract for FY 2016-17 is $10,984,741.
The contract is developed assuming a worst case scenario in terms of overtime and incidentrelated
costs. In the past, actual expenditures are typically $500,000 to $1.5 million less than
budgeted. The Recommended Budget also includes the replacement of one Hazardous
Materials vehicle and some small capital projects at the Yountville and Greenwood fire stations,
and the Fire Training Grounds on Silverado Trail.
Health & Human Services
Overall, the HHSA appropriations total $105,545,643, an increase of $5.1 million from FY 2015-16.
Departmental revenues (excluding the General Fund contribution) are projected at $89,099,152, an
increase of $5.7 million over FY 2015-16. Highlights of the HHSA budgets include:
• The recommended General Fund contribution is $16,446,491 compared to $17,070,126 in FY
2015-16, which is $623,635 or 4% lower, due to a decrease in A-87 charges.
• Recommended changes to the allocation list include the addition of 5.5 Full Time Equivalent
positions (FTE), two of which were previously Extra Help, the transfer of three Limited Term
positons to Full Time Regular positions and the deletion of two vacant positions.
• Mental Health appropriations have increased primarily based on the trending usage of Napa
State Hospital, indigent contract hospitals and Institutions for Mental Disease placements and
residential services. A portion of the increase is due to the decision to record all mental health
hospitalization expenditures, including clients of Comprehensive Services for Older Adults
(CSOA), and the corresponding revenues in the Mental Health Division where the contracts are
maintained.
• Child Welfare Services appropriations have increased due to the addition of a Child Protective
Services Worker I/II to handle the increase in referrals, funded primarily by state and federal
revenue sources, and due to new services (and funding) for Foster Parent recruitment.
• Appropriations in the Health Care Enhancement Program increased by $1.2 million, due to
increases in staffing costs, an increase in internal charges as well as an increase in matching
funds that are sent to the state to draw down Intergovernmental Transfer (IGT) funds which is
returned to the County when the IGT revenue is received.
• The recommended budget combines Agency Administration, Fiscal, Operations, Quality
Management and Organizational Resource and Development into one Administrative division.
STATE BUDGET IMPACTS
• On May 13, 2016, the Governor released his revised FY 2016-17 State Budget. While there are no
significant changes from the policy areas, revenue estimates have been revised downward but
still reflect significant growth. Revenue estimates have been reduced by $1.9 billion, but that is
over a three year period of FY 2014-15 through FY 2016-17. The revised budget also increases
the estimate of funding going to education through the Proposition 98 guarantee by $626
million through the same three-year time period. The increasing funding for education has and
will continue to impact the County’s receipt of excess ERAF funds.
• The revised state budget includes a proposal to issue $2 billion in bonds to fund the
construction of housing for homeless. Approximately 6% of Proposition 63 income tax
revenues are proposed to pay for the debt service on the bonds.
• The budget also includes $24.5 million for rehabilitation programs for state prison inmates.
Impacts to local governments are unknown at this time.
• Staff will continue to evaluate the Governor’s revised budget as well as any legislative budget
actions and may provide an update during budget hearings if significant issues arise. We often
do not know what the ultimate impact of the State budget will be on the County until after the
County’s budget is adopted in June.
RECOMMENDED ACTION
Budget Hearings begin on Monday, June 13, 2016. At that time staff will present the Recommended
Budget and your Board will begin accepting general public testimony. Hearings on individual
department budgets will then commence. Once staff presentations and public testimony are
concluded, your Board will be asked to make decisions on appropriations, revenue and financing
levels, approve the capital assets and new positions and adopt any policy and other budget control
language.
It is recommended that your Board hold the scheduled hearings and then on Tuesday, June 21, 2016,
approve the recommended appropriations and revenue levels as presented, approve the recommended
positions, capital assets and policy items, and adopt the County of Napa Budget for FY 2016-17.
