To the Honorable Board of Supervisors and Citizens of Mendocino County:
I hereby submit to you the Recommended Budget for Fiscal Year 2015-2016.
The Executive Office is pleased to submit to you a structurally balanced budget for FY 2015-2016. I would like to
take this opportunity to thank all of our County Departments for their assistance in providing information for the
development of this Budget. The Recommended Budget addresses the needs of the citizens of Mendocino
County with a focus on maintaining and improving County services, investment in employees, investing in
critically failing infrastructure, continued long-term debt reduction, and building and maintaining the General
Reserve.
Summary of the Recommended Budget
The FY 2015-2016 Recommended Budget totals revenues of $228,802,184 and appropriations of $239,322,557,
which represents an overall increase of approximately 1.54% in spending from the prior fiscal year. The Budget
includes $179,400,738 in General Fund spending.
The Recommended Budget allocates $3,034,188 to continue funding the Capital Improvement Plan (CIP) as
prioritized by the Executive Office and the Board of Supervisors. The CIP includes preventative maintenance and
critical infrastructure projects, many of which have been deferred for many years. Projects include investing in a
new County property tax system, roof replacements, large scale maintenance projects, and facility
enhancements.
In keeping with Board policy, this budget includes placing $970,000 in one-time money into the General Reserve
for a total of $11 million, $500,000 into the Pension Gap Reserve for a total of $2 million, and an appropriation
for contingencies of $500,000 to cover unanticipated expenses.
The County continues to see signs of a steadily improving economy. The projected increase in discretionary
revenue is similar to the growth we experienced last year. We do not anticipate seeing significant revenue
increases any time soon. Because the general cost of doing business will continue to rise, including the cost of
health care and pensions, we must remain cautious and look for innovative methods of doing business that will
benefit the citizens of Mendocino County now in the present, and into the future.
Executive Office staff will return to the Board of Supervisors for Final Budget Hearings on September 8 – 9, 2015,
with a refined budget based on the FY 2014-2015 close-out and additional information relevant to the
development of the FY 2015-2016 Mendocino County Final Budget.
The County’s largest and most important revenue source comes from property taxes. Initial projections show Secured
Property Tax Revenues making a slow, but steady increase.
Mendocino County’s budgeted Sales and Use Tax revenue for FY 2015-16 is $4,667,900. This is now above prerecession
levels. We expect this revenue source to continue to grow at a slow, but steady rate and we will continue to
monitor the actuals on a quarterly basis as recent increases could be a temporary spike.
Mendocino County’s projected Room Occupancy Tax revenue is steadily increasing and is expected to be well above
pre-recession levels in FY 2015-16 with a budgeted amount of $4,352,700. The County continues to partner with
other organizations and agencies to market the County as a tourist destination.
The County’s Budget Unit 1000 is composed of the three primary revenue categories detailed above, in addition to
several others such as Tobacco Settlement Funds and interest income. Together the funds represented in Budget Unit
(BU) 1000, compose the discretionary general fund revenues for the County. We anticipate the end of FY 2014-15 will
for the first time show revenues above pre-recession levels and will continue a slow growth over the next few years in
overall discretionary revenue. The Executive Office will continue to monitor through the quarterly budget review
process.
