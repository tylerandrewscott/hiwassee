FY 2011-12 Actions that Impact the FY 2012-13 Budget Process
Labor negotiations were still underway for most bargaining units when the FY 2011-12 budget was in development.

As the year progressed, your Board reached agreement with 16 bargaining units, as well as addressing senior management, department heads and unrepresented employees. Unilateral implementation was imposed upon the remaining eight bargaining units to accomplish the necessary reductions, while maintaining basic County services, These reductions have allowed your departments to function throughout the year within the adopted budget appropriations.
