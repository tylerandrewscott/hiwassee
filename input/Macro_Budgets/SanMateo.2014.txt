BACKGROUND
The County Budget Act (Government Code §§ 29000-29144 and § 30200) requires that
counties have a Recommended budget, approved by the Board of Supervisors, in place on
July 1 of each fiscal year. On September 18, 2013, as part of the new two year budget
process, the Board of Supervisors approved the FY 2013-14 Adopted Budget and received
the FY 2014-15 Recommended Budget. The purpose of this budget transmittal is to seek
formal approval of the FY 2014-15 Recommended Budget. This Budget has been amended
from the one received last September to include adjustments that are deemed necessary to
ensure uninterrupted services and operations through September 2014. The Board will
consider the FY 2014-15 Adopted Budget, including September revisions and final Fund
Balance adjustments, on September 23, 2014.
DISCUSSION
The FY 2014-15 Recommended Budget received by the Board last September (the “FY
2014-15 Preliminary Recommended Budget”) totaled $1,933,663,450 with 5,343 authorized
positions. The updated FY 2014-15 Recommended Budget now presented to the Board for
approval totals $2,100,387,995 with 5,365 authorized positions, representing an increase of
$166,724,545 and 22 positions. The following tables display the Total Requirements and
Authorized Positions for All Funds and the General Fund for the FY 2013-14 Revised
Budget, the FY 2014-15 Preliminary Recommended Budget and the FY 2014-15
Recommended Budget. It should be noted that the FY 2014-15 Preliminary Recommended
Budget included a net increase of 42 positions, primarily due to the addition of 57 positions in

Key funding adjustments (Attachment A) are as follows:
1) Net proceeds from the sale of Circle Star Plaza, totaling $87.1 million, have been set
aside in Capital Reserves for future construction projects.

New Solar Panels ($7 million), Maguire Correctional Facility SB1022
local match ($4.0 million), Facility Condition Index Maintenance Projects ($4.0 million),

million, have been added; including an agreement with Public Works for Capital
Projects coordination, Devil’s Slide annual maintenance and connector trail planning,
Surfers Beach project, Moss Beach Playground improvements, Vehicle Replacement
charges, two term Park Rangers, and various other expenditures. Net County Cost
impact is $803,500.
7) Board approved adjustments to the AB109 Realignment budget, totaling $3.9 million,
have been included.
8) Board approved three percent increase to Community Based Organizations, totaling
$1.9 million, has been included. Net County Cost impact is $1.9 million.
9) Board approved Comprehensive Reentry System budget, totaling $1.8 million, has
been included.
10) Data Center and Radio Shop Relocation costs, totaling $1.8 million, have been added
and include the cost of equipment and the lease at 1320 Marshall Street. Funding for

the cost of the physical move has not been identified but will be addressed in
September.
11) A new Office of Sustainability, totaling $1.2 million and six staff, is added to the County
Manager’s Office to meet Water Quality Control Board requirements, adequately staff
the ongoing Energy Upgrade Program and better coordinate and respond to current
and emerging environmental issues. Net County Cost impact is $903,294.
12) Cal Fire contract adjustments, totaling $693,361, have been included to cover the cost
of an Administrative Chief to oversee Fire Station capital construction projects and
assist with general administrative duties, and a five percent COLA for State Fire
personnel.
Other significant funding adjustments include:
13) District Attorney Case Management System - $1,341,963
14) Preservation of 50 Treatment Beds - $900,000
15) County Service Area No. 11 Well/Storage Project - $840,000
16) Local Coast Transportation Management Plan - $600,000
17) Center for Homelessness Redesign - $100,000
The Net County Cost impact of all adjustments totals $20,872,490. The change in net
positions is 22, of which 10 have already been approved by the Board during FY 2013-14
and 12 represent new requests. The new requests will be coming to the Board in separate
Salary Ordinance Amendments on June 17 and July 1 (with the Master Salary Ordinance). A
summary of position changes can be found in Attachment B.
Fund Balance and Reserves
Fund Balance for All Funds has increased by $137.5 million largely due to adjustments in
Non-Departmental Services ($47.3 million) and the proceeds from the sale of Circle Star
Plaza ($87.1 million). The increase in Non-Departmental Services is based on mid-year
estimates and is considered very conservative. Reserves for All Funds total $350.3 million
and $174 million for the General Fund, representing 14.4% of Net Appropriations.
AB109 Allocation For Court Commissioner
The Superior Court has requested County AB109 Realignment funding to cover the cost of a
Court Commissioner to alleviate courtroom congestion and to ensure the County and the
Court are able to effectively and efficiently address the realignment caseloads transferred
from the State to the County. The County acknowledges that while the State provided
additional funding to counties for the realigned populations, the State significantly cut trial
court funding to the local courts. The added Court Commissioner should enhance the
Court’s ability to serve the County’s criminal justice caseloads, including the realignment
caseload. The total Salaries and Benefits for a Court Commissioner is $205,000. The notto-
exceed amount of $630,000 should be sufficient to cover the cost of the position for three
years. The Court will assume full financial responsibility for this position after three years.
This change will impact the reserve levels of the AB109 Realignment Trust Fund but has no
direct bearing on the County budget as these funds will be paid directly from the trust fund.
County Counsel has reviewed and approved the Budget Resolution and the AB109
Resolution as to form.
