Though cost management efforts continue successfully as guided by your Board’s adopted Three-Year Cost Reduction & Containment Plan, revenues are projected to fall short of expenditures again in 2014-15 by $2.5 million or 1%. In order to address this anticipated deficiency in revenues while minimizing the impact to service levels, this budget utilizes approximately $2.5 million from special, limited one-time funds. The continuation of a selective hiring freeze is recommended again in 2014-15 as a cost containment measure. It is important to note that the Proposed Budget is consistent with your Board’s direction to avoid the use of the limited Teeter Fund reserve and borrowed funds to finance the operations of the County.
Much progress has been made since the revenue shortfall was projected as high as $12.3 million during the 2010-11 Fiscal Year. Since then and through a series of strategic cost-cutting measures and reorganizations authorized by your Board, the revenue shortfall has been reduced significantly from $6.2 million in 2012-13 to $3.0 million in 2013-14 to a projected $2.5 million in 2014-15. Limited one-time funds are again recommended to balance the budget and compensate for the remaining revenue shortfall. As outlined in your Board’s adopted Three-Year Cost Reduction & Containment Plan, reliance on limited designations and one-time funds to balance the budget should be eliminated or significantly curtailed by 2014-15 to prevent depletion of these funds. Since the recommended 2014-15 budget still relies on approximately 1% of revenues to come from limited sources, the County Administrative Office will consider a recommendation to extend the term of the Cost Reduction & Containment Plan.
Governor Brown signed the 2014-15 State budget into law on June 20, 2014. Part of the State Budget impacting counties is still being modified through trailer bills and will be brought before your Board once details are finalized.
The following are general comments concerning the Recommended Proposed 2014-15 General Fund Budget:
The 2014-15 General Fund Budget has an overall increase of $5.5 million over the 2013-14 Fiscal Year. Following is a brief recap of General Fund functions and other points of interest:
? The General Government category reflects an increase of $1.9 million over Fiscal Year 2013-14. The increase is primarily a result of a change in the accounting for intra-departmental billings. These charges were previously budgeted as negative expenses and are now accounted for under the revenue category. When taking the accounting change into consideration, the net change in the General Government category is a reduction of $0.2 million.
The Public Protection category has increased $1.1 million over Fiscal Year 2013-14. The increase is primarily due to the following: operation of the Correctional Facility expansion, including additional positions, medical, food and utility costs; costs for the lease of the new Sheriff Administration Building and additional costs related to the Coroner function; additional position in the Fire Budget; and increased costs associated with the Public Defender’s contract.
? The Health and Sanitation category has increased $2.2 million over Fiscal Year 2013-14. The increase is primarily due to the change in accounting for intra-departmental charges as discussed under General Government.
? The Public Assistance category has increased $1.2 million over Fiscal Year 2013-14. The increase in this category is primarily due the administration of the Affordable Care Act and Protective Services, and is generally financed by State and Federal funds.
? The Education category (Library and Agricultural Extension) has increased $91,155 over Fiscal Year 2013-14. This increase is necessary for the operation of the Library at its current level of operation.
? The ending Fund Balance resulting from 2013-14 operations, which acts as a funding source to start the 2013-14 Fiscal Year, is estimated at $2,050,000. The Auditor’s Office is scheduled to complete the final June 2014 fund balance calculation after the close-out of the 2013-14 fiscal year.
? The Public Employees’ Retirement System (PERS) recently notified the County that the miscellaneous employees rate will increase from 20.505% to 21.837% for Fiscal Year 2014-15. The current PERS rate for Law Enforcement employees is 24.061% and will increase to 24.614%. It is anticipated that the rates will increase again in the 2015-16 Fiscal Year.
? Employee Compensation Increases All compensation adjustments that have been agreed to in a Memorandum of Understanding have been budgeted in the individual Departmental budgets.
? The ninth annual Government Center debt service payment is $1,676,232, and this payment is included in this budget.
At the preparation of this budget, there were approximately 209 discretionary and 181 subvented positions that are vacant from the approximately 1,476 County authorized positions. The 2014-15 County Budget currently has 157 discretionary positions that are recommended to remain vacant and unfunded for Fiscal Year 2014-15. It is proposed that from July 1, 2014, to June 30, 2015, a strict “Selective Hiring Freeze” be continued and managed by the County Administrative Office.
? Appropriations for Contingency is budgeted at $2,424,416 (1.4% of the General Fund budget) which is deficient for a General Fund Budget of $181 million. A prudent reserve is approximately 3% or $5.4 million. Additionally, funds are included in the contingency account to cover actual costs associated with a change of venue homicide case being handled by the District Attorney and the Public Defenders’ Offices, payout costs related to retirements; and other unanticipated events. This reserve amount may change at Final Budget depending on any reductions in State funding or changes in Fund Balance.
? Under the terms of the Three-Year Cost Containment & Reduction Plan, the County has successfully maintained a balanced budget but employee pay has suffered. Due to the cost containment measures, the County has not been able to provide for typical annual cost of living adjustments (COLA). Consequently, the employee pay scales have not kept pace with normal increases in costs for consumer goods and services or Consumer Price Index (CPI). There are also a limited number of job classifications that, for various reasons, have dropped significantly below the same classifications in comparable counties. There is a risk in not addressing these pay disparities, as the County will likely experience an increasing number of employees leaving to work for other agencies. The County invests a significant amount of time and resources into training and developing its employees, and that investment will be lost if steps aren’t taken to retain employees. Comparable and appropriate pay are essential to employee retention. In the coming months, the County Administrative Office will develop funding strategies to address the pay disparities and seek direction from the Board of Supervisors to prepare for upcoming contract negotiations.
