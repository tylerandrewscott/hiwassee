To the Honorable Board of Supervisors and citizens of Mendocino County:
I hereby submit to you the Recommended Budget for Fiscal Year 2012-2013.
It has been nearly five years since the ongoing economic crisis began. This crisis has forced Mendocino County to
adapt to a new revenue reality where cost increases have been relentless. It has now become clear that an economic
and revenue recovery for the County will be extremely slow and highly unlikely to keep up with future costs. We have
come a long way in just the past couple years to create a more sustainable organization – one that is most certainly
smaller, yet one that more accurately reflects the revenue situation presented to us. This is the new reality.
The Recommended FY 2012-2013 Budget before you is focused on retaining services to the public, paying down
existing County debt, preventing layoffs and accomplishing this within the revenue framework available.
The County’s largest and most important revenue source comes from property taxes. Mendocino County has been
fortunate in that this important revenue source has not declined as of the presentation of this Recommended Budget.
However, initial projections of a slight up-tick in Secured Property Tax Revenues may need to be reevaluated for Final
Budget.
Sales tax figures have been rebounding throughout FY 2011-2012, however we do not expect these figures to reach
their pre-recession high anytime soon. The County’s quarterly budget review process will be very important in terms
of monitoring these revenue levels and if there is a downward trend, the County may need to act by reducing down
expenditures.
Similar to the Sales Tax, this budget projects a modest recovery in the Room Occupancy Tax that is expected to level
off at this new FY 2012-2013 level. The County continues to be a robust partner in marketing our tourist destinations
and is contributing approximately $300,000 towards these efforts in FY 2012-2013.
This budget continues to take a very conservative approach with more historical sources of County revenue. The
recession brought the Timber Yield Tax to unprecedented low levels, and while there is an increase in this activity, it
remains well below past levels.
The County’s Budget Unit 1000 is composed of all the above revenue categories in addition to several others such as
tobacco settlement funds and interest income. Together these funds as represented in Budget Unit (BU) 1000,
compose the discretionary general fund revenues for the County and it is these revenues that the Board of
Supervisors wields the highest degree of authority over to appropriate. For FY 2012-2013 BU 1000 is expected to
perform slightly above the receipts for the prior fiscal year FY 2011-2012. Moving forward, it is expected that BU 1000
receipts will be largely static and the Executive Office will continue to monitor through the quarterly budget review
process.
Over the past decade the County’s General Reserve levels have been consistently under-funded and were even drawn
down during the height of the housing bubble. Throughout this period of time the County consistently never achieved
its own Board directed level of reserves. Nationally accepted standards call for a reserve of between 8 and 15 percent
of the general fund, yet in the lead-up to the greatest economic crisis since the Great Depression, the County had less
than 2% across the entire general fund. The consequences of this error are all too apparent. During FY 2011-2012, the
County was able to achieve a General Reserve level of $2,739,392 which is still only 27% of Board established policy.
This current CEO Recommended Budget places no additional funds in reserve as a direct appropriation; however the
reserves can be increased provided their are positive carryover balances at the end of FY 2011-2012 and FY 2012-
2013.
For the FY 2012-2013 Recommended Budget, the largest budgetary increase in terms of percentage was for the
education category as a result of the Library District’s successful tax measure. Public Ways and Facilities, and Public
Protection also saw additional increases due to project related grants, pension cost increases, and the public safety
realignment. All other categories saw decreases in funding due to attrition and labor concessions.
Retiree Healthcare: In FY 2011-2012, the Board of Supervisors opted to retain a limited retiree health insurance
program through 2013. This necessitated the first direct general fund draw for retiree health related costs in many
years. The costs in FY 2011-12 are estimated to be around $540,000 for the year and moving forward into 2012 the
costs could be significantly higher. The CEO’s Recommended Budget includes a $400,000 allocation to cover these
costs. This figure may need to change or benefit level reexamined in order to bring the expenditure into balance with
the FY 2012-13 budget.
Employee Healthcare Costs: The CEO’s FY 2012-2013 Recommended Budget included an estimated 10% increase in
healthcare costs for the year. This ten percent increase may have been low, and the County could experience a 20%
cost increase for employee healthcare. Appropriation levels may need to increase (with an appropriate reduction in
other expenditures) or benefit levels may need to be reexamined.
Sheriff’s Marijuana Reserve: On May 22, 2012, following the 3rd Quarter Report for FY 2011-2012 the Board of
Supervisors opted to place unanticipated revenues related to California Code Section 11470.2 placed into a
designated public safety reserve for the future use of the Mendocino County Sheriff’s Office. The amount was
expected to be no less than $683,759. The Sheriff’s Office for 3rd Quarter had projected a $1,247,574 positive
carryover balance before the transfer. The Sheriff’s Office intends to utilize these funds for FY 2012-2013 and these
funds are incorporated in this Recommended Budget as the total Net County Cost.
Reduction in Budget Unit 1000 Transfer to the Department of Transportation: As part of balancing the FY 2012-2013
Recommended Budget, the Board directed that the $3,300,000 transfer from BU 1000 be reduced by $1,353,958 and
applied towards de-leveraging the County from existing debt. The BU 1000 transfer had been thought to be protected
from Board adjustment through the Road Funds status as a Special District. These funds are however not protected by
a Special District Status as had been represented for decades.
Summary of the Recommended Budget
The Recommended Budget for FY 2012-2013 totals $216,417,195. The General Fund comprises $153,545,585 of this
amount. Discretionary general fund revenues are projected at $59,238,000. Last year during FY 2011-2012, the Final
Budget totaled $213,753,051 with the General Fund comprising $153,557,636. Discretionary general fund revenues
were budgeted at a conservative $57,324,000. Overall the organization continues to downsize, however the State
realignment has shifted more responsibilities onto the County, thus helping to explain the roughly $2.7 million dollar
increase in budgeted levels from the prior year.
The FY 2012-2013 Recommended Budget is balanced without drawing down reserves. The budget is balanced without
the recommendation of layoffs. It sets the stage for what is expected to be a stagnant revenue picture into the
foreseeable future.
While there are signs of an improving economy both statewide and here in Mendocino County, we have to be
cautious. County revenues tend to lag behind an economic recovery and it is certain that our property tax revenues
will be relatively flat at best when compared to pre-recession growth rates. This FY 2012-2013 Recommended Budget
is our second year of producing a budget that has not had to rely on layoffs to achieve balance. It is important that we
remain vigilant and continue to work hard so that we can continue this trend.
